START among the UNK of the UNK prize for literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of english STOP 
START of these there are surely few that would be more UNK UNK than UNK UNK UNK the UNK poet and novelist who received the award in UNK and whose UNK was celebrated two years ago STOP 
START equally a master of prose and verse he UNK the glory of UNK in the past and continues it into the present STOP 
START in the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself STOP 
START UNK was born in UNK of a UNK family STOP 
START on his father's side he was of german descent on his mother's he came of the old UNK UNK STOP 
START the family estate was situated near UNK on lake UNK in south central UNK STOP 
START it is a lonely rather UNK region but full of UNK and historic associations STOP 
START as a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary absorbed in his UNK for nature and his UNK of UNK ancient glory STOP 
START he liked to fancy himself as a UNK and to dress for the part STOP 
START being somewhat delicate in health at the age of sixteen he was sent to southern europe for which he at once developed a passion so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad at first in italy then in greece egypt asia minor and UNK STOP 
START in one of his summers at home he married to the great disapproval of his father who objected because of his extreme youth STOP 
START deciding to become a painter he entered the studio of UNK in paris where he enjoyed the life of the artists but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction STOP 
START he gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem the happy artists STOP 
START i UNK the world through printed symbol UNK and through the UNK UNK i UNK to see the inner man STOP 
START i looked UNK with my cold mind and with my burning heart STOP 
START in this final line we have the key to his nature STOP 
START few writers have better understood their deepest UNK STOP 
START UNK could never be satisfied by surface STOP 
START it may however be noted that his gift for color and UNK must have been greatly UNK by his stay in paris STOP 
START the first result of UNK long UNK abroad was a volume of poems UNK and UNK UNK UNK UNK published in UNK STOP 
START it was a brilliant debut so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets as did UNK UNK harold STOP 
START professor UNK book UNK foremost critic of the period UNK it as follows in this we have the verse of a painter colorful plastic UNK vivid STOP 
START in a bold sometimes UNK form there is nothing academic is seen and felt and experienced the observation is sharp and the imagination lively STOP 
START the young UNK UNK the french life of the streets tells stories of the thousand and one nights and UNK up before us the UNK of UNK STOP 
START in the UNK UNK of the east he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence and for that reason he loves it STOP 
START and yet amid all the gay UNK in UNK and UNK is a cycle of short poems thoughts in UNK filled with brooding UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as UNK and UNK which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the UNK language STOP 
START it UNK the unknown architect who designed the temple of UNK at UNK next to the UNK the UNK example of UNK classic style now in existence STOP 
START on the eve of his return to their native UNK he speaks with his wife of the UNK which rises before them in its completed perfection STOP 
START the supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled says the wife her husband has achieved immortality STOP 
START not so he answers it is not the architect but the temple that is UNK STOP 
START the man's true reputation is his work STOP 
START the short poems UNK at the end of the volume as thoughts in UNK is as professor book indicated in sharp contrast with the others STOP 
START it consists of UNK personal UNK such as the spark there is a spark UNK deep within my soul STOP 
START to get it out into the UNK glow is my UNK aim both first and last the whole STOP 
START it UNK away it burns and UNK me STOP 
START that little spark is all the wealth i know that little spark is my UNK misery STOP 
START a dominant motive is the poet's UNK for his UNK and its UNK associations not UNK but the fields where i would stray the stones where as a child i used to play STOP 
START he is utterly disappointed in himself and in the UNK life he has been leading STOP 
START what he really wants is to find a sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself STOP 
START this restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in UNK STOP 
START his cause was to UNK the glory of her past and to UNK her people to UNK it in the present STOP 
START he did not however find himself at once STOP 
START his next major work completed in UNK was a long fantastic epic in prose entitled hans UNK which professor book describes as a monument on the grave of his UNK and UNK youth STOP 
START the hero who is himself is represented as a UNK in the UNK lands of the east a sort of UNK type who to quote from professor book again even in the pleasure gardens of UNK can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life STOP 
START he is driven back by his UNK to the UNK UNK of his fathers in the forest of UNK STOP 
START from this time on UNK proceeded to find his deeper self STOP 
START by the death of his father in UNK he had come into possession of the family estate and had UNK its traditions STOP 
START he did not however settle back into UNK with things as they were STOP 
START like his friend and contemporary august UNK he had little patience with collective UNK STOP 
START he saw UNK as a country of UNK and narrow UNK indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory STOP 
START UNK remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build UNK from the ground up STOP 
START UNK conception on the contrary was to UNK the present by the memories of the past STOP 
START whether in prose or poetry all of UNK later work was concerned with UNK STOP 
START with the first of a group of historical novels the charles men UNK published in UNK he achieved the UNK of his career STOP 
START in scope and power it can only be compared to UNK war and peace STOP 
START about one-third as long it is less intimate and detailed but better coordinated more UNK and more dramatic STOP 
START though it centers around the brilliant and UNK figure of charles 12 the true hero is not finally the king himself STOP 
START hence the title of the book referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king the fatal UNK of UNK to quote from the novel the UNK he UNK for himself slipped down upon his people STOP 
START the charles men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories each UNK a special phase of the general subject STOP 
START somewhat UNK in interest for an average reader eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature STOP 
START they comprise a great variety of scene and interest grim UNK of war UNK UNK superb UNK of UNK events and UNK humorous sketches of odd characters STOP 
START the general effect is tragic STOP 
START almost nothing is said of UNK spectacular UNK the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the UNK people to their UNK king in UNK and defeat STOP 
START to carry out this UNK conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale STOP 
START his peculiar gift as had been suggested before is his intensity STOP 
START george meredith has said that UNK is the core of style STOP 
START of few authors is this more true than of UNK STOP 
START the charles men has a tremendous range of characters of common folk even more than of major figures STOP 
START the career of charles 12 is obviously very similar to that of UNK STOP 
START his ideal was alexander of UNK as UNK was UNK UNK STOP 
START his purpose however was not to establish an empire but to assert the principle of divine justice STOP 
START each UNK to be a god in human form but with each it was a different kind of god STOP 
START each failed UNK in an invasion of russia and each brought ruin on the country that UNK him STOP 
START each is still UNK as a national hero STOP 
START the first half of the charles men ending on the climax of the battle of UNK in UNK is more UNK UNK than the second STOP 
START after the UNK of that desperate and UNK campaign the character of the king UNK for a time into a UNK that was not merely UNK but often ridiculous STOP 
START like UNK he was the worst of UNK STOP 
START there are however some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part concerning the reactions of the UNK in UNK STOP 
START then more than ever before did they show their UNK and patient UNK STOP 
START this comes out in when the UNK ring which describes the UNK of the peasants in southern UNK to UNK an invasion by the UNK STOP 
START in the king's ride charles breaks out of a long period of UNK and UNK UNK his old self UNK from UNK and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years STOP 
START he finds it in utter misery and UNK STOP 
START all his people ask for is no more war STOP 
START but he UNK into yet another this time with UNK and is killed in an assault on the UNK of UNK being only UNK years of age when he died STOP 
START he had become king at fifteen STOP 
START then suddenly there was a tremendous UNK of popular feeling STOP 
START from being a hated UNK and UNK he was now the symbol of all that was UNK and best in the history of UNK STOP 
START this is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book a UNK funeral written in the form of an UNK prose poem STOP 
START slowly the UNK of UNK and UNK passes through the snow beside the black water and into the UNK lighted UNK the UNK of so many precious memories STOP 
START the guns are fired the UNK are sung and the body of charles is carried down to the UNK and laid beside the UNK of his UNK STOP 
START as he had UNK to be he became the UNK of a UNK STOP 
START UNK wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures UNK in UNK memory STOP 
START excellent in their way they lack the wide appeal of the charles men and need not UNK us here STOP 
START it is different with his volume the UNK and their UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students STOP 
START UNK written it is a perfect introduction to UNK history for readers of other countries STOP 
START some of the earlier UNK have touches of the supernatural as suited to the UNK background STOP 
START these are UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START especially touching is the chapter the little sister about a king's daughter who became a UNK in the UNK of st. UNK STOP 
START the record UNK with romance and adventure STOP 
START UNK UNK is a superb example and charles 10 the UNK of UNK hardly less so STOP 
START of UNK UNK and charles 12 it is unnecessary to speak STOP

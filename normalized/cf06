START everything must balance to the last penny STOP 
START also you can spell without consulting a dictionary for every other word STOP 
START you never are late for work and seldom absent STOP 
START actually you can take no special credit for this STOP 
START it is the way you were taught and your way of life STOP 
START all this is standard equipment for a man of your day stock in trade UNK STOP 
START however the last few years of your life things seem to be changing STOP 
START your way doesn't seem to be so UNK important any more STOP 
START you realize you are getting in the old UNK class STOP 
START to put it UNK you are getting UNK STOP 
START what's happened answer is a new era STOP 
START now UNK on the horizon are such things as estimated UNK calculated UNK and UNK machines STOP

START that's called progress new way of life face it had your day and it was a good day STOP 
START let this generation have theirs STOP 
START time UNK on to get back to the problem of retirement STOP 
START every UNK person has a different situation facing him STOP 
START some have plenty of money some have very little money STOP 
START some are UNK with an abundance of good health some are in poor health and many are UNK STOP 
START some have lovely homes some live in small apartments STOP 
START some have beautiful gardens some not even a blade of grass STOP 
START some have UNK of mind the ability to accept what they have and make the most of it a wonderful gift to have believe me some see only darkness the bitter side of everything STOP 
START well whatever you have that's it got to learn to live with it STOP 
START now question is how are you going to live with it can sit back and UNK and UNK your lot STOP 
START yes can do this STOP 
START but if you do your life will be just one thing UNK complete and UNK STOP 
START it seems to me the first thing you've got to do to be happy is to face up to your problems no matter what they may be STOP 
START make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life STOP 
START one thing i am sure of you must get an interest in life STOP 
START you've got to do something STOP 
START many of you will say well what can i do me are many many things to do STOP 
START find out what you like to do most and really give it a UNK STOP 
START if you can't think of a thing to do try something anything STOP 
START maybe you will surprise yourself STOP 
START true are not all great artists STOP 
START i frankly can't draw a straight line STOP 
START maybe you are not that gifted either but how about UNK around with the old UNK may UNK yourself and acquire a real UNK for it STOP 
START anyway i'll bet you have a lot of fun STOP 
START do you like to UNK making your own clothes or even UNK clothes interest you you love to run up a UNK UNK on UNK make neat UNK you do go to it STOP 
START there is always a market for this line of work STOP 
START some women can sit and UNK UNK UNK or UNK by the hour and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work STOP 
START where UNK is concerned i'm a total loss STOP 
START when you see a needle in my hands you will know the family UNK have fallen off and i have to UNK them back on or get out the safety UNK STOP 
START then again there's always that lovely old UNK of UNK or UNK UNK STOP 
START not for me but perhaps just the thing for you STOP 
START well about UNK tile UNK or similar arts and UNK people love to crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time STOP 
START how about the art of cooking you UNK to make UNK and UNK or special UNK and UNK is always an open market for this sort of UNK in spite of low UNK UNK cottage UNK and UNK to the contrary STOP 
START some people can UNK most anything out of a piece of wood STOP 
START some make beautiful chairs UNK UNK UNK houses etc. STOP 
START perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a UNK of wood of cutting your fingers maybe you would come up with nothing at all but then again you might turn out some dandy little UNK STOP 
START some women get a real UNK out of UNK STOP 
START they love to dust UNK polish wax floors move the furniture around from place to place take down the UNK put up new ones and have themselves a real ball STOP 
START maybe that's your UNK STOP 
START it certainly isn't mine STOP 
START i can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs STOP 
START perhaps you would like to become a writer STOP 
START this gives you a wide and varied choice STOP 
START will it be short stories fiction UNK biography poetry children's stories or even a book if you are really ambitious since i was a child i have always had a UNK to try my hand at writing STOP 
START if you do decide to write you will soon become acquainted with rejection UNK and UNK STOP 
START don't be discouraged is just being a normal writer STOP 
START just let the rejection UNK fall where they may and keep on UNK and finally you will make the grade STOP 
START few new writers have their first story accepted so they tell me STOP 
START but it could happen and it may happen to you STOP 
START then there's always UNK collecting UNK UNK UNK salt and pepper UNK UNK dogs dolls shells or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires can hear some of you folks UNK STOP 
START you say but it costs a lot of money to have a UNK STOP 
START i haven't got that kind of money STOP 
START true does cost a lot of money for most UNK but there are UNK that are for free STOP 
START how about a rock collection or a collection of leaves from different trees or UNK and in different colors take flowers STOP 
START they are many and varied STOP 
START also there's UNK books collecting newspaper pictures and UNK or any items of interest to you STOP 
START it's getting interested in something that counts STOP 
START as for me i am holding in reserve two huge UNK i love UNK to put together when time UNK heavy on my hands STOP 
START so far the covers have never been off the boxes STOP 
START i just don't have time to do half the things i want to do now STOP 
START so in closing fellow retired members i UNK you to make the most of each day enjoy each one to the UNK degree STOP 
START travel if you can STOP 
START keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be UNK sweet STOP 
START good luck one and all good days ahead important criterion of maturity is UNK STOP 
START the mature person is creative STOP 
START what does it mean to be creative a term we hear with increasing frequency these days we turn to UNK UNK we find him helpful as usual STOP 
START to be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist to produce where nothing was before to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power STOP 
START we are creative it seems when we produce something which has not previously existed STOP 
START thus UNK may run all the way from making a cake building a chicken UNK or producing a book to founding a business creating a league of nations or developing a mature character STOP 
START all living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of UNK if it is only to UNK a form like their own STOP 
START while man shares this UNK function with all his UNK in the UNK process he is the only animal with a true UNK and conscious creative ability STOP 
START an animal bird or insect creates either a UNK or nest or UNK in UNK UNK according to UNK STOP 
START man's great superiority over these UNK UNK is in the development of his imagination STOP 
START this gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and UNK forms STOP 
START it has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by UNK this inner image into its UNK in the objective world STOP 
START in our own time we have seen the most fantastic UNK of a UNK UNK come into UNK STOP 
START the vision of a lord UNK expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over london in the air UNK of 1941 STOP 
START in fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's UNK of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more STOP 
START it is in this one aspect at least that man seems to be made in the image of his creator STOP 
START not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms but even more UNK he can turn it UNK to help create new and better forms of himself STOP 
START we recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become UNK UNK dancers musicians and artists developing many UNK STOP 
START we know that actors can learn to UNK a wide variety of character roles STOP 
START by this same combination of the will and the imagination each one of us can learn to UNK permanently the kind of character we would like to be STOP 
START we must realize with UNK charles morris in his the open self that man is the being that can continually UNK himself the UNK that is himself the material for his own creation STOP 
START so far in history man has been too greatly UNK with UNK things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created STOP 
START is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between UNK of sufficient wisdom and character to UNK the tragedy STOP 
START is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to UNK our own UNK process UNK UNK in his book UNK of man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his UNK STOP

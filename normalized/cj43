START mr. justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article 1 power STOP 
START in this view supported by only three members of the court a power denied by the specific provisions of article 3 was granted by the UNK of article 1 STOP 
START if this seems arbitrary its effect was to treat citizens of the district of columbia equally with citizens of the states at the expense of expanding a UNK jurisdiction STOP 
START federal question jurisdiction for almost a hundred years we UNK upon state courts subject to review by the supreme court for the protection of most rights arising under national law STOP 
START then in UNK apparently in response to the UNK influence of the civil war congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority UNK with state UNK to decide cases involving UNK questions STOP 
START one purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights UNK by the civil war UNK against state interference STOP 
START serious difficulty arose with the UNK of UNK due process STOP 
START an amendment presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves became a UNK UNK upon state economic policy STOP 
START a flood of federal lower court UNK seriously UNK the processes of local government STOP 
START congress reacted with a series of measures UNK in various ways what it had granted in UNK STOP 
START in 1910 it required the UNK of a special UNK court for the UNK of certain UNK and allowed direct appeals to the supreme court STOP 
START such legislation was UNK and extended from time to time thereafter STOP 
START in 1913 an UNK provision was made for the stay of federal UNK proceedings upon institution of state court test cases STOP 
START the essential UNK of these measures resulted in UNK in substantial UNK of federal jurisdiction to UNK state public utility rate orders STOP 
START three years later similar UNK were imposed upon UNK against collection of state taxes STOP 
START this saved for state UNK in the first instance the two major areas where federal UNK had been most UNK but other areas remained vulnerable STOP 
START meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed UNK concerning this aspect of government by UNK STOP 
START drawing upon the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr. justice holmes introduced a series of UNK judicial UNK that UNK in mr. justice UNK famous doctrine of UNK STOP 
START whereas the earlier cases turned rather UNK upon the availability of adequate state UNK the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue STOP 
START the classic case is railroad commission v. UNK STOP 
START the commission had issued an administrative order which was UNK as UNK against negroes STOP 
START its enforcement was UNK by a federal trial court STOP 
START on review the supreme court via mr. justice frankfurter found southern racial problems a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to UNK is open STOP 
START an alternative was found in the UNK of state law as to whether the UNK order had in fact been authorized STOP 
START reluctant as usual to interpret state legislation such interpretation can only be a UNK rather than a determination mr. justice frankfurter led a UNK court to UNK the UNK STOP 
START but it is crucial that here unlike UNK the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the UNK question STOP 
START the resources of UNK are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a UNK constitutional UNK STOP 
START temporary UNK i.e. UNK is one thing to UNK is another STOP 
START to the extent that the UNK principle of UNK stands UNK by subsequent legislation federal equitable relief against state action must be available or so it seems to mr. justice frankfurter STOP 
START in alabama public service commission v. southern UNK co. the commission had refused to permit UNK of certain UNK train facilities STOP 
START the railroad claiming UNK of property without due process of law sought UNK relief STOP 
START the court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be UNK in the name of equitable discretion STOP 
START UNK frankfurter and jackson UNK in the UNK result for they found no merit in the UNK claim STOP 
START but they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction UNK in a valid act of congress by one fell UNK the court now finds that congress UNK in needless legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START by these measures congress so the court in effect now decides gave not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to UNK the act of UNK against all proceedings challenging local regulation STOP 
START a most revealing recent case is textile workers union v. lincoln mills STOP 
START the UNK act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry UNK commerce STOP 
START on its face this merely provides a federal UNK does not establish any law rights for the federal judges to UNK STOP 
START how can judges exercise jurisdiction to UNK national rights when congress has created none court held that congress had intended the federal UNK to fashion an appropriate law of UNK contracts STOP 
START in short congressional power to grant UNK authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress need not create or specify the right to be enforced STOP 
START the lincoln mills decision UNK a whole new body of federal common law which as mr. justice frankfurter pointed out in UNK leads to one of the following UNK 1 conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements 2 displacement of state law by federal law in state courts in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements 3 UNK of state court jurisdiction over these matters STOP 
START the UNK elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that UNK purpose was merely to make unions UNK STOP 
START with a few exceptions the UNK seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved to say nothing of the delegation of UNK power to judges STOP 
START to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr. justice frankfurter was prepared to read the UNK provision as concerned with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction STOP 
START this would satisfy what presumably was UNK major purpose the UNK of unions STOP 
START it would also leave intact the UNK traditional authority in the realm of contract law STOP 
START as we have seen the UNK and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases to follow state UNK rules STOP 
START here again mr. justice frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of UNK judicial legislation STOP 
START if congress wants to UNK the states from areas which they have UNK occupied let it do so UNK and UNK STOP 
START and let it do its own UNK and not leave that to federal judges STOP 
START does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the UNK of marriages is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases STOP 
START congress has not clearly defined the UNK between state and federal court competence STOP 
START it has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a UNK basis STOP 
START a careful student has suggested that in any new UNK of the judicial code the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their UNK in federal law might be used leaving to the state UNK the primary obligation of UNK state law STOP 
START obviously the goal here proposed is the UNK principle in mr. justice UNK opinions to the extent that congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion STOP 
START the same rule of UNK and division of labor UNK him in the UNK UNK cases in the administrative law area and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review STOP 
START mr. justice black no doubt UNK in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and just result STOP 
START he will not be UNK by UNK STOP 
START federal review of state decisions with few exceptions congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to UNK rights arising under federal law STOP 
START to put it differently state and federal courts have UNK jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right STOP 
START to insure uniformity in the meaning of national law however state interpretations are subject to supreme court review STOP 
START it may be noted UNK that to UNK desegregation an UNK and former southern governor has urged congress to UNK this UNK authority STOP 
START the result of course would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states STOP 
START it would also probably mean different things within the same state depending upon what court state or federal rendered decision STOP 
START we consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial UNK relationship STOP 
START the first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity UNK of the relation of procedure to substance STOP 
START subject to certain constitutional UNK in favor of fair trials each level of government is free to UNK its own judicial procedures STOP 
START UNK who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure STOP 
START a similar UNK applies to those who press state claims in federal UNK e.g. in diversity cases STOP 
START in an UNK controversy the state court followed established state procedure by UNK a vague complaint most strongly against the UNK STOP 
START in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the UNK by state law STOP 
START the result was that the UNK case was dismissed STOP 
START mr. justice black led a UNK majority strict local rules of pleading cannot be used to UNK unnecessary UNK upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law STOP 
START here as in the UNK case another element of state procedure was UNK to federal UNK law STOP 
START UNK frankfurter and jackson UNK one state may UNK UNK more than another one state may be more UNK than another to UNK reforms STOP 
START if a UNK UNK to UNK a federal right in a state court he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are UNK who press like claims arising under state law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated the UNK for instance with which a cause of action must be described STOP 
START federal law though UNK in a state court UNK the federal claim UNK what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it STOP 
START but the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state UNK in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long as a requirement does not add to or UNK the right as defined by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the UNK of litigation STOP 
START another problem in the area of UNK relationships is this what constitutes UNK error in a state decision v. chicago involved a conviction for UNK conduct under a local UNK STOP 
START the conduct in question was a speech STOP 
START the accused did not object to the trial UNK charge to the jury that UNK may constitute a UNK of the peace if it UNK the public to anger UNK dispute brings about a condition of UNK STOP 
START for present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so UNK limited speech as to UNK the federal constitution STOP 
START though the accused raised many other objections he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings STOP 
START that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right STOP

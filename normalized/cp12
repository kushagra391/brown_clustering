START i had a rather small place of my own STOP 
START a nice UNK apartment in a place called the UNK arms STOP 
START UNK she said hardly listening as she studied her left UNK STOP 
START and then i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START i'm not a man who has many close intimate friends carla he said wanting her to know all about him STOP 
START oh i'd drink with newspaper people STOP 
START i think i was what you might call a UNK man and yet it was when i was alone in my studio doing my work that i really felt alive STOP 
START but i think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with STOP 
START UNK he waited for her to turn to ask a question STOP 
START she showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home and it hurt him a little STOP 
START well what about you carla me asked turning slowly STOP 
START what about me did you make friends easily UNK UNK STOP 
START somehow i imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot STOP 
START how about it i guess so she said taking a UNK from her purse STOP 
START when she had wiped some of the UNK from her mouth she stared UNK at her image in the mirror STOP 
START are your people still alive asked trying to touch a part of her life UNK hadn't discussed he could have something of her for himself STOP 
START you talk so well carla he went on STOP 
START you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift for words he added trying to UNK her UNK STOP 
START you must have been good at history at school STOP 
START where did you go to school what is this asked turning suddenly STOP 
START don't you know all about me by this time UNK carla UNK STOP 
START this is my town STOP 
START i sleep with you STOP 
START you know something more about me every day don't you you be happier if i made up some stories about my life told you some lies are you trying to worry me i'm not trying to worry you STOP 
START well all right then STOP 
START the UNK tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another hoping she would notice what he was doing STOP 
START at home he had been a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his UNK STOP 
START was she just naturally UNK about everything but her physical appearance wondered STOP 
START would he have to clean up after her every day clean the kitchen the bathroom and get down on his knees and UNK the kitchen floor then hang up her UNK pick up her UNK make the bed while she lay around straightened up ready to UNK his UNK then grew afraid STOP 
START if he UNK on the UNK he suffered he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose his view of her too STOP 
START what's the matter asked suddenly STOP 
START nothing STOP 
START nothing at all he said quietly STOP 
START let's go out STOP 
START are those the only shoes you have sam what's the matter with them the heavy thick UNK STOP 
START look at them STOP 
START they're an expensive english shoe for walking around a lot STOP 
START i like them STOP 
START sam no one around here UNK such heavy UNK STOP 
START can't you get another pair maybe i could he said surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him STOP 
START i'll get an elegant pair of UNK italian shoes tomorrow carla STOP 
START and i don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit she said making a face STOP 
START what's the matter with it had put on the gray jacket and the UNK UNK and the UNK shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had encountered her on the street STOP 
START oh sam STOP 
START you look like a UNK englishman STOP 
START can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged i don't mind at all he said delighted with her attention STOP 
START changing his clothes he put on his UNK UNK suit and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good STOP 
START but it was a hopeful sign he told himself STOP 
START she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in UNK STOP 
START that day they UNK around just getting the feel of the city STOP 
START they looked at the UNK of the old roman wall on the lower via UNK then they went to the UNK gardens STOP 
START she had some amusing UNK about the UNK in the old days STOP 
START then they took a taxi to UNK STOP 
START there's a church you should see she said STOP 
START and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been there with UNK STOP 
START he let her tell him all about the church STOP 
START then they had dinner STOP 
START all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself STOP 
START when they got home at midnight she was tired out STOP 
START and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church UNK were UNK STOP 
START he had never heard so many UNK and as he lay there listening he thought of her UNK him for his remarks when he had looked up at the UNK and the church at the top of the spanish steps STOP 
START it was a good thing that she clung to her religion he thought STOP 
START she might like to take him to st. UNK STOP 
START carla wake up he said shaking her STOP 
START it's ten o'clock STOP 
START aren't you going out to mass could take me to st. UNK STOP 
START UNK she muttered STOP 
START come on you'll be late STOP 
START i think i'll sleep in this morning she said UNK and as she UNK against him he wondered if she ever went to church STOP 
START why did he want her to go to church wondered probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security STOP 
START it would be good for her STOP 
START it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church STOP 
START not his poor mother's fault STOP 
START she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible STOP 
START as for himself he just didn't have the UNK for it STOP 
START from the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain UNK and UNK by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know STOP 
START then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the UNK chapel STOP 
START just figures out of a UNK folklore STOP 
START could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old UNK UNK her imagination now a woman though she would take only what she needed from church STOP 
START it was too bad he wasn't a catholic himself STOP 
START or a protestant or one of those amusing UNK UNK or a strict orthodox communist STOP 
START what was the matter with him that they all UNK him was the times he was sure STOP 
START all the UNK changing from day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one of them for an UNK of his freedom was all too UNK STOP 
START look somewhere else STOP 
START but where the same he thought UNK over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she got up and went to church STOP 
START a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the UNK hearing them UNK down the stairs would think they were going to a late mass STOP 
START it seemed to him that if the UNK felt sure of them could place them it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla STOP 
START since we're having coffee with them this afternoon he said i think i'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us STOP 
START and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it sam STOP 
START there's so little to do STOP 
START why not said STOP 
START i'm not good at that kind of thing STOP 
START this afternoon let's take an air with them STOP 
START let's be fine superior people of great dignity he said as if he were UNK STOP 
START if you find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the UNK STOP 
START i am what i am STOP 
START i can't help it STOP 
START her words remained with him UNK him for hours STOP 
START he didn't know how she would behave with other people STOP 
START when they walked into the UNK apartment the old lady UNK and smiling said softly STOP 
START UNK and put out her hand STOP 
START her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes UNK and with her little UNK she said all the UNK things STOP 
START UNK smiling too said UNK and then more slowly i am happy STOP 
START and they sat down and began their little coffee party STOP 
START the UNK offered them UNK with the coffee STOP 
START acting only as UNK carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal STOP 
START she would turn to them then turn to him then turn again STOP 
START watching her he felt like a UNK at a tennis game with the ball being bounced back and forth STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK her head UNK asked sam about canada having a special interest STOP 
START carla translated STOP 
START the old woman had a UNK from north italy a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the UNK unemployment and who had UNK to canada to work on the railway STOP 
START for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a UNK STOP 
START did many of UNK UNK live in UNK in the bush sam ever lived in a UNK wanted to know STOP 
START UNK sam explained that he had no experience with UNK STOP 
START just the same the old woman said she would write to her UNK in his UNK and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country STOP 
START and sam UNK her and hoped he might meet her UNK back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope STOP 
START a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black eyes UNK STOP 
START an intellectual STOP 
START but very UNK too STOP 
START it was said that he had had a vision STOP 
START just as thousands that day in UNK had seen the sun dancing in the sky he had seen the same thing later in his own garden and she turned to UNK for UNK STOP 
START UNK had been sitting quietly listening with the UNK of the unaware STOP 
START now a little flush came on her pale UNK face and UNK in her eyes STOP 
START the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great UNK of the world STOP 
START yes the pope could die and quickly be made a saint STOP 
START no he was indeed a saint now STOP 
START UNK UNK and swelling with importance the old lady whispered UNK STOP 
START there was a certain UNK among the UNK STOP 
START the pope in the UNK of his great UNK had neglected them a little STOP 
START there would be changes made and UNK raymond should understand that when the pope died it was like the end of a regime in rome STOP 
START jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent STOP 
START did UNK raymond understand he did sam said UNK trying to get UNK eye STOP 
START surely she could see that these women were her UNK too he thought STOP 
START UNK orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or UNK or ireland STOP 
START but UNK eyes were on UNK whose UNK face and UNK eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness STOP 
START and carla watching in wonder turned to sam STOP 
START it means so much to her STOP 
START it's like a flame i guess she said in a UNK tone STOP

START the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the UNK nerves STOP 
START UNK player the small trim south african was the eventual UNK but in all his 25 years he never spent a more UNK afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap STOP 
START arnold palmer the defending champion lost his title on the UNK hole after a few minutes of UNK that left even his fellow UNK UNK in UNK STOP 
START just when you think you have it UNK this golf course can get up and UNK you player had said one afternoon UNK through the tournament STOP 
START and that is just what happened on the last few holes STOP 
START the UNK national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer STOP 
START player was the first to feel its teeth STOP 
START after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 two strokes under par on this fifth and final day of the tournament UNK fourth round had been washed out by a violent UNK when it was only half completed UNK game rapidly fell to pieces STOP 
START he UNK the UNK STOP 
START after a journey through woods and stream he UNK the UNK STOP 
START he UNK the 15th by missing a short UNK and finally UNK through the last three holes without further UNK for a UNK UNK and a UNK total of UNK STOP 
START as he signed his UNK and walked off the course player was almost in tears STOP 
START he could read on the nearby UNK that palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke STOP 
START palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at one point in the afternoon had UNK by as many as six strokes STOP 
START now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the UNK and the biggest single UNK in golf STOP 
START when palmer hit a good straight drive up the UNK on the UNK hole he seemed to have the UNK won STOP 
START but the UNK shot he used to approach the green UNK into a UNK and UNK in a slight depression STOP 
START in trying to hit it out with a sand UNK palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower STOP 
START afterwards palmer told charlie UNK his UNK partner that he simply played the hole too fast STOP 
START he did seem UNK on his second and third shots but then there was an UNK wait of several minutes while UNK UNK UNK out giving palmer a chance to recover his UNK which he had quite UNK lost STOP 
START when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he UNK the hole by 15 feet STOP 
START palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman UNK roberts' UNK apartment stared in UNK when palmer missed the UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK for the four rounds at UNK was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next UNK pro but it was barely good enough for a UNK tie with UNK STOP 
START the lean and UNK oklahoma amateur who has been playing UNK tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters UNK UNK him and closed the tournament with his second straight UNK STOP 
START end at seven until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven UNK rounds of golf at the masters four last year and three this without ever being out of first place STOP 
START as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a UNK UNK UNK this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of UNK and UNK STOP 
START his UNK total of UNK was three strokes better than the next best score a UNK by bill UNK the tall and deliberate UNK who had been playing very well all winter long STOP 
START but palmer knew as did everybody else at UNK that his UNK was about to be broken STOP 
START half an hour after he finished his round player UNK out at the UNK green with a UNK and a UNK total of UNK four strokes ahead of palmer STOP 
START more than a UNK had ended STOP 
START long after the UNK climate and the UNK final round on sunday have become UNK UNK the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the UNK a UNK between arnold palmer and UNK player STOP 
START unlike most such sports UNK it appeared to have developed almost UNK although this was not exactly the case STOP 
START when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge UNK towering prestige STOP 
START as if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight UNK STOP 
START player won only one STOP 
START but as the tour reached UNK a month ago player was leading palmer in official UNK by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere STOP 
START on the final round at UNK the luck of the draw UNK palmer and player in the same UNK and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting UNK in sport for a long time to come STOP 
START on that final sunday at UNK neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it STOP 
START but UNK of these two finished ahead of the other would be the UNK financial leader of the tour STOP 
START player immediately proved he was not in the least UNK by the dramatic UNK of palmer STOP 
START he UNK palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to UNK UNK STOP 
START thereafter until the masters player gradually increased his lead over palmer in UNK and added one more tournament victory at miami STOP 
START when they reached UNK last week together they had won five of the 13 UNK to date STOP 
START instant UNK on thursday the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and player developed instantly STOP 
START it was a UNK UNK day but a good one on which to score over the UNK national course STOP 
START the usually UNK UNK were moist and soft so the UNK were able to strike their approach shots UNK at the UNK and UNK firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob UNK STOP 
START but player was only one stroke back with a UNK STOP 
START even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous UNK of spectators unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever that this tournament was to be essentially a match between palmer and player STOP 
START a lot of people were still thinking about jack UNK the spectacular young amateur who had a 70 ken UNK who had a somewhat UNK UNK but was bound to do better UNK whose accurate short game and UNK UNK can overcome so many of UNK UNK even old byron nelson whose excellent UNK made one wonder if he had solved the UNK aspects of golf STOP 
START on thursday nobody except charlie UNK was thinking of charlie UNK STOP 
START on friday a day as UNK and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus STOP 
START UNK had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were on the course separated as they were UNK to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour they could see on the numerous UNK spotted around the course that UNK who ended with a UNK was not having a good day STOP 
START as player began his second round in a UNK with amateur bill UNK his share of the gallery was not UNK large for a UNK STOP 
START player began with a UNK on the first hole added five straight UNK and then another UNK at the UNK STOP 
START on the back nine he began to acquire the UNK wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament STOP 
START he UNK the UNK the 15th and the UNK five UNK one UNK and 12 UNK for a UNK STOP 
START starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion UNK UNK palmer UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK and the UNK four UNK one UNK and 13 UNK for a UNK STOP 
START the roar of UNK gallery as he sank a UNK UNK would roll out across the UNK landscape of UNK only to be answered moments later by the roar of UNK gallery for a similar triumph STOP 
START at one point late in the day when palmer was UNK up a UNK UNK on the UNK a UNK UNK from the direction of the UNK green UNK announced that player had UNK the final hole STOP 
START without so much as a UNK or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had palmer proceeded to sink his UNK and his gallery sent its explosive UNK rolling back along the UNK UNK in reply STOP 
START the UNK of UNK anyone who now UNK that a personal UNK was under way had only to watch how these UNK gifted UNK were playing this most difficult golf course STOP 
START it is almost UNK that UNK who UNK the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a UNK UNK on violence STOP 
START the bad luck that can so often UNK a UNK round of golf is simply UNK and UNK by the UNK UNK of these UNK STOP 
START bob jones played that way STOP 
START byron nelson did hogan did STOP 
START and last week at the masters palmer and player did STOP 
START as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the UNK was resumed in earnest it was UNK superior UNK that carried him into the lead STOP 
START this day palmer had started first STOP 
START as player stepped on the first UNK he knew that palmer had UNK the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day STOP 
START player immediately proceeded to follow suit STOP 
START in fact he went on to UNK the UNK and UNK as well to go 4 under par for the first eight holes STOP 
START but UNK real test came on the ninth hole a UNK UNK to the left measuring UNK yards STOP 
START he hit a poor UNK shot pulling it off into the pine woods UNK the UNK and first UNK STOP 
START having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than UNK yards out STOP 
START player then had the choice of UNK the ball safely out of the woods to the UNK UNK and settling for a UNK 5 or gambling STOP 
START the latter involved hitting a full UNK out to the first UNK and toward the UNK hoping to slice it back to the deeply UNK UNK green STOP 
START i was hitting the ball well player said later and i felt strong STOP 
START when you're playing like that you'd better attack STOP 
START player attacked with his UNK and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget STOP 
START it struck the UNK green on the fly and stopped just off the edge STOP 
START from there he UNK back and sank his UNK for a par 4 STOP 
START palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles STOP 
START they started on the UNK hole a UNK UNK STOP 
START on this day the wind had switched UNK from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days STOP 
START at the UNK UNK palmer chose to hit a UNK when a UNK was the proper club so he put the ball in a UNK in front of the green STOP 
START his UNK 4 on this hole and subsequent UNK at 5 and 7 along with a UNK at 8 brought him back to even par STOP 
START starting the second nine palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it STOP

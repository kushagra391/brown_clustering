START UNK long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up STOP 
START happened to be in the hall to hear you quarrel about her well you can't really blame UNK STOP 
START she lost her UNK to you STOP 
START but she was talking of UNK when she saw the black line of the open door remembered it clearly STOP 
START maude went on STOP 
START i've got to get busy STOP 
START miss UNK taken to her bed with the door locked STOP 
START she opened it an inch and UNK out the keys for me to give you STOP 
START here she thrust a bundle of keys UNK on a thick red UNK into UNK hand STOP 
START not that there's much use in locking up the UNK and the UNK now STOP 
START drink your coffee coffee STOP 
START it's cold STOP 
START maude suddenly looked quite capable of UNK it down her throat STOP 
START i don't want it sarah said firmly STOP 
START oh STOP 
START well i'll take it down with me as i go STOP 
START maude UNK up the cup and UNK up her top UNK as if about to take off with a racing start STOP 
START at the door she turned back her roman nose looking very long now and UNK STOP 
START i forgot STOP 
START ben and UNK have gone after them STOP 
START it's just like that book your northern friend wrote except there aren't any ice UNK to cross and no UNK STOP 
START i don't know mrs. UNK STOP 
START what can they do if they find them they can't do anything STOP 
START it's silly childish running after them like that STOP 
START i told ben so STOP 
START but of course the UNK won't be of any help not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around god knows where STOP 
START she had UNK away she had been gone for a long time probably when sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her UNK out the coffee so no one would drink it STOP 
START but then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but UNK especially that cup was deeply UNK sure that UNK had filled it with opium STOP 
START she had UNK with UNK she had UNK his demands for money and if she died by the provisions of her marriage contract UNK would UNK UNK not only the immediate sum of gold under the UNK in the office but later when the war was over her father's entire estate STOP 
START she felt cold and hot UNK and UNK at the same time STOP 
START now wait a minute she told herself think about it is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee STOP 
START she had lost a bottle of opium but that was on the trip from new orleans STOP 
START or someone had taken it during her first day at UNK STOP 
START yes she had missed it after her talk with UNK after dinner just before UNK was shot STOP 
START UNK or glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing back her washed clothes STOP 
START so somebody else could have come in too then or later while she was out of the room STOP 
START it would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor STOP 
START it was not very reasonable to believe that UNK had UNK UNK opium and come back to UNK with a formed plan to murder her STOP 
START he didn't even know that she was there STOP 
START and he certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the UNK yes and UNK fool he had every right to expect STOP 
START no he had been surprised UNK surprised but surprised STOP 
START then somebody else question UNK had said don't invite danger STOP 
START her skin crawled UNK had told maude that she was in the hall and the door was open STOP 
START sarah had begun to tell UNK of UNK she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a UNK of UNK in the hall STOP 
START so UNK or anybody could have listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium STOP 
START that was not reasonable either STOP 
START the opium had disappeared before UNK death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have UNK UNK own doubts and UNK and questions STOP 
START she began to doubt whether there had been in fact a UNK dose of opium in the cup STOP 
START so suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave UNK made a certain amount of logic STOP 
START added to the argument was the fact that while she might have UNK the coffee if it had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by its taste STOP 
START no STOP 
START it was merely an attempt to frighten her STOP 
START she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested wouldn't run like a scared cat STOP 
START but well she'd be very careful STOP 
START she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life STOP 
START but before she left her room she dug into her big UNK bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken STOP 
START so somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died STOP 
START UNK had known all along STOP 
START UNK didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract and find out STOP 
START he could UNK have wished to make sure loved UNK it was like a part of his breath and body had stressed the need for money STOP 
START UNK would never have tried to give her UNK thrust the envelope back in the bag was no point in locking it up in the UNK now it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen STOP 
START and in all UNK by now there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract STOP 
START there was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been STOP 
START she went downstairs and received another curious shock for when glendora UNK into the dining room in her UNK UNK sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and glendora said she hadn't STOP 
START too much work this morning miss sarah everybody gone like that sarah swallowed past another kind of UNK in her throat STOP 
START well then who brought it miss maude STOP 
START she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you STOP 
START glendora put down a dish of UNK rice STOP 
START not much breakfast this morning STOP 
START i don't know what we're going to do miss sarah STOP 
START we've got to eat sarah said UNK because a chill crawled over her again STOP 
START maude UNK away STOP 
START the rice wasn't UNK with opium indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt STOP 
START she ate what she could and went out along the covered UNK with the rain UNK from the UNK STOP 
START in the kitchen glendora was UNK picking chickens STOP 
START get a basket sarah told her STOP 
START we'll go to the UNK STOP 
START glendora dropped a chicken and a UNK of feathers and went with her through the UNK to the UNK STOP 
START sarah found the right key and unlocked the door STOP 
START it was a long low room like a root cellar for it was UNK up with soil and UNK had run UNK over that too STOP 
START it was dark but dry and cool STOP 
START she UNK out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas eggs UNK a little salt STOP 
START the UNK looked UNK than when miss UNK had shown her the UNK and since the men from the UNK had called were certainly now fewer UNK to feed but there was less to feed them with STOP 
START she took glendora to the UNK unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of UNK and sides of UNK hanging from the UNK UNK STOP 
START they wouldn't go hungry not yet STOP 
START and the fields were green and growing STOP 
START can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like here had said STOP 
START maude STOP 
START she sent glendora back to the house her basket and her UNK UNK STOP 
START she stood for a moment rain UNK from the trees over her head thinking of maude STOP 
START maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from UNK room STOP 
START maude had the cool UNK to do whatever she made up her mind to do STOP 
START she couldn't see how her death could affect maude STOP 
START she couldn't see any reason why maude would attempt to frighten her STOP 
START besides there was something UNK and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her STOP 
START maude was neither UNK nor silly and sarah rather UNK if she had ever been childish STOP 
START yet maude had suggested that sarah return to new york STOP 
START maude could have shot UNK if she'd had a reason to kill him STOP 
START there was no use in standing there in the UNK trying to find a link between UNK murder and opium in a cup of coffee STOP 
START she started back for the house saw a light in the office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder STOP 
START UNK george and UNK were UNK shoes STOP 
START a lighted lamp stood on the table that UNK UNK day STOP 
START they were all three bent over a UNK riding boot had a UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK held a patch of leather UNK UNK something a tiny UNK waiting for UNK poised UNK STOP 
START george said first thing i do when i get to UNK again is get me a yankee with boots on UNK laughed softly STOP 
START UNK looked up and saw her STOP 
START UNK looked up and UNK STOP 
START george didn't look up at all STOP 
START there was no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at UNK appearance believing her to be UNK and UNK and just possibly dead STOP 
START UNK said come in sarah STOP 
START UNK you know the news STOP 
START and what news sarah thought as UNK as maude might have said it STOP 
START UNK face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning STOP 
START he turned to george and UNK STOP 
START take your UNK shop somewhere else STOP 
START i want to talk to sarah STOP 
START everything in the office the spreading circle of UNK the patch of leather in UNK hands STOP 
START george poised with the UNK UNK the UNK everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt at murder STOP 
START a rush of panic caught sarah STOP 
START no STOP 
START not now STOP 
START i mean i've got to to see to the kitchen STOP 
START glendora her words UNK together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in UNK face STOP 
START now why did i do that thought as warm UNK rain touched her face STOP 
START she was no UNK UNK to bear tales STOP 
START as she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself she told anyone of the opium it must be UNK her husband STOP 
START it might be indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love but it was marriage STOP 
START so she couldn't choose UNK as a UNK must be UNK STOP 
START always provided that UNK himself had not UNK her coffee with opium she thought as UNK and sharply again as maude might have said it STOP 
START she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen where glendora was UNK the chickens UNK and maude was cleaning lamp UNK STOP 
START glendora gave a UNK STOP 
START miss sarah i can't cut up no chicken STOP 
START miss maude say she won't STOP 
START again the UNK everyday details of daily living UNK a vicious attempt to frighten her or to murder her STOP 
START the UNK everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency STOP 
START no matter what had happened or hadn't happened somebody had to see about dinner STOP 
START she UNK the chickens with if she had known it something of UNK UNK look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on latin UNK STOP

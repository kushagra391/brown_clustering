START payne UNK in madison place and handed the UNK to UNK STOP 
START there was a fog which increased the darkness of the night STOP 
START two gas UNK were no more than a UNK glow STOP 
START he might have been anywhere or nowhere STOP 
START the UNK was that he was UNK a UNK from dr. UNK STOP 
START secretary of state UNK was a sick man STOP 
START the idea had come from UNK who had once been a UNK clerk STOP 
START the sick were always receiving UNK STOP 
START no one would question such an UNK STOP 
START the bottle was filled up with UNK STOP 
START before payne UNK the old UNK UNK home where key had once been killed STOP 
START now it would have another death STOP 
START from the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the UNK STOP 
START he UNK heavily up the UNK and rang the bell STOP 
START like the bell at mass the UNK was UNK too high STOP 
START it was still good friday after all STOP 
START a nigger boy opened the door STOP 
START payne did not notice him STOP 
START he was thinking chiefly of cap STOP 
START if their UNK were to UNK there was no point in UNK time STOP 
START he pushed his way inside STOP 
START for a moment the hall confused him STOP 
START this was the largest house he had ever been in almost the largest building except for a hotel STOP 
START he had no idea where UNK room would be STOP 
START in the half darkness the UNK UNK and the hall seemed enormous STOP 
START above him somewhere were the UNK STOP 
START UNK would be up there STOP 
START he explained his UNK but without UNK much to make it UNK for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army STOP 
START he did not really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be UNK even while you watched yourself giving way to it STOP 
START he was no longer worried STOP 
START everything would be all right STOP 
START he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped STOP 
START still the sensation always surprised him STOP 
START it was a UNK he felt no part in STOP 
START he could only watch with a sort of gentle UNK while his body did these quick UNK and efficient things STOP 
START he brushed by the UNK boy and UNK heavily up the stairs STOP 
START they were UNK but made for UNK and congress UNK not the great UNK he wore STOP 
START the sound of his UNK was like a muffled drum STOP 
START at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there UNK in a dressing gown STOP 
START he stopped and whispered his UNK STOP 
START young frederick UNK held out his hand STOP 
START UNK a little payne shook his head STOP 
START dr. UNK had told him to deliver his package in person STOP 
START frederick UNK said his father was sleeping and then went through a UNK at his father's door to prove the statement STOP 
START very well payne said STOP 
START i will go STOP 
START he smiled but now that he knew where the elder UNK was he did not intend to go STOP 
START he pulled out his pistol and fired it STOP 
START it made no sound STOP 
START it had UNK STOP 
START UNK it he smashed the butt down on frederick UNK head over and over again STOP 
START it was the first blow that was always difficult STOP 
START after that violence was UNK easy STOP 
START he got caught up into it and became a different person STOP 
START only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless so that he would UNK over it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real STOP 
START the nigger boy fled down the stairs screaming murder STOP 
START it was not murder at all STOP 
START payne was more UNK than that STOP 
START he was merely clearing a way to what he had to do STOP 
START he ran for the sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away STOP 
START a knife would do STOP 
START from childhood he had known all about UNK STOP 
START someone blocked the door from inside STOP 
START he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness STOP 
START he saw only dimly moving figures but when he UNK them they yelled and fled STOP 
START he went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could repeatedly STOP 
START it was like finally getting into one's own UNK to UNK one's dreams STOP 
START two men pulled him off STOP 
START nobody said anything STOP 
START payne UNK at their arms STOP 
START there was a lady there in a UNK STOP 
START he would not have wanted to hurt a lady STOP 
START another man approached this one fully dressed STOP 
START when the knife went into his chest he went down at once STOP 
START i'm mad shouted payne as he ran out into the hall STOP 
START i'm mad and only wished he had been STOP 
START that would have made things so much easier STOP 
START but he was not mad STOP 
START he was only dreaming STOP 
START he UNK down the stairs and out of the door STOP 
START somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still UNK murder STOP 
START one always UNK up even from one's own dreams STOP 
START the UNK air UNK him STOP 
START UNK he saw had fled STOP 
START well one did not expect much of people like UNK STOP 
START he UNK his horse walked it away mounted and UNK it on STOP 
START the nigger boy was close behind him STOP 
START then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone STOP 
START he rode on and on STOP 
START he had no idea where he was STOP 
START after some time he came to an open field STOP 
START an open field was better than a building that was for sure so he UNK turned off the horse and plunged through the grass STOP 
START he felt curiously UNK the world seemed far away knew he should get to cap but he didn't know how STOP 
START he was sure for he had done as he was told hadn't he would find him and take care of him STOP 
START so choosing a good tree he UNK up into it found a comfortable UNK and curled up in it to sleep like the UNK bear he was with his hands across his chest as though UNK with honey STOP 
START violence always made him tired but he was not frightened STOP 
START in boston edwin UNK was UNK up a performance of a new way to pay old debts STOP 
START it was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more STOP 
START acting UNK him STOP 
START on a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge by the applause he must be doing it better than usual STOP 
START as sir UNK UNK how often had he had to play that part who did not believe a word of it he raised his arm and UNK where is my UNK now was one of the high spots of the play STOP 
START the audience as usual loved it STOP 
START he was delighted to see them so happy STOP 
START if he had any worries it was only the small ones about mother in new york and his daughter UNK and what she might be doing at this hour with her aunt asia in philadelphia STOP 
START everyone is UNK about his profession if he has UNK it long enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those UNK people out there who might UNK you or UNK you but that was largely though not entirely up to you STOP 
START they made the world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not STOP 
START 7 UNK was quite right about one thing STOP 
START laura UNK had been in the green room STOP 
START the UNK had brought her into the wings STOP 
START since she could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was the first person to offer mr. lincoln a glass of water holding it up to the box high above her head to miss harris who had asked for it STOP 
START she had been one of the first to collect her UNK STOP 
START it was not so much that the shot had UNK the audience as that they had been UNK already STOP 
START most of them had seen our american cousin before and unless miss UNK was on stage there was not much to it STOP 
START the theatre was hot and they were UNK with boredom STOP 
START the stage had been empty except for harry hawk doing his star UNK STOP 
START the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear in or out of character but he was not particularly funny STOP 
START at the end of the UNK the audience would UNK STOP 
START meanwhile it looked at the scenery STOP 
START well i guess i know enough to turn you inside out you UNK old UNK UNK otherwise hawk STOP 
START there was always a pause here before the next line STOP 
START that was when the gun went off STOP 
START yet even that explosion did not mean much STOP 
START guns were going off all over washington city these days because of the UNK and the theatre was not UNK STOP 
START then the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential box STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK it said UNK STOP 
START UNK had delivered his line STOP 
START behind him UNK a small UNK cloud of smoke STOP 
START they strained forward STOP 
START they had not heard what had been said STOP 
START they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily STOP 
START the figure UNK from the box almost lost its balance the flag UNK there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell on its hands and pressed itself up STOP 
START harry hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings STOP 
START his speech UNK STOP 
START he did not lower his arm STOP 
START the figure was so UNK dressed that it was as though a character from some other play had UNK into this one STOP 
START the play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the UNK STOP 
START this figure looked like the slave dealer from that STOP 
START but it also looked like a UNK UNK away from the light STOP 
START there was something UNK and crazy about its motion that disturbed them STOP 
START then it disappeared into the wings STOP 
START harry hawk had not shifted position but he at last lowered his arm STOP 
START mrs. lincoln screamed STOP 
START there was no UNK that scream STOP 
START it was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do STOP 
START yet this scream had a different note in it STOP 
START that absence of an urgent UNK UNK them awake like a UNK of water STOP 
START UNK harris one of the guests in the box stood up and demanded water STOP 
START her action was UNK STOP 
START when something unexpected happened one always asked for water if one were a woman UNK if one were a man STOP 
START mrs. lincoln screamed again STOP 
START in the presidential box someone leaned over the UNK and yelled he has shot the president got everybody up STOP 
START on the stage harry hawk began to weep STOP 
START laura UNK brushed by him with the glass of water STOP 
START the crowd began to move STOP 
START in washington city everyone lived in a bubble of UNK and one death might attract another STOP 
START it was not exactly panic they gave way to but they could not just sit there STOP 
START the UNK voices for no one could bear silence UNK out the sound of mrs. UNK UNK STOP 
START at the rear of the auditorium upstairs some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor STOP 
START it would not give STOP 
START a dr. charles UNK UNK up on the stage and got the actors to UNK him up to the box STOP 
START in the audience a man named UNK lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the UNK on the same principle which had led miss harris to demand water STOP 
START someone opened the corridor door from the inside and called for a doctor STOP 
START somehow dr. charles UNK was forced through the UNK and squeezed out into the UNK corridor STOP 
START he went straight to the presidential box STOP 
START as usual mrs. lincoln had lost her head but nobody UNK her for doing so now STOP 
START there was a little blood on the UNK of her dress for the UNK had UNK miss UNK companion major UNK with a knife STOP 
START UNK said he was bleeding to death STOP 
START by the look of him he wasn't that far gone STOP

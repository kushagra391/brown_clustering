START a man with a sketch UNK in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said is this more like it mrs. UNK are the UNK more like this he had finished with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else most probably a UNK STOP 
START begin to look like him now would you say about the mouth UNK like this maybe blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the hotel UNK and blew it off again and did the same in a tiny almost UNK room in a UNK in the west UNK STOP 
START and men also used vacuum UNK in both rooms UNK dust up once more STOP 
START men from the third detective district eighteenth UNK had the UNK the most UNK job STOP 
START at the hotel UNK there had at the time in issue been UNK UNK counting couples as singular STOP 
START these included as one mr. and mrs. anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before and had not checked out together STOP 
START but UNK UNK was not included had been at the UNK for almost a week STOP 
START there was of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel STOP 
START the UNK or UNK with the UNK themselves omitted provided merely a place to start and their identification was the UNK of starts STOP 
START with names and addresses listed UNK came next STOP 
START it would take time would almost inevitably trouble some water STOP 
START i certainly was not at the UNK last night and my husband couldn't have been STOP 
START he's in boston STOP 
START of course he's in the hotel king arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems STOP 
START the king arthur offered respectable and convenient UNK to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want heaven knew didn't want to UNK UNK through crowded streets to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations to distant homes probably through rain or in november something worse STOP 
START the king arthur was less expensive than the UNK STOP 
START the king arthur had UNK UNK again counting rooms rather than people STOP 
START check the UNK out STOP 
START failing to find what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special but not exclusive attention to those with rooms on the street STOP 
START anyone active enough can reach a roof wherever his room may be STOP 
START and know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel STOP 
START it was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel STOP 
START there were other UNK less convenient but not impossible STOP 
START it is dull business UNK and hard on feet STOP 
START there was also the one UNK question to ask and ask widely did you notice anything out of the way for example a man carrying a UNK rifle probably with a UNK sight attached was of course no hope it really would be that simple STOP 
START the UNK whether UNK UNK or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his UNK point with rifle over shoulder UNK a marching UNK STOP 
START anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle thin suitcase long fat suitcase for that matter met that from room UNK from UNK STOP 
START who measures nothing it appeared long enough to attract attention STOP 
START cases say for musical instruments noted at the UNK STOP 
START several at the king arthur STOP 
START a UNK was staying there STOP 
START and had been for a week STOP 
START anything else at all met that STOP 
START detective pearson eighteenth UNK thought for a time he might be on to something STOP 
START a refuse UNK at the UNK turned up a UNK box a very long box for very UNK flowers STOP 
START UNK of oil on green tissue UNK to check STOP 
START the UNK sorry STOP 
START no oil STOP 
START anything at all strange a man had tried at the king arthur to register with an UNK STOP 
START at the UNK a guest had come in a UNK wheel chair STOP 
START at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily UNK and another had a UNK foot and had walked with UNK STOP 
START there had also been a man who must have had st. UNK or something because he kept UNK his head STOP 
START as reports UNK in william UNK tossed them into the UNK which had become his head STOP 
START UNK came in STOP 
START there was no sign of mrs. UNK payne at her house on nod road UNK connecticut STOP 
START the house was modern large on five acres STOP 
START must have cost plenty STOP 
START the state cops would check from time to time word when there was word to pass STOP 
START UNK tossed this news into the UNK STOP 
START sort things out damn it STOP 
START sort out the next move STOP 
START try to forget motive for the moment STOP 
START consider opportunity STOP 
START only those actually with payne when he was shot or who had left the party within not more than five minutes make five arbitrary UNK had none STOP 
START the UNK UNK publicity director UNK producer of UNK STOP 
START they had been with payne when he was shot could not therefore have shot him from above STOP 
START take UNK UNK STOP 
START he had left after the UNK been seen to leave STOP 
START he would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his UNK STOP 
START consider him seriously therefore entered then UNK which felt like facts STOP 
START UNK would UNK certainly undoubtedly had STOP 
START UNK was presumably a better than average shot STOP 
START but UNK now UNK would not UNK anything which went on two legs instead of four STOP 
START because if for no other reason UNK would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger UNK than anything else that went on two legs STOP 
START UNK are laid by those who doubt themselves as any man may against a UNK STOP 
START faith UNK had had to go on from the party and had presumably gone on STOP 
START to be checked out further STOP 
START forget motive motive is a part of fact STOP 
START nobody in his right mind UNK a UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK simply do not keep that well in a UNK mind STOP 
START faith UNK had accomplished much in a quarter of a century STOP 
START UNK it now to correct so old a wrong shook his head STOP 
START also he thought i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a UNK STOP 
START UNK herself had left the party early pleading a UNK STOP 
START no lack of opportunity UNK she had a gun STOP 
START she might UNK have brought one in in a UNK suitcase STOP 
START check on the payne UNK STOP 
START she might now have taken it away again STOP 
START motive her husband UNK UNK UNK knew it happened and hell knew it too STOP 
START but it happened almost always among the primitive and usually among the very young STOP 
START call it mentally young it UNK STOP 
START there was nothing to indicate that UNK payne was primitive STOP 
START she did not move in primitive circles STOP 
START she was young but not that young STOP 
START it occurred to bill UNK that he was on a UNK basis eliminating a good many STOP 
START he reminded himself that all UNK were tentative STOP 
START he also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities STOP 
START the UNK mother or son or mother and son was obvious STOP 
START motive STOP 
START here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years STOP 
START but bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to UNK STOP 
START with the boy particularly STOP 
START the boy had apparently if mrs. UNK was right in what she had told UNK only in recent months been forced to give up college to work as a UNK STOP 
START seeing the man he UNK for this made much of youth and bitterness and bill picked up the telephone UNK STOP 
START send out a pickup on mrs. mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on bill said STOP 
START right would do STOP 
START a man named UNK UNK UNK had expressed a wish that anthony payne drop dead STOP 
START he would say of course that he had not really had any such wish what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing STOP 
START which probably would turn out to be true he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say STOP 
START a man named UNK UNK with UNK and e but pronounced without them had been fired at UNK insistence STOP 
START he was also if UNK north was right a closer UNK of UNK UNK than she now was inclined to admit STOP 
START he might deny the latter certainly deny any connection between the two things or any connection of either with murder STOP 
START he would have to be given the opportunity STOP 
START UNK was evident that UNK was the man to go STOP 
START it was evident that a captain should remain at his desk UNK with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat STOP 
START bill UNK was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack in the plaster STOP 
START let UNK keep the firm seat stein STOP 
START when UNK cats are UNK it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins STOP 
START UNK and shadow on UNK bed appeared to be one cat rather large as UNK cats go and to be sure having two heads and two UNK STOP 
START on the other hand they or it seemed to have no legs whatever STOP 
START pamela north said UNK to her cats and added that proper cats met their UNK at the door STOP 
START of four dark brown ears one UNK slightly at this STOP 
START all right UNK said STOP 
START i know it isn't UNK STOP 
START but at this the one UNK cat suddenly became two cats stretching STOP 
START shadow the more UNK began at once to talk her voice UNK STOP 
START UNK a more direct cat leaped from the bed and UNK UNK toward the kitchen STOP 
START shadow looked surprised UNK and UNK after her STOP 
START the hell it isn't UNK two waving UNK told UNK north STOP 
START it was not whatever tale was told by UNK STOP 
START UNK presumably would cope STOP 
START she might be firm STOP 
START it was most unlikely that she would be firm STOP 
START they want to be fat cats UNK thought and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a UNK and considered pulling her thoughts together STOP 
START after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble STOP 
START a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was in any event UNK STOP 
START had faith UNK explanation of her confidence so UNK been a little thin was more like a thought but not a great deal more STOP 
START had that tall dark boy carrying UNK too heavy for him found what he might have considered UNK of a man he probably hated more than he could bear possessed himself how of a rifle and killed found she had no answers only a hope STOP 
START the poor kid the poor UNK kid STOP 
START some people have luck and some have no luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of it STOP 
START the poor UNK the telephone rang STOP 
START UNK realized to her surprise that she had been almost UNK STOP 
START at four o'clock in the afternoon STOP 
START two UNK for lunch that was the trouble STOP 
START i ought to remember STOP 
START don't UNK STOP 
START you do remember STOP 
START you just UNK this is she voice had music in it STOP 
START even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the voice STOP 
START i said i would UNK said STOP 
START they won't talk about who gave the information STOP 
START not unless they have to STOP 
START they don't mrs. UNK STOP 
START not unless they have she was interrupted STOP 
START call this a cry for help faith UNK said STOP

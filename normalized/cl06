START eight nine steps above him roberts had paused STOP 
START mickey paused with him waiting no longer UNK trying now to think it out do a little planning STOP 
START he looked down over the UNK at the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set STOP 
START if i could call in they could check the story while we were on our way STOP 
START i wouldn't have to tell them i had roberts then he heard it like a muffled UNK felt a subtle change in air pressure STOP 
START he glanced up in time to see roberts UNK down on him from above literally flying through the air his UNK face twisted STOP 
START mickey tried to UNK against the UNK gripped it with one hand but roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the UNK STOP 
START he UNK for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail STOP 
START he tumbled with roberts helpless and in UNK over and over down the steps STOP 
START by a UNK effort he managed to UNK and draw in to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head STOP 
START he was UNK in his mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of the weight of roberts' body STOP 
START when his vision cleared he saw the UNK one UNK upward reaching STOP 
START mickey was on his knees when roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand STOP 
START he felt his empty pocket and knew that roberts had UNK the only weapon at hand STOP 
START UNK eyes fixed on the UNK feet which would first UNK the moment and direction of an attack STOP 
START he rose UNK forcing his knees to lock STOP 
START the UNK pain in his UNK nearly brought him down again STOP 
START he made himself back off slowly his eyes UNK on roberts who now had no more to lose than he STOP 
START the pain UNK as he moved and he UNK inside STOP 
START after a moment he extended one hand the fingers curled STOP 
START come on he said STOP 
START you want to be that big a fool i was hoping for this STOP 
START roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps STOP 
START he held the razor well out to one side STOP 
START he was UNK to attack but he could be handled mickey knew if he could be brought to make the first move STOP 
START they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared the last step STOP 
START mickey waited with UNK arms STOP 
START any time roberts he said STOP 
START or would it be easier if i put my hands in my pockets UNK was lost on roberts STOP 
START he advanced slowly directly giving no UNK of a UNK to either side STOP 
START he was just short of UNK reach when he stopped STOP 
START mickey backed off two steps forcing him to come on again STOP 
START there was a fixed grin on roberts' face made hideous by the swollen nose and the UNK blood STOP 
START mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along STOP 
START they moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts a UNK dance two steps back two steps forward two steps back STOP 
START mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy UNK front door STOP 
START this was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should UNK with a kick to the UNK the deadly hand was his exclusive concern STOP 
START the kick came sudden and vicious but short STOP 
START UNK UNK twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon STOP 
START it moved in a silver arc toward his throat then UNK downward STOP 
START he UNK his left shoulder into it and UNK at roberts' UNK with his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve STOP 
START before roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into roberts' belly STOP 
START roberts UNK and UNK at him wildly STOP 
START UNK mickey UNK and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood floor STOP 
START then roberts was on him UNK for breath and for a couple of seconds mickey lost sight of the blade STOP 
START he felt it UNK at the side of his jacket and a UNK UNK under his left ribs STOP 
START he got a knee up into roberts' belly used both hands and UNK him clear then UNK to his feet STOP 
START they were in the center of the lobby now STOP 
START still UNK the razor roberts came up into a UNK shaking his head STOP 
START when he charged mickey was ready STOP 
START he hit roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him UNK then UNK in UNK STOP 
START with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind it he smashed at the UNK face STOP 
START roberts UNK backward his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against the UNK post at the foot of the stairs STOP 
START the sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate UNK sound STOP 
START he fell on his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still STOP 
START mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands UNK for breath STOP 
START after a minute he went to roberts looked at one of his eyes and felt for a UNK STOP 
START he couldn't feel any STOP 
START roberts appeared to be dead not yet then soon very soon STOP 
START suddenly it was cold in the lobby STOP 
START 12 it seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do STOP 
START actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this there's no way to take him in now and keep those other two UNK and the one who hired the two of them from finding out about roberts and UNK out STOP 
START the local law here would hold me till they check clear back home and maybe more than that STOP 
START they would have to STOP 
START by then they could never catch up with the others STOP 
START there's no other way have to do it myself STOP 
START he looked at where roberts lay sprawled on the step STOP 
START mickey was sure now he was dead STOP 
START one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet STOP 
START only me STOP 
START he climbed the stairs went into roberts' room found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could STOP 
START he left a few things STOP 
START it didn't have to be perfect STOP 
START roberts was a UNK STOP 
START walking away on impulse he might logically leave behind what it was UNK to carry STOP 
START when he had closed the suitcase he found a UNK and moved about the room UNK carefully everything he might have touched STOP 
START it took him nearly an hour STOP 
START he went to the room he had UNK and got into his UNK STOP 
START he left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby STOP 
START he set roberts' suitcase near the front door went outside and walked back to the garage STOP 
START he was UNK surprised to find it was UNK STOP 
START it UNK softly silently an UNK UNK of his vision against the night sky STOP 
START he could feel it on his face and in his hair STOP 
START he found the key to the jeep got it started and UNK it up for five minutes STOP 
START then he backed out and swung around to the front drive STOP 
START he went into the hotel and UNK till he found the razor STOP 
START he put it in his own pocket for UNK STOP 
START he took the suitcase out to the jeep and put it in the front seat STOP 
START then he went back for roberts STOP 
START the body was heavier than he had anticipated STOP 
START he got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the jeep STOP 
START he UNK it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out then returned to the porch and closed the front door making sure it was unlocked STOP 
START he drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier STOP 
START it UNK continuously but quietly UNK STOP 
START when he reached the UNK in the woods he saw that already the earlier UNK were barely UNK STOP 
START the jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground STOP 
START he drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine STOP 
START he parked facing it and left the UNK on but when he started into the UNK with the suitcase he found the UNK extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage STOP 
START he went back and got the UNK returned to the UNK and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier STOP 
START he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it STOP 
START when the dust settled he went back to the jeep and carefully worked roberts' body onto his shoulder STOP 
START it wasn't like carrying the suitcase STOP 
START the soft snow was UNK UNK STOP 
START twice he nearly fell STOP 
START inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his UNK burden STOP 
START by the time he reached the edge of the pit he was UNK and his shoulder and back UNK under the drag of the dead weight STOP 
START he stood looking down for a few seconds then backed up two or three UNK from the edge STOP 
START there was too much weight casually to UNK it away STOP 
START he could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out STOP 
START it would be a bad place to die STOP 
START it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but roberts had asked for it STOP 
START it was too late to worry about that STOP 
START he UNK slowly and UNK the UNK onto the floor of the UNK STOP 
START it was a relief to get rid of the weight STOP 
START he was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down STOP 
START then he got on his knees and rolled roberts' body toward the edge STOP 
START it hung UNK on the point of dropping off STOP 
START he gave it a strong push heard it slide then UNK UNK into the hole STOP 
START he got to his feet and threw the UNK beam into the pit STOP 
START the body lay in an awkward UNK twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the UNK floor STOP 
START deep enough he decided STOP 
START there was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter STOP 
START the external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next day STOP 
START it wasn't cold enough in the UNK to preserve the body intact STOP 
START by spring it would be a UNK STOP 
START he made his way back to the jeep STOP 
START he had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket STOP 
START he climbed down went back into the UNK and tossed the razor into the pit STOP 
START it landed on roberts' sprawled right UNK poised UNK then slid off to the ground STOP 
START he went back once more to the jeep and started the short drive to the hotel STOP 
START in the garage he checked the jeep for signs of the use he had made of it STOP 
START there were UNK here and there and he cleaned them off using an UNK UNK he found on a UNK STOP 
START he wiped the UNK wheel and all the places he might have touched the jeep STOP 
START he replaced the UNK where it had been UNK got into his own car and backed it out of the garage STOP 
START there were tire marks where it had been but they were UNK by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny STOP 
START UNK UNK he thought might spend some time UNK for her lost lover but he UNK that she would UNK an investigation STOP 
START he judged her to be a woman of some pride though not much sense STOP 
START still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently had run away STOP

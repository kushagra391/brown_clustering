START i realized that UNK was faced with an entirely different problem but his UNK could have been no greater STOP 
START the most that was accomplished was adding mrs. UNK tray to the dish pile and by means of repeated threats on an UNK scale seeing that the girls dressed themselves after a fashion STOP 
START i was saved from making the decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly STOP 
START here's a household UNK if you can't find your children and get tired of calling them pick up the phone STOP 
START no matter if your children are at the movies in school visiting their UNK or on a field trip in some distant city they will be upon you UNK within seconds after you pick up the phone STOP 
START UNK and UNK UNK themselves around me UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK climbed onto a UNK and UNK the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency STOP 
START somehow UNK to get out a cool poised won't you hold on a second please i covered up the UNK and with more warmth and less UNK gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter including UNK island and the UNK reaches of UNK STOP 
START i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as UNK till after the call was completed STOP 
START speaking into the phone again and UNK the UNK i resumed my everyday voice STOP 
START soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like UNK holding her breath and pretending to black out UNK UNK the contents of the sugar bowl on the table and various UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START under the circumstances i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when i hung up i was reasonably certain that UNK had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it was that hank and i be there STOP 
START i discovered that the girls had UNK UNK the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living room STOP 
START it seemed that i would be the UNK if i accepted the peace and quiet instead of carrying out my threats STOP 
START UNK to get something done i started in on the dishes STOP 
START no STOP 
START i'm not saying it right STOP 
START what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink STOP 
START they looked so formidable however so demanding that i found myself staring at them in UNK and starting to UNK again this time about UNK and her husband STOP 
START how about them i thought STOP 
START UNK and herbert were among the few people we knew in UNK STOP 
START we didn't even know them till about a month after we moved at that time they had called on us after i met UNK at a UNK meeting and had taken us in hand socially STOP 
START they had been kind to us and we were UNK to them for one or two pleasant UNK and for information as to where to shop which dentist doctor UNK and sitter to call not that there was much of a choice since UNK was just a village yellow pages of the telephone book were UNK thin STOP 
START they were personalities STOP 
START UNK an expert on narrow ties thin UNK and UNK was men's fashion editor of UNK the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation STOP 
START UNK and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from UNK or was it UNK was the daughter and sole UNK of either a cattle UNK or an oil UNK and having arrived in new york with a big bank roll became a UNK in various fields STOP 
START she UNK greenwich village artists for UNK then put some money into a broadway show which was successful terrible but successful STOP 
START it was during her writing period that she and UNK met and decided that they were in love STOP 
START they were married at a UNK ceremony which was UNK recorded in UNK and all other magazines and newspapers and then they UNK in UNK STOP 
START no not UNK STOP 
START UNK was not in style that year STOP 
START they had UNK in rome was very high on rome that year STOP 
START they had bought their house in UNK after UNK all the regions of UNK surrounding new york had chosen UNK because of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names STOP 
START you are bound to get involved with people when you have children UNK had told me at our first meeting so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just UNK little UNK and dull husbands but people who do things STOP 
START i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn't escape an UNK at their way of always doing the right things STOP 
START their house was a UNK colonial which they had had restored guided by an UNK architect and UNK and added on to STOP 
START it had a UNK corner instead of a kitchen a breakfast room a luncheon room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud STOP 
START it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the UNK room paint in the painting room play with blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time STOP 
START their two boys were well adjusted and like their parents always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences STOP 
START UNK and herbert considered themselves violently UNK and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects expensive but not necessarily valuable contemporary things STOP 
START UNK UNK her independence by UNK against the UNK uniform of UNK shorts and UNK UNK by wearing UNK shorts and UNK UNK in colors UNK and UNK and vivid UNK STOP 
START sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid UNK black and with her blonde hair cut so closely wearing this uniform she strongly UNK a member of the UNK STOP 
START no one could dislike them i thought STOP 
START sometimes though they did not seem quite human STOP 
START it seemed indeed that their house was not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent enough to fill the roles UNK with nice UNK STOP 
START practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing names brand names STOP 
START you should hear the UNK in UNK voice when she said UNK or UNK or madame alexander STOP 
START she always let it be known that there was wine in the pot UNK or that the chicken had been UNK in UNK and that UNK second cousin was an intimate of theirs STOP 
START i wouldn't have wasted time UNK over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of UNK were equally UNK STOP 
START i couldn't feel at home among them STOP 
START besides UNK there was blanche STOP 
START UNK was pleasant and charming but blanche was sweet STOP 
START yes blanche was very very sweet being in her company was like being UNK in warm UNK UNK STOP 
START i had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum UNK oh my UNK has collapsed STOP 
START anyone knows how a real UNK woman would react to such a catastrophe blanche had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of doors and thrown a few little UNK things STOP 
START but dear me no blanche STOP 
START after five minutes with blanche one might welcome the UNK of UNK who was a sort of UNK UNK to UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK and UNK were UNK committee UNK and they usually managed to be elected UNK equal UNK of whatever UNK or civic project was being launched STOP 
START they were UNK not because they were fond of each other but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen UNK for social leadership STOP 
START UNK was mean quietly mean and bitterly UNK UNK STOP 
START she it was who had looked to see if i was wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn't drive STOP 
START UNK had a small UNK head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast STOP 
START she lived in an UNK house whose UNK UNK paint and even UNK were chosen to complement her UNK UNK were a couple of UNK cats STOP 
START her uniform was of rich raw silk in a shade which matched her hair skin UNK and cats and since she was so thin as to be almost UNK she rather UNK a frozen fish stick STOP 
START the husbands of these women and others i had met in UNK were distinguished only in that they were to me at least UNK STOP 
START i couldn't tell one from the other STOP 
START like herbert they were all in communications radio television magazines and advertising STOP 
START one or two were writers of books were fellows of finite charm STOP 
START each had developed a UNK UNK and the habit of saying UNK UNK to UNK STOP 
START i never thought i'd live to hear people UNK and say UNK real life STOP 
START i wouldn't have missed it for anything STOP 
START they were sincere men of the UNK UNK and the urgent smile STOP 
START these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they UNK UNK with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting STOP 
START could such UNK love for a total stranger be credited were always UNK to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses and i UNK the whole lot of them to the same degree that i UNK bake shops that called themselves UNK bake shops STOP 
START o i thought and wondered what kind of UNK such odd UNK would establish in this suburban frontier who looked like UNK UNK even at UNK conferences and who never called the school principal UNK STOP 
START i sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than UNK yearly who would give their teeth for a chance to get on person to person who thought it was nice to be important but not important to be nice were more UNK than UNK more personalities than persons STOP 
START in my UNK they were people who read UNK du UNK and discussed UNK not discussed him exactly but said UNK and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about UNK which they were because they had no opinions about UNK not having read UNK STOP 
START they were i felt people invariably trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine what not who others were STOP 
START becoming aware that it was nearly UNK i brought myself back to the tasks at hand STOP 
START i made plans for the afternoon doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once making the beds and then maybe painting the kitchen STOP 
START then i remembered that the girls had had a UNK for UNK every day for the last week STOP 
START UNK had shouted each time STOP 
START they're not UNK not even food STOP 
START they're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast STOP 
START i dug around and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a UNK cake with UNK UNK STOP 
START sometimes i think you need only one rule for cooking if you can't put UNK in it put UNK in it STOP 
START the cake was received in a UNK silence that was evidence in itself of the UNK of taste UNK mama had been providing STOP 
START then UNK closed her eyes stretched forth her arms and said take my hand UNK a stranger in paradise STOP

START such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all STOP 
START i was nearly thirty at the time STOP 
START i went to the hall in the afternoons only on these preliminary matters STOP 
START it was dark and i sensed very large the counter at one end was lighted by a long UNK tube suspended directly above it STOP 
START sometimes i was aware of people moving about in the darkness STOP 
START i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded STOP 
START a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most STOP 
START drifting here and there STOP 
START UNK as if waiting STOP 
START the UNK glow of a cigarette STOP 
START since they could see me but i not them their presence in the hall disturbed me STOP 
START the clerk paid them no attention STOP 
START this impressed me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence STOP 
START his job simply consisted in UNK new men STOP 
START when the phone rang he answered it STOP 
START his authority extended to the far edge of the counter no further STOP 
START none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him STOP 
START UNK was UNK his UNK STOP 
START he spoke to me in a UNK voice an UNK which quite UNK his personality STOP 
START he wore his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of UNK pale chest underneath STOP 
START it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was STOP 
START but it was not easy for him and he often slipped STOP 
START when one of the men in the hall behind us UNK on the floor and UNK his boot over the UNK of UNK i noticed how the clerk UNK STOP 
START i felt certain he was really a UNK little man STOP 
START his hat the cause of his UNK hung on a UNK on the wall and underneath it i could see his tie UNK ready to be slipped over his head a black UNK of UNK UNK that ought never to have left his neck STOP 
START the UNK UNK were on the counter and a UNK of UNK men's magazines STOP 
START on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio UNK permanently on a station which broadcast only UNK UNK and cheap popular music STOP 
START everything about the clerk was trivial STOP 
START once pressing him i learned that his job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall STOP 
START UNK my disappointment he attempted to UNK what UNK and UNK of authority he felt might still be UNK to his person STOP 
START with UNK i saw him assume a UNK air STOP 
START when he saw me coming he turned his radio off STOP 
START he made a show of UNK my forms on the shelf STOP 
START he would pick up the UNK phone with studied UNK then bark into it with UNK importance STOP 
START what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me STOP 
START in the UNK i was informed UNK tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall STOP 
START they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight UNK through their UNK down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office STOP 
START he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i UNK believed that he would let UNK follow words STOP 
START i was shown instead a UNK of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning STOP 
START now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand STOP 
START he couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them he said STOP 
START each of those tickets was of great value to its UNK UNK STOP 
START i UNK my hand STOP 
START later i would remember what this UNK little man had told me about the worth of a ticket STOP 
START having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to UNK concerning the hall itself STOP 
START when UNK lighted what would it look like presence of the two UNK fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air STOP 
START one afternoon upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk i had visited the toilet adjoining the hall STOP 
START by counting the number of UNK and UNK i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time STOP 
START for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended STOP 
START i could observe the two fans down at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as i had no measure of comparison STOP 
START i had for some time been hoping in UNK for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan UNK and myself STOP 
START i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not tell STOP 
START it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners UNK removed from the counter with its overhead light STOP 
START this light did not UNK very far back into the hall and my eyes were UNK rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan UNK when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or UNK on the floor below STOP 
START also the clerk appeared to UNK of my frequent curious UNK back over my shoulder STOP 
START no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention STOP 
START and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the UNK occasion when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office UNK off and on UNK STOP 
START this sort of UNK UNK UNK me STOP 
START i felt certain it was UNK STOP 
START it sprang from a type of UNK i'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here STOP 
START i decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed STOP 
START i felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance STOP 
START i lived in a state of UNK because of it STOP 
START i could not UNK to my past nor did i wish to STOP 
START i had signed it off on the forms STOP 
START my future lay solely with the hall yet what did i know about the hall at this point i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning STOP 
START i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing STOP 
START i did not despair however from it was constantly searching for UNK around the neighborhood of the hall STOP 
START though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town its character was wholly foreign to me STOP 
START large UNK UNK the street on which the hall UNK STOP 
START the river was only a few blocks away but an UNK line of UNK prevented me from seeing it STOP 
START sometimes i noticed the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK reaching above the UNK UNK STOP 
START the sounds UNK from beyond UNK UNK men shouting indicated great activity and excited me STOP 
START the hall on the other hand appeared UNK and deserted on these long UNK afternoons STOP 
START it UNK nothing i'd ever seen before STOP 
START its front was UNK but UNK in the UNK might be an indication that windows now UNK had once looked out upon the street STOP 
START i kept UNK the block hoping to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall STOP 
START but it was not a tall structure and other buildings UNK it STOP 
START for weeks i UNK about this neighborhood of UNK and UNK truck UNK and taxi repair shops gasoline UNK and UNK lunch UNK yet never did i cease to feel myself a stranger there STOP 
START i returned to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk STOP 
START as i had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application STOP 
START meanwhile spring had passed well into summer STOP 
START at last when i put it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual STOP 
START when i asked him what if anything i could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall STOP 
START i could consult this UNK on any UNK morning though not before ten o'clock STOP 
START the clerk impressed this upon me that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock STOP 
START when i went for my interview with the director i saw why STOP 
START although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people STOP 
START cigarette UNK UNK the floor STOP 
START the big fans were going drawing from the large room the UNK of UNK smoke which UNK about in pale UNK underneath the ceiling STOP 
START i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs STOP 
START the UNK itself seemed still to be UNK the heavy UNK of many men STOP 
START i stopped by the counter STOP 
START no one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office i noticed for the first time a door which had been left partially open STOP 
START past it i could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor STOP 
START the UNK office STOP 
START i UNK my UNK on the counter STOP 
START the director came to the door STOP 
START i was at once disappointed although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained STOP 
START he was a man in his late UNK with UNK hair of medium height looked UNK in a UNK summer suit brown silk tie and UNK soft collar STOP 
START he wore UNK UNK shoes somehow made me expect to see him UNK into a UNK UNK routine any moment STOP 
START but he came toward me UNK enough showed me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application STOP 
START i had the impression that he had read my forms perhaps several times STOP 
START he did not look at them now STOP 
START as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this UNK slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the UNK of the hall STOP 
START he spoke in a voice as UNK as his appearance STOP 
START why had i registered my UNK he must express his UNK over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall STOP 
START he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there my UNK qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must UNK me them STOP 
START was i sure he asked that i knew what i was applying for sort of men i would come into contact with at the hall questions did not surprise me felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle a dark and UNK place STOP 
START though i UNK that he would understand me i told the director my motives for applying STOP 
START i had always i said UNK after working hard with my hands STOP 
START this desire i went on growing UNK as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual UNK STOP 
START to this effect i had already UNK all connections which bound me to my former existence STOP

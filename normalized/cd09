START few persons who join the church are UNK STOP 
START they earnestly desire to do the will of god STOP 
START when they fall by the UNK and fail to achieve christian stature it is an indictment of the church STOP 
START these UNK are dramatic evidence of halfway UNK a failure to follow through STOP 
START a program of lay UNK UNK can end in UNK defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship STOP 
START the work of lay UNK UNK is not completed when all of the persons on the responsibility list have been interviewed STOP 
START in the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to christ and the church STOP 
START the pastor and the membership preparation and UNK committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program STOP 
START the first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the church STOP 
START neglect means spiritual UNK or death STOP 
START preparation for membership churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and UNK often keep UNK to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active STOP 
START this is the answer to the problem of membership UNK STOP 
START it is important that persons UNK to UNK with the church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and UNK significant STOP 
START it is unfair and UNK to ask a person to take the sacred UNK of church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications STOP 
START preparation for church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received STOP 
START 1 the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual expressing his joy over the decision UNK him of a UNK call at the earliest convenient time and UNK the plan for membership preparation classes and membership sunday STOP 
START some UNK write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors STOP 
START it should not be UNK later than the next day STOP 
START a helpful UNK may be enclosed in the letter STOP 
START 2 the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference STOP 
START if possible he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present STOP 
START this is not a social call STOP 
START it is definitely a spiritual guidance conference STOP 
START he will discuss the significance of christian commitment the necessity of family religion and private UNK and the importance of the membership preparation sessions STOP 
START there may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel STOP 
START each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer STOP 
START a piece of UNK material such as the upper room may be left in each home STOP 
START 3 a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults STOP 
START some churches require more STOP 
START none should ask less STOP 
START those who join the church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of christian UNK before they take the sacred UNK STOP 
START they will have a greater appreciation for the church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them STOP 
START many churches find the sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes STOP 
START others meet on sunday night at the UNK service or for a series of four nights STOP 
START some UNK have two sessions in one evening with a UNK period between STOP 
START the sessions should cover four major areas a the christian faith history of the church duties of church membership the local church and its program STOP 
START following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the UNK should be handed each one for further reading during the week STOP 
START this procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership UNK STOP 
START fourth session important most UNK find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to reception sunday STOP 
START in this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the UNK as well as the program and activities of the local church STOP 
START the lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life service opportunities the church school missions men's work women's work youth program social activities and UNK STOP 
START the budget of the church may be presented and UNK UNK at this session STOP 
START an interest UNK or talent sheet may be filled out by each person STOP 
START see sample on UNK UNK STOP 
START the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and UNK STOP 
START the social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members STOP 
START additional suggestions for membership preparation in conducting the membership UNK class the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class STOP 
START the following have been found effective STOP 
START 1 extend the number of classes STOP 
START some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each generally held on sunday night or during the week STOP 
START this gives greater opportunity for the learning process STOP 
START 2 use UNK for example in discussing the lord's supper or church UNK STOP 
START 3 use UNK aids STOP 
START some excellent UNK with UNK and motion pictures may be secured from your UNK headquarters to UNK the class session STOP 
START 4 have a question box STOP 
START some new members will UNK to ask questions UNK STOP 
START urge them to write out their questions for the box STOP 
START 5 use a UNK with assigned readings each week STOP 
START 6 select class members for reports on various phases of the study STOP 
START 7 conduct UNK using a UNK check sheet STOP 
START 8 ask each member to write a statement on such UNK as what christ means to me what the church means to me why join the church the duties of church members etc. STOP 
START 9 assign a series of UNK questions to be UNK STOP 
START 10 invite class members to share in an extra period of bible study each week STOP 
START 11 ask each new member to bring his UNK of loyalty to the reception service STOP 
START what about transfers is a growing conviction among UNK and church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the church need UNK training including those coming by transfer of membership STOP 
START george e. UNK writes there is danger in trying to make admission to the church so easy and UNK that people will scarcely know that anything has happened STOP 
START people appreciate experiences that demand something of them STOP 
START those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule STOP 
START for most of them it will be their first experience in membership training since this is a recent development in many churches STOP 
START those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed STOP 
START the UNK class is an UNK UNK group in which new members become acquainted with one another STOP 
START it provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations STOP 
START reception into the church fellowship the total process of UNK reaches the UNK when the group of new members stands before the congregation to UNK publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the church STOP 
START this should be a high moment in their lives a UNK experience STOP 
START they should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to christ our lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the UNK of the ages STOP 
START every detail of the service merits careful attention the UNK the sermon the ritual the right hand of fellowship the introduction to the congregation the welcome of the congregation STOP 
START this is a vital part of their spiritual growth and UNK STOP 
START it will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the church STOP 
START it can mean the difference between participation and UNK spiritual growth and decay STOP 
START the worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the church STOP 
START the atmosphere for this UNK experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience STOP 
START UNK the reception should be the climax following the sermon STOP 
START 1 ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and UNK cards STOP 
START some denominations ask new members to sign personally the UNK membership register STOP 
START provide a name card for each new member STOP 
START outline plans for the entire service STOP 
START 2 UNK a reserved section in the UNK where all new members may sit together STOP 
START UNK may sit with them also STOP 
START 3 invite UNK or fellowship friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service STOP 
START 4 give each new member a UNK of membership STOP 
START 5 introduce each new member to the congregation asking him to face the congregation STOP 
START 6 lead the congregation in a response of welcome STOP 
START 7 have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service STOP 
START 8 take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board STOP 
START 9 have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests STOP 
START chapter 6 planning for the UNK and growth of new members the church is the family of god STOP 
START the members of the family are drawn together by a common love for christ and a sincere devotion to his kingdom STOP 
START every member of the family must have a vital place in its life STOP 
START this is no UNK experience is to be a UNK STOP 
START yet the most difficult problem in the UNK program of UNK is right at this point helping new members to become participating growing parts of the fellowship STOP 
START very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the UNK and UNK STOP 
START a study of major UNK membership statistics over a UNK period revealed the UNK fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the church were lost to the church within seven years STOP 
START one UNK had a membership of UNK at the beginning of the period under study and twenty years later its membership stood at UNK a net growth of only UNK STOP 
START yet during the same period there were UNK UNK STOP 
START another major church body had UNK members and twenty years later its membership stood at UNK STOP 
START during this time UNK new members were brought into the fellowship STOP 
START still another UNK had UNK members twenty years ago STOP 
START during this period UNK members were received yet the net membership now is only UNK STOP 
START these figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership STOP 
START this problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship STOP 
START studies of membership trends even in some areas where population is expanding show that numbers of churches have had little net increase though many new members were received STOP 
START something is wrong when these things happen STOP 
START the local family of god has failed its new members through neglect and UNK for their spiritual welfare STOP 
START basic needs new members can become participating growing members STOP 
START but this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life STOP 
START it must be planned and carefully developed STOP 
START the entire membership of the local church must be UNK to their part in this dynamic process STOP 
START if the church has followed the plan of UNK of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as UNK earlier in this book the process of UNK and growth will be well under way STOP 
START those who enter the front door of the church UNK and with christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest STOP 
START however it is not enough to bring persons to christian commitment and train them in the meaning of christian UNK STOP 
START when they UNK with the church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective christians STOP 
START the church expects certain things of those who become members STOP 
START the new members UNK expect some things from their church family welcome into the fellowship sincere christian love and understanding UNK and challenging worship experiences social and UNK activities opportunities for christian service opportunities for study of the christian faith and the bible creative prayer experiences guidance in christian social concerns STOP

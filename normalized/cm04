START ryan UNK his bulk up and supported it on one UNK STOP 
START he rubbed his eyes UNK with one huge UNK STOP 
START ekstrohm UNK you guys okay nothing wrong with me that couldn't be UNK UNK said STOP 
START he didn't say what would cure him had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself STOP 
START his small black eyes UNK inside the UNK UNK of his face STOP 
START ekstrohm insisted STOP 
START okay STOP 
START well let's take a UNK look at the country around here STOP 
START the UNK rolled open on the landscape STOP 
START a range of UNK UNK the horizon the color of UNK UNK STOP 
START above them the sky was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above UNK seen against UNK snow STOP 
START that cold empty sky was full of fire and light STOP 
START it seemed almost a UNK of the UNK itself of the UNK way UNK up by some master UNK STOP 
START this UNK UNK was actually only a belt of minor planets almost like the UNK belt in the original solar system STOP 
START these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere STOP 
START but to the UNK of scientists for no known reason not all of them did STOP 
START this would be the fifth UNK expedition to the UNK of UNK in three generations STOP 
START they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered much like the continent of UNK in ancient history STOP 
START how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely asked STOP 
START he was the captain so he could ask questions like that STOP 
START some can be lonely in a crowd UNK said UNK STOP 
START what will we need outside ryan asked STOP 
START no UNK the captain answered STOP 
START we can UNK out there all right STOP 
START it just won't be easy STOP 
START this old world lost all of its helium and trace UNK long ago STOP 
START nitrogen and oxygen are about it STOP 
START ryan look over there UNK said STOP 
START animals STOP 
START UNK the ship STOP 
START think they're intelligent maybe hostile i think they're dead ekstrohm UNK quietly STOP 
START i get no readings from them at all STOP 
START UNK electronic UNK all blank STOP 
START according to these UNK they're stone dead STOP 
START ekstrohm you and i will have a look ryan said STOP 
START you hold down the fort UNK STOP 
START take it easy STOP 
START easy UNK confirmed STOP 
START i heard a story once about a UNK who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an UNK reading on him STOP 
START me i know the mind of an officer works in a strange and UNK manner STOP 
START i'm not worried about you UNK the UNK UNK just about a UNK like you reading them at all STOP 
START remember when the little hand is straight up that's negative STOP 
START positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark STOP 
START but i'm UNK STOP 
START ryan told him what he could do then STOP 
START ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the UNK with only a glance at the UNK gauge on his UNK STOP 
START the strong negative field his suit set up would help to UNK UNK and insects STOP 
START actually the types of UNK that could attack a UNK UNK were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories STOP 
START he wasn't likely to come down with hot UNK and UNK UNK fever STOP 
START they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only a glance at the UNK gauge to judge surface resistance dropped to the ground STOP 
START it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow STOP 
START they walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the UNK sprawled on its side STOP 
START ekstrohm UNK it with a boot STOP 
START hey this is pretty close to a UNK STOP 
START UNK ryan admitted STOP 
START one of the best matches i've ever found STOP 
START well it has to happen STOP 
START statistical average and all STOP 
START still it sometimes gives you a UNK feeling to find a rabbit or a UNK UNK on some strange world STOP 
START it makes you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke and somebody has been everywhere before you even started STOP 
START the UNK looked UNK at the captain STOP 
START the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts STOP 
START ekstrohm cleared his throat STOP 
START what shall we do with this one it UNK it with his UNK following UNK example STOP 
START i don't know UNK STOP 
START it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me STOP 
START no hands for one thing STOP 
START of course that's not definite proof STOP 
START no it isn't ekstrohm said STOP 
START i think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the UNK UNK around here STOP 
START in the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead UNK represent STOP 
START what killed them it looks like we did when we made UNK STOP 
START but what about our landing was UNK to the creatures radiation suggested STOP 
START the planet is very low in radiation from mineral UNK and the atmosphere seems to UNK out most of the solar output STOP 
START any little dose of radiation might knock off these UNK STOP 
START i don't know about that STOP 
START maybe it would work the other way STOP 
START maybe because they have had virtually no UNK exposure and don't have any UNK stored up they could take a lot without harm STOP 
START then maybe it was the UNK we set up STOP 
START or maybe it's sheer UNK STOP 
START they UNK up and die at the sight of something strange and alien like a UNK STOP 
START maybe the captain admitted STOP 
START at this stage of the game anything could be possible STOP 
START but there's one possibility i particularly don't like STOP 
START and that is suppose it was not us that killed these UNK STOP 
START suppose it is something right on the planet native to it STOP 
START i just hope it doesn't work on UNK too STOP 
START these UNK went real sudden STOP 
START ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet STOP 
START the UNK made camp outside the UNK STOP 
START there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out STOP 
START the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles UNK with a UNK UNK to alert the UNK to the approach of any being STOP 
START each man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced UNK on board the ship STOP 
START ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on UNK UNK STOP 
START there was a UNK of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground STOP 
START insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to UNK and UNK in the morning sun STOP 
START the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration UNK on board STOP 
START yet he knew the others were sleeping more UNK now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had UNK them to send them riding high vacuum STOP 
START ekstrohm was not asleep STOP 
START now there could be an end to pretending STOP 
START he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor STOP 
START ekstrohm stood up STOP 
START there was no longer any need to hide STOP 
START but what was there to do had changed for him no longer had to lie in his bunk all night his eyes closed pretending to sleep STOP 
START in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read STOP 
START it was small comfort for UNK STOP 
START ekstrohm never slept STOP 
START some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this STOP 
START actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and UNK that he forgot STOP 
START others admitted he was absolutely correct he never slept STOP 
START his body processes only slowed down enough for him to UNK fatigue UNK STOP 
START occasionally he fell into a waking UNK UNK he never slept STOP 
START never at all STOP 
START naturally he couldn't let his UNK know this STOP 
START UNK would ground him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological grounds STOP 
START he had to hide it STOP 
START over the years he had had UNK in space in whom he thought he could UNK STOP 
START the UNK invariably took advantage of him STOP 
START since he couldn't sleep anyway he might as well stand their UNK for them or write their reports STOP 
START where the hell did he get off threatening to report any UNK on their part to the captain man with UNK had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him STOP 
START ekstrohm had to hide his secret STOP 
START in a camp instead of UNK hiding the secret was easier STOP 
START but the secret itself was just as hard STOP 
START ekstrohm picked up a UNK UNK from the UNK library a book by UNK the famous twentieth century expert on sex STOP 
START he UNK a few lines on the social UNK of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the UNK UNK UNK style STOP 
START on impulse he UNK up the heat control on his UNK and slid back the UNK of the bubble STOP 
START ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the UNK UNK UNK the frozen UNK of the thin air STOP 
START behind him his UNK stirred without waking STOP 
START ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a UNK on the UNK of his bubble STOP 
START it took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting UNK STOP 
START the angry UNK face of ryan greeted him STOP 
START okay UNK this isn't the place for fun and games STOP 
START what did you do with them do with what the dead UNK STOP 
START all the dead animals laying around the ship STOP 
START what are you talking about ryan do you think i did with them i don't know STOP 
START all i know is that they are gone STOP 
START gone UNK his way outside and UNK the UNK STOP 
START there was no ring of animal UNK STOP 
START nothing STOP 
START nothing but UNK grass UNK in the keen breeze STOP 
START i'll be damned ekstrohm said STOP 
START you are right now buddy STOP 
START UNK doesn't like anybody UNK up primary evidence STOP 
START where do you get off ryan demanded STOP 
START why pick me for your UNK has got to be some kind of local phenomenon STOP 
START why UNK a UNK of being behind this listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt STOP 
START but you aren't exactly the model of a UNK you know STOP 
START you've been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that STOP 
START no ekstrohm said no i didn't know that STOP 
START you've been hiding things from me and UNK every jump we've made with you STOP 
START now comes this fits the pattern of UNK and UNK you've been involved in STOP 
START what could i do with your lousy dead bodies would i want with them all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night and you were the only UNK being who came in or out of our alarm UNK STOP 
START the UNK show that STOP 
START now all the bodies are missing like they got up and walked away STOP 
START it was not a new experience to ekstrohm STOP 
START no STOP 
START suspicion wasn't new to him at all STOP 
START ryan there are other explanations for the UNK of the bodies STOP 
START look for them will you give you my word i'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately UNK up the expedition STOP 
START take my word can't you shook his head STOP 
START i don't think i can STOP 
START there's still such a thing as mental illness STOP 
START you may not be responsible STOP 
START ekstrohm UNK STOP 
START don't try anything violent UNK STOP 
START i UNK you fifty pounds and i'm fast for a big man STOP 
START i wasn't planning on UNK you STOP 
START why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong STOP

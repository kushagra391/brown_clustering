START you have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the congress he has seen the UNK and the UNK and the UNK the UNK and UNK and UNK come and go and that we are passing on to them the UNK nation that mankind has ever known STOP 
START then i have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people STOP 
START so i say mr. speaker god UNK you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the united states of america and the free world STOP 
START you remember the words of president kennedy a week or so ago when someone asked him when he was in canada and dean UNK was in europe and vice president johnson was in asia who is running the store he said the same fellow who has been running it sam rayburn STOP 
START general leave to extend mr. UNK STOP 
START mr. speaker i ask UNK consent that all members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks STOP 
START the speaker pro UNK STOP 
START UNK there objection to the request of the gentleman from massachusetts was no objection STOP 
START remarks of UNK joseph p. UNK of new york mr. UNK STOP 
START -hlit is notably significant that so many members from both sides of the UNK express their respect and UNK for our beloved speaker the honorable sam rayburn STOP 
START i UNK UNK from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the state of texas STOP 
START i did so because i agree with so many here today that he is the beloved speaker of all the people of the united states STOP 
START for the dignity the influence and the power of the legislative branch of our government it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country STOP 
START to honor him is to honor ourselves STOP 
START in this my first year as a member of this body i have experienced many memorable moments STOP 
START many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me STOP 
START and like many of you here present i hold as the UNK of all the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable speaker of the house STOP 
START at that time he afforded me the UNK of his busy UNK for such length as i may need to speak about my background my hopes my views on various national and local UNK and any problems that i may have been UNK with at the time STOP 
START he was UNK in his handling of all subjects with me and UNK wise in his counsel STOP 
START in conclusion he wished me well and as UNK and UNK as this UNK gentleman could express himself he asked to be remembered to my wife and children STOP 
START in my short period here i believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the UNK STOP 
START he is most effective in the ordinary business of the house and in the legislative UNK of this session he easily rose to great occasion even at the height of UNK and exciting legislative struggle and as the nation witnessed these UNK he rose even as admitted by those who differed with him to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan STOP 
START i am highly UNK today to UNK the brilliant career of this UNK giant STOP 
START he will ever be my example as a true statesman who is thoroughly human who affects no dignity and who is UNK with real ability genuine worth and UNK UNK all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long STOP 
START may the divine speaker in heaven UNK this country with sam UNK continued service here for years to come STOP 
START remarks of UNK wayne l. UNK of ohio mr. UNK STOP 
START -hlit is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this UNK of praise respect and affection for speaker sam rayburn STOP 
START in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the UNK force that he represents in current american government is an almost indispensable source of strength STOP 
START he has become in this half century the grand old man of american history STOP 
START it seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to providence that sam UNK vigor and his life remain UNK through the coming decades STOP 
START here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and UNK UNK that would define the immense service of this UNK to his country STOP 
START but the task is beyond me because i hold it impossible to UNK in a sentence or two the complicated and UNK contributions sam rayburn has made as an individual as a UNK as a statesman and as a leader and UNK to the UNK progress of this nation STOP 
START it happens that i am a UNK from ohio and that i feel deeply about the needs the aspirations the interests of my district and my state STOP 
START what sam UNK life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can UNK and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly UNK interests of one's own community one's own district one's own state and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time STOP 
START for sam rayburn never forgot UNK his home community and he never forgot texas STOP 
START in the same way i like to think we UNK our loyalty as legislators to our community our district our state STOP 
START and if we follow the rayburn pattern as consciously or by an UNK political sense i like to think i have followed it then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country STOP 
START for what sam UNK life in this house teaches us is that loyalty and character are not UNK and there is no such thing as being for your country and UNK your district STOP 
START there is no such thing as being UNK about national affairs but indifferent about home needs STOP 
START the two are as one STOP 
START this may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson sam UNK career up to this hour teaches all of us who would UNK to distinction in political life under our processes of government STOP 
START more than that sam rayburn is the very living symbol of an UNK UNK so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition STOP 
START through the most UNK UNK of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character UNK as an example of dignity and UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START sam rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most UNK UNK and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a UNK under fire or his political manners in the heat of UNK ambitions STOP 
START this means much to the american tradition STOP 
START it is an answer in its way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics STOP 
START and the name rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for the last half century STOP 
START it is i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated and because it goes so deep STOP 
START but this we know here is a great life that in every area of american politics gives the american people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor UNK and UNK STOP 
START i pray to god that he may be UNK to us for many years to come for this is an influence the united states and the whole world can ill afford to lose STOP 
START remarks of UNK UNK price of illinois mr. price STOP 
START UNK but two of my nine terms in the house of representatives has been served under the UNK of sam rayburn STOP 
START of this i am proud STOP 
START i have a distinct UNK for this man we honor today because of the UNK with which he carries his greatness STOP 
START and sam rayburn is a great man one who will go down in american history as a truly great leader of the nation STOP 
START he will be considered not only great among his UNK but as great among all the americans who have played a part in the country's history since the beginning STOP 
START i pay my personal tribute to sam rayburn UNK UNK and great american not only because today he UNK a record of having served as speaker of the house of representatives more than twice as long as henry clay but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the nation during his almost half century of service as a member of congress STOP 
START speaker rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the house in the UNK chair STOP 
START he had an outstanding record as a UNK since the start of his career in the house in 1913 the UNK congress STOP 
START no one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has sam rayburn STOP 
START he is the recognized father of the rural UNK administration and the security and exchange commission STOP 
START but to run the UNK of the programs sam rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today's record STOP 
START no greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this house than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great UNK this great UNK this great american STOP 
START my sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today STOP 
START remarks of UNK john s. UNK of connecticut mr. UNK STOP 
START sam rayburn is one of the greatest american public figures in the history of our country and i consider that i have been UNK honored in the privilege of knowing sam rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a member of the house of representatives in the congress of the united states STOP 
START others may speak of speaker UNK UNK long and devoted service his UNK of many of the progressive social measures which UNK our statute books today and of his cooperation in times of UNK with presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the ship of state through the UNK of today's UNK international UNK STOP 
START i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution STOP 
START although sam rayburn affects a UNK UNK in many instances nevertheless he is UNK a man of warm heart and gentle disposition STOP 
START no one could be more devoted than he to the american congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world and i shall never forget his moving talks delivered in simple yet eloquent words upon the meaning of our jobs as representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today's assault upon popular government STOP 
START above all he is a person to whom a UNK representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably UNK a new congressman STOP 
START in this role of father UNK he has always been most characteristic and most helpful STOP 
START on september 16 sam rayburn will have served as speaker twice as long as any UNK and i am proud to join with others in marking this date and in expressing my UNK for that notable american sam rayburn STOP

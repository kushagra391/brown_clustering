START a royal UNK issued in 1910 two years after the belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the congo prescribed the registration of all adult males by UNK STOP 
START further UNK along this line were issued in UNK and UNK STOP 
START in UNK a continuous registration of the whole UNK population was instituted by UNK of the UNK and the UNK UNK of these records was ordered STOP 
START but specific procedures for carrying out this plan were left to the discretion of the UNK UNK STOP 
START a unified set of regulations applicable to all areas was issued in UNK and a UNK series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at the same time STOP 
START the whole system was again reviewed and UNK in UNK STOP 
START general responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs service UNK UNK UNK et de la UNK UNK af direction af direction UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK authorities the UNK and their UNK were held responsible for maintaining the UNK of UNK persons within their UNK under the general supervision of district officials STOP 
START the district officials along with their other duties were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to UNK the annual UNK of demographic statistics STOP 
START the regulations require the UNK of each individual male or female adult or child on a separate card UNK STOP 
START the cards filed by UNK UNK or village are kept in the headquarters of each UNK UNK STOP 
START each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned including his or her date of birth or age at a specified time UNK and children STOP 
START additional entries must be made from time to time STOP 
START different cards are used for males and females and a corner is UNK from the cards of adults and of children when they reach UNK STOP 
START so a quick count could be made at any time even by an UNK clerk of the number of registered persons in four UNK classes STOP 
START personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments UNK periods of employment and changes of residence are recorded STOP 
START similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females STOP 
START each adult is held personally responsible for UNK his UNK and UNK an identification card which must be shown on demand STOP 
START the registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons STOP 
START the cards of permanent UNK are in theory sent to an office in the place of new residence STOP 
START finally the registration of UNK and UNK by nearest relatives was made UNK in most regions STOP 
START numbers of registered persons in four UNK classes were counted each year STOP 
START in addition demographic inquiries supposedly involving field investigations were conducted in selected minor divisions UNK containing about 3 percent of the total population STOP 
START the results of these inquiries were used to adjust UNK of data from the UNK and to provide various ratios and rates by districts including birth and death rates general UNK rates UNK by UNK status UNK of wives separately in UNK and UNK UNK infant UNK and UNK STOP 
START the areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials supposedly as representative of a larger population STOP 
START UNK of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas were applied to the larger population STOP 
START the scheme in theory is an UNK UNK of european registration systems to the conditions of african life STOP 
START but it places a severe strain on the administrative resources already UNK in other ways of a widely UNK poor and largely UNK population STOP 
START the sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies STOP 
START the system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban centers STOP 
START the distinction between UNK de UNK and present de UNK population was not clearly defined STOP 
START so the results are subject to considerable confusion STOP 
START the system tended to break down during the war but was UNK had reached the UNK level of efficiency by 1951 STOP 
START in spite of the defects in this system the figures on total population during the late UNK and again in the early UNK seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate UNK STOP 
START but the information on the UNK of population was often quite UNK STOP 
START the same system with minor UNK was developed in UNK under belgian administration STOP 
START here again it seems that useful UNK of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in this way in the late UNK and early UNK periods STOP 
START before considering more recent activities we should note another important aspect of UNK in belgian africa STOP 
START a number of strong independent agencies established in some cases with governmental or royal support have conducted large medical social educational and research operations in particular parts of the congo and UNK STOP 
START the work of UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK du congo UNK UNK has special interest with respect to UNK STOP 
START this agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from UNK persons in 1941 to UNK in 1956 in the UNK district and adjacent areas east of UNK STOP 
START each year from 1941 on its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and as its primary objective the UNK of major diseases STOP 
START its findings are reported each year in its UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical officers in other areas STOP 
START other independent or partially independent agencies have promoted investigations on UNK directly or indirectly related to UNK STOP 
START these studies vary widely in scope and precision STOP 
START UNK UNK la UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK has sponsored UNK field investigations and has UNK closely with the government of UNK in the development of its official statistics STOP 
START a massive investigation of the characteristics of UNK and prospective UNK in UNK is being carried on by j. j. UNK former director of the social science branch of UNK now a professor at UNK UNK du congo UNK et du UNK STOP 
START some UNK completed UNK with 20 items collected by UNK in UNK UNK have been UNK STOP 
START the results are now being analyzed STOP 
START statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in UNK during the UNK years in connection with long-term economic and social programs STOP 
START the UNK organizations of both countries which maintain administrative services throughout the UNK retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information STOP 
START however the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics STOP 
START a bureau de la UNK a. UNK director was formed under UNK in the congo to work in close UNK with the section UNK of the UNK general STOP 
START eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the congo was transferred to the demographic division of the central statistical office STOP 
START the 1952 demographic inquiry in UNK was directed by v. UNK a member of the UNK staff though the inquiry was carried out under the UNK of UNK which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory STOP 
START a member of the UNK staff e. van de UNK was recently UNK to cooperate with UNK in the development of demographic statistics in this territory STOP 
START the UNK of sampling UNK in UNK 1952 and in the congo 1955 UNK were major advances STOP 
START we will deal first with the program in the congo though this was put into operation later than the other STOP 
START the radical nature of the UNK in the congo was not emphasized in the official UNK STOP 
START the term UNK UNK previously used for the UNK investigations carried out in connection with the administrative UNK was used for the new investigations STOP 
START however the differences in procedure are fundamental STOP 
START these are as follows 1 field work procedures STOP 
START UNK operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to UNK trained teams of full-time african investigators three teams each working in two provinces STOP 
START these teams carried out the same operations UNK in different areas STOP 
START 2 nature of the sample STOP 
START UNK areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability theory so as to be representative of the total population of defined areas within UNK limits STOP 
START in short scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective sampling STOP 
START the UNK of the various districts or other major divisions were UNK by type of community rural urban mixed and where appropriate by ethnic UNK and by type of economy STOP 
START sample units villages in rural areas houses in cities were drawn UNK within these UNK STOP 
START 3 size of the sample STOP 
START UNK sampling ratios were applied under different conditions STOP 
START higher proportions were UNK in urban and mixed communities than in rural areas STOP 
START about 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries STOP 
START 4 questions and UNK STOP 
START UNK questions UNK and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country STOP 
START data were obtained separately on three classes of persons a residents present b residents absent c visitors STOP 
START in the reports summary results are given for both the de UNK a and c and de UNK a and b UNK the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de UNK population or in some districts only the de UNK population STOP 
START these changes represent in effect a shift from 1 an administrative UNK of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to 2 a systematic sampling census of the whole african population STOP 
START the population registration system still has important functions STOP 
START it supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in particular situations STOP 
START it provides a frame for the sampling census STOP 
START it also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the congo from this source in the near future STOP 
START it is still used in making current population estimates in UNK years though the value of these estimates is open to question STOP 
START finally it may have certain very important less obvious values STOP 
START even though the UNK may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no longer living there they contain precise information on ages by date of birth for some of the persons present especially children in relatively stable communities and UNK information such as records of UNK status for many others STOP 
START the quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries STOP 
START furthermore it may be possible to estimate the error due to UNK in method as distinguished from sampling error in each of these sources on such subjects as UNK UNK and UNK during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction STOP 
START the first sampling census in the congo extended over a UNK period 1955 UNK results were still being processed in 1959 STOP 
START it is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 so that the inquiry can be carried through in one year and the results published more UNK STOP 
START it is proposed that in the future complete sampling UNK be carried out at UNK intervals STOP 
START reports already issued on the sampling census 1955 UNK in various areas run as follows using only the french and UNK corresponding UNK titles STOP 
START this report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables STOP 
START other reports in identical form but with somewhat varying content have been issued STOP 
START these area reports will be followed according to present plans by a summary report which will include a detailed statement on methods STOP

START if the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be UNK of the people and this it must not be forgotten is one of the goals of the UNK theological task there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation STOP 
START this does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching STOP 
START the absurd notion that UNK UNK the UNK of all mythological concepts completely UNK UNK intention STOP 
START his point is not that UNK may not be used but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate UNK for expressing the christian UNK STOP 
START when we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for UNK the christian understanding of existence STOP 
START mythological concepts may by all means still be used but they can be used UNK only as symbols or UNK that is only if they are also constantly interpreted in UNK or UNK terms STOP 
START the statement is often made that when UNK UNK in this way he UNK the intellectual UNK which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the christian faith STOP 
START but this statement is completely UNK STOP 
START if UNK own definition of myth is strictly UNK to and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such UNK the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all UNK the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant STOP 
START nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are UNK almost entirely UNK and so UNK UNK from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been UNK STOP 
START on the contrary even in the heart of the bible belt itself as can be UNK by any one who is called to work there the industrial and technological UNK have long been under way together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world STOP 
START in fact it is in just such a situation that the UNK of UNK argument is disclosed STOP 
START although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more UNK situation the striking thing is the UNK with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence STOP 
START this is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class STOP 
START time and again in UNK and teaching one UNK members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the UNK UNK of their UNK heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious STOP 
START the same thing is also evidenced by the extreme UNK so often observed to UNK the preaching and teaching of the american churches STOP 
START in the absence of a truly adequate UNK in which the gospel can be expressed the UNK need to UNK it makes use of whatever resources are at hand and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation STOP 
START this is not to say that the only explanation of the present UNK with norman vincent UNK cult of UNK or the other types of a purely cultural christianity is the UNK need for a UNK gospel STOP 
START but it is to say that this need is far more important for such UNK than most of the UNK seem to have suspected STOP 
START however even if the UNK demand for UNK is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming at least among the UNK elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace STOP 
START to be sure when this is pointed out a common response among certain UNK is to UNK about the little UNK and the great crowd and to take UNK from UNK UNK of the wisdom of the wise in the opening chapter of first UNK STOP 
START but can we any longer afford the luxury of such UNK UNK the church risk assuming that the UNK of men is as dear to god as their wisdom or as is also commonly implied that the UNK of god and the UNK of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing we continue to UNK precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly UNK is an ancient and UNK tradition in the church which UNK however from the heritage of the UNK rather than from the bible that god is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for UNK his work in the world STOP 
START by analogy the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church STOP 
START but as UNK everywhere UNK us god does have need of his creatures and the church a UNK can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world by god's providence presents it STOP 
START and yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume as we too often do that we can continue to UNK the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to UNK men STOP 
START until we translate this gospel into a language that UNK men today can understand we are UNK ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends STOP 
START in UNK in this way we are obviously taking for granted that a UNK UNK of the UNK can be achieved that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction STOP 
START but the main point here is that even if such a UNK were not possible the demand to UNK the UNK would still be UNK STOP 
START this is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition STOP 
START if to be a christian means to say yes where i otherwise say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then my only choice is to refuse to be a christian STOP 
START expressed differently if the price for becoming a faithful UNK of jesus christ is some form of UNK whether of the body or of the mind UNK UNK UNK UNK then there is no alternative but that the price remain UNK STOP 
START this must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this UNK chapter STOP 
START modern man as UNK UNK has told us has come of age though this process by no means represents an UNK gain and is in fact marked by the UNK from the depths that seems to be the cost of human UNK it is still a positive step forward those of us who so UNK benefit from it should be the last to UNK it STOP 
START in any event it is an UNK step and if we are at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god has seen fit to place us STOP 
START to say this of course is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years or at any rate since the beginning of the UNK modern period in theological thought STOP 
START we have UNK ourselves with that liberal tradition in protestant christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK and more recently UNK and the early UNK and in part at least UNK STOP 
START it is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of american theology also belong STOP 
START for we must number here not only the names of UNK UNK and UNK not to mention those of the chicago school and UNK but those of the brothers UNK and if america may claim him UNK as well STOP 
START finally we may also mention the several members of the UNK UNK movement that developed at the university of chicago and is heavily UNK UNK to the creative work of alfred north UNK STOP 
START what makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been UNK in earnest about being modern men in a UNK modern world STOP 
START although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the UNK church they have UNK no willingness whatever to sacrifice their UNK to their christianity STOP 
START they have insisted rather on living fully and completely within modern culture and so far from considering this UNK to god have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him STOP 
START when we say then that today in our situation the demand for UNK must be accepted without condition we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an UNK achievement STOP 
START however much we may have to UNK liberal UNK constructive formulations the theology we ourselves must UNK to UNK can only go beyond liberalism not behind it STOP 
START in UNK this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the UNK into which UNK attempt to UNK such a theology has led STOP 
START for we have said in effect that of the two alternatives to his position UNK represented by the other UNK in the UNK discussion only one is really an alternative STOP 
START if the demand for UNK is UNK and so must be accepted by theology UNK the position of the right is clearly UNK STOP 
START whereas UNK center position is UNK UNK and is therefore UNK on formal grounds alone the general position of the right as represented say by UNK UNK involves the rejection or at least UNK of the demand for UNK and so is UNK on the material grounds we have just considered STOP 
START it follows then provided the possibilities have been exhausted that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left which has been represented on the continent by UNK UNK and to some extent at least is found in much that is significant in american and english theology STOP 
START in order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible we may develop this argument at greater length STOP 
START we may show first that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START to do this it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to UNK more than two then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question STOP 
START thus if what is at issue is whether all s is p it is indifferent whether some s is not p or no s is p since in either case the judgment in question is false STOP 
START hence if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected it is UNK whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted in either event the first possibility is UNK STOP 
START therefore the only conceivable alternatives are those represented on the one hand by the two at least apparently UNK but mutually exclusive positions of UNK and UNK and on the other hand by the third but really UNK position UNK to a round square of UNK STOP 
START a second point requires more extended comment STOP 
START it will be recalled from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the right as represented by UNK rests on the following UNK the only UNK alternative to UNK position is a theology that 1 rejects or at least UNK his UNK demand for UNK and UNK interpretation 2 UNK instead a special biblical UNK or method of interpretation 3 in so doing UNK itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by means of statements that from UNK point of view are mythological STOP

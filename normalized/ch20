START wildlife habitat resources in 1960 UNK of the UNK million recreation visits to the national forests and UNK were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing STOP 
START hunter and UNK visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the UNK sale of hunting and fishing UNK STOP 
START this use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by UNK STOP 
START the long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game UNK to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment STOP

START protection the total adverse impact of disease insects fire weather destructive animals and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized STOP 
START they kill and destroy UNK or prevent UNK and growth UNK and damage values and UNK uses STOP 
START the loss in growth of UNK because of damage by destructive agencies in the united states in 1952 was estimated to be about UNK billion board feet STOP 
START if it were not for the effect of destructive agencies UNK growth would have been nearly twice as great as the UNK billion board feet in 1952 STOP 
START about 45 percent of the loss in growth was UNK to disease 20 percent to insects 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animals and various other causes STOP 
START these destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the UNK and their UNK UNK and upon the other UNK forest resources STOP 
START the long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously UNK with intensive management of the national forest system under principles of multiple use and UNK sustained yield of products and services STOP 
START this can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease UNK STOP 
START in addition to direct protection measures more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease STOP 
START protection from insects and disease in the UNK period it is proposed that insect and disease control on the national forest system be stepped up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease UNK that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large UNK toward the end of the initial period STOP 
START this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection STOP 
START the work will consist of 1 STOP 
START UNK of present activities through a UNK more extensive and more thorough surveys to UNK UNK UNK b more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial UNK to cause widespread damage c UNK and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a UNK epidemic STOP 
START the initial UNK activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK of present UNK UNK control work plus extension of control to UNK acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production STOP 
START the objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed STOP

START UNK of UNK control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses STOP 
START protection from fire it is proposed that in 10 years all commercial UNK all critical UNK and other lands in the national forest system developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak UNK STOP 
START this will include UNK million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection STOP 
START an additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation STOP 
START meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for 1 STOP 
START UNK modernization and development of fire control to a UNK and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and UNK fires before they spread beyond permitted standards STOP 
START this is to be accomplished by nearly UNK the present level of preventive effort detection skilled UNK UNK and equipment use STOP 
START this will include a UNK program of training and development of personnel STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention for UNK of fires while small and for stopping large fires while running and burning UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK of UNK fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to UNK areas STOP 
START this work will cover the most serious UNK of all land UNK such treatment and will consist of burning UNK acres of highly UNK UNK concentration UNK UNK on UNK acres of high UNK areas prescribed burning on UNK million acres UNK UNK fuel on UNK acres and clearing and maintaining UNK miles of UNK STOP 
START protection from other damage UNK control work for the UNK period will be aimed at control of the most serious UNK of UNK UNK such as UNK and UNK on UNK areas of UNK and commercial UNK STOP 
START these areas comprise about half of the total area of UNK UNK on the national forests STOP 
START approximately UNK million acres of UNK and UNK million acres of UNK would be treated in this period STOP 
START control would be limited to those UNK for which economical means of control are known STOP 
START roads and trails the transportation system which serves the national forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various UNK and UNK STOP 
START this system is divided into a forest highway system administered by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administered by the secretary of agriculture STOP 
START both of these systems are essential for the production development and use of the national forests STOP 
START in the forest highway system there are now UNK miles of public roads STOP 
START these are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one UNK to another STOP 
START because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provided by the states and counties this development program for the national forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the UNK to it that are needed STOP 
START it is estimated that about UNK miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the national forests STOP 
START in the forest development road and trail system there are now UNK miles of roads and UNK miles of UNK foot and horse trails STOP 
START these roads are largely of less than highway standards and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the national forests STOP 
START construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture STOP 
START it is estimated that about UNK miles of forest development roads and UNK miles of trails constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum UNK yield and use of the wood water UNK and wildlife and recreation resources of the national forests on a continuing basis STOP 
START the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife UNK and fire protection STOP 
START it will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and UNK STOP 
START the presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and UNK such as a the protection of UNK timber and wildlife resources from fire insects and disease b the balanced use of recreation hunting and fishing areas c the volume of timber that can be UNK especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises d the level of UNK cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly UNK losses resulting from fire UNK insects and disease e the protection of UNK lands from UNK and UNK by animals STOP 
START the existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all national forest purposes that is not otherwise possible STOP 
START furthermore roads that give access to national forest timber are UNK which pay their own way over a period of years STOP 
START use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the UNK the roads serve STOP 
START the long-range objective of this department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the national forest system at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services STOP 
START for the year UNK this means UNK a the protection requirements of a UNK producing at least 200 million UNK of water each year b recreation and wildlife resources used each year by UNK million visitors c a timber UNK supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet and d 60 million acres of UNK STOP 
START service at these levels of production and UNK will eventually require the construction of about UNK miles of new roads and UNK miles of new trails along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about UNK miles of roads and UNK miles of trails STOP 
START about UNK miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads STOP 
START about 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year UNK STOP 
START program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the UNK period UNK are as follows 1 STOP 
START UNK the construction and reconstruction of about UNK miles of UNK roads and UNK miles of trails STOP 
START this constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities STOP 
START approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by UNK of national forest timber but paid for by the government through adjustment of UNK prices STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK maintenance to full standards on the UNK miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period STOP 
START land adjustment land purchase land use within the units in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership is quite UNK STOP 
START in some units national forest ownership is well blocked together STOP 
START in many others the previous UNK of land under the public land laws or the way in which land was available for purchase resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership STOP 
START within UNK boundaries of national forests and national UNK there are about UNK acres in UNK ownership STOP 
START one consequence is the occurrence of occasional UNK because private owners of some UNK object to public programs of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land or because such UNK are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land STOP 
START some privately held UNK are a source of direct damage to these federal lands STOP 
START and some which are suitable for tree growing and for other national forest purposes are UNK or in need of expensive rehabilitation and are contributing nothing to the economy are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be UNK or changed STOP 
START lands in this last category are situated largely in the UNK portions of the eastern states STOP 
START the long-range objective is to bring about UNK of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of UNK which comprise key UNK for recognized national forest programs such as recreation development or which are a source of damage to lands in national forests and national UNK STOP

START the study of the st. louis UNK economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference UNK and UNK both the findings of the metropolitan st. louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the UNK UNK STOP 
START st. louis UNK in the center of a relatively UNK and in some places UNK UNK region STOP 
START UNK regional demand for st. louis goods and services reflects the UNK relative lack of purchasing power STOP 
START not all st. louis industries of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood STOP 
START but for those which do the slow growth of the area has a UNK effect on the metropolitan core STOP 
START the city has a stake in UNK growth and purchasing power throughout UNK missouri and southern illinois STOP 
START gov. UNK new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a UNK regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry STOP 
START that is one approach STOP 
START another would be to take the advice of dr. UNK UNK president of the university of missouri and provide for an UNK professional analysis of UNK economy STOP 
START he says the state in order to proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and UNK into the national economy STOP 
START the research center of the UNK school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr. UNK has been talking about STOP 
START he and dean john w. UNK of the business school UNK the project at a recent conference STOP 
START the university can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic development through such a study STOP 
START in southern illinois the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth STOP 
START the UNK industrial development corp. has obtained a UNK loan to help UNK the cost of UNK a UNK factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs STOP 
START UNK is in the UNK UNK labor market where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average STOP 
START the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on UNK depressed areas and in the long run that will benefit st. louis as well STOP 
START UNK st. UNK county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development STOP 
START more industrial acreage lies vacant in st. UNK county than in any other jurisdiction in the st. louis area STOP 
START the UNK political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side STOP 
START and then there is st. louis county where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound UNK of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth STOP 
START st. louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted parochial interests to take priority over UNK interests STOP 
START some UNK specialists take these signs to mean st. louis county doesn't want industry and so they avoid the area and more jobs are lost STOP 
START metropolitan st. UNK relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi STOP 
START without a great acceleration in the metropolitan UNK economy there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and st. louis will slip into UNK status STOP 
START an excess of UNK many of our very best friends are UNK STOP 
START still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far STOP 
START take for example the UNK among new york city's democrats STOP 
START having whipped mr. de UNK in the UNK and thus come into control of UNK hall they have changed the name to UNK hall STOP 
START even though headquarters actually have been moved into the UNK building do they believe that they can make the new name stick that the UNK name and the UNK UNK often were regarded as UNK of political shame the UNK of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit STOP 
START but it is tradition rather than the record which UNK at the UNK of the UNK name STOP 
START after all it goes back to the days in which UNK was not UNK the days in which the sons of st. UNK UNK to UNK the government by force and violence the british government that is STOP 
START further do our UNK friends really believe that the UNK will consent to the UNK of the UNK from their UNK will when they give up the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START instead of attempting the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the UNK UNK are not black might go over STOP 
START the UNK case the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former UNK official UNK UNK UNK from his UNK position as UNK of cuban UNK for the UNK service STOP 
START the UNK appointment was UNK on several grounds STOP 
START the kennedy administration had assured UNK UNK that it would have nothing to do with associates of UNK UNK STOP 
START using a UNK man to screen UNK represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro STOP 
START moreover UNK UNK information on cuba was too UNK to be useful in UNK castro agents colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power STOP 
START and while he had headed UNK UNK section the UNK regime did not UNK the communists so much as more open opponents who were UNK to be communists STOP 
START responsibility for the UNK appointment rests with gen. j. m. swing an eisenhower UNK as head of the UNK service STOP 
START gen. swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the UNK of his office STOP 
START his official term UNK last summer STOP 
START some reports say he was UNK from UNK retirement by his friend congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy administration was UNK searching for all the house votes it could get STOP 
START congressman walter has been UNK in UNK matters but he has announced plans to UNK in 1962 STOP 
START at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen. swing STOP 
START the UNK case was the kind of UNK job the administration should not have to repeat STOP 
START mr. eisenhower politician as president dwight d. eisenhower often assumed a role UNK from the UNK of partisan politics STOP 
START as a former president however mr. eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan UNK during a new york republican UNK and generally missed his target STOP 
START mr. eisenhower seized upon the incident of the UNK lost by a peace corps girl in UNK to attack the entire corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon STOP 
START this was juvenile UNK STOP 
START nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad STOP 
START his words were the more UNK to come from a man who UNK his name to the eisenhower exchange UNK dedicated to the same goal of international understanding STOP 
START the former president UNK ignored recent history in speaking of UNK dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies STOP 
START it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest UNK deficit STOP 
START finally mr. eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington STOP 
START this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too STOP 
START the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded STOP 
START UNK relieved of UNK for policy sometimes seem to feel free of UNK for their words STOP 
START some of former president UNK UNK UNK have been in that vein STOP 
START nobody can deny the right of former chief UNK to take part in politics but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility STOP 
START this is a matter of respect for the presidency STOP 
START mr. eisenhower's new york speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder UNK STOP 
START queen of the UNK the queen mary has long been a symbol of speed luxury and UNK british service on the high UNK STOP 
START reports that the UNK UNK which has been in service since UNK was to be retired struck a UNK note in many of us STOP 
START but the UNK line influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment has decided to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least STOP 
START a new queen with the UNK title of UNK had been planned for several years to replace the queen mary STOP 
START the british government concerned about the threat of unemployment in the UNK industry had put through a bill to give UNK loans and grants UNK UNK toward the UNK cost of a new UNK passenger UNK STOP 
START since 1957 more and more UNK passengers have been crossing by air STOP 
START economy class UNK and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the UNK STOP 
START competition from other UNK lines has cut UNK share of sea passengers from one-third to UNK and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the atlantic run STOP 
START the UNK line has under consideration UNK the queen mary with a ship smaller than UNK tons STOP 
START this would be cheaper to operate and could be used for UNK during the lean winter months STOP 
START also under consideration is an increased investment in UNK UNK UNK which has applied to serve new york STOP 
START the decline of the UNK line from its position of dominance in atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation STOP 
START mission to viet nam gen. maxwell UNK statement in UNK that he is very much encouraged about the chances of the pro-western government of viet nam turning back communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend UNK united states troops to UNK the UNK army STOP 
START gen. taylor will report to president kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to south viet nam and judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the far east he is likely to urge a more efficient UNK of UNK military economic political and other resources STOP 
START there was good reason for gen. taylor to make an inspection trip at this time STOP 
START communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the UNK river has UNK a new crisis STOP 
START south viet UNK rice surplus for next year more than UNK tons may have been destroyed STOP 
START the viet UNK the communist rebels may have lost their stored grain and arms factories STOP 
START the rebels may try to UNK what is left of the october harvest when the UNK UNK and the UNK ends in november STOP 
START nothing that is likely to happen however should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than UNK missions STOP 
START the UNK struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 when gen. UNK estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the french were losing STOP 
START it is a war to stay out of today especially in view of the fact that president UNK UNK UNK apparently does not want united states troops STOP 
START he may want additional technical help and this should be forthcoming STOP 
START south viet nam has received UNK in united states aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since vice president UNK b. UNK visit last may STOP 
START gen. taylor the president's special military UNK is a UNK officer who is not likely to UNK to propaganda or pressure STOP 
START it is probable that his recommendations will be informed and UNK and that they will not lead to involving the united states in an UNK UNK STOP 
START gov. john m. UNK himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the missouri general assembly or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have UNK with or UNK to UNK with the government and who are retained not because of their legal talents but because of their government influence STOP

START he came to UNK directly from the boat that brought him to america from russia STOP 
START he was a learned man and a very gentle soul STOP 
START he was filled with knowledge of the bible and the UNK STOP 
START he knew the UNK and the UNK but he was weak very weak on the UNK STOP 
START banks the UNK took meltzer the scholar as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must be able to do more than just quote the UNK of the UNK in order to live STOP 
START so meltzer learned a new trade from banks who supplied the town and the hotels with meat STOP 
START banks had a family a wife a daughter and a son STOP 
START the daughter UNK was a very good friend of mine and i always had hopes that someday she and meltzer would find each other STOP 
START they lived in the same house and it didn't seem to be such a hard thing to do but the sad realities of UNK life and the fact that meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my UNK thinking STOP 
START banks the UNK was a hard master and a hard father a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living flesh of his family and the hanging UNK of his stock in trade STOP 
START he treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that hung silently from his UNK STOP 
START UNK banks and i became friends STOP 
START she was the opposite of everything she should have been a positive pole in a negative home a living reaction of warmth and UNK to the harsh reality of her father STOP 
START and UNK whole family seemed to be an UNK for mr. banks STOP 
START her brother UNK was a very gentle soul her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard UNK eyes STOP 
START for every UNK word of mr. UNK the family had five in UNK STOP

START i helped UNK in the store STOP 
START to me it was a game to her it was the deadly UNK of life STOP 
START i wanted to help so that we could find time to play STOP 
START and UNK allowed me to help so that she could have her few little hours of escape STOP 
START when the work was finished we would walk STOP 
START the road past the UNK shop took us along the side of a stream STOP 
START it ran north away from the town and the people through woods and past the UNK of a UNK STOP 
START UNK preferred the UNK of that walk STOP 
START i would have liked the town and the UNK of its people but i always followed UNK into the peace of the silent and UNK road STOP 
START it wasn't hard to understand STOP 
START to me UNK was a fine and lovely girl STOP 
START to people who didn't know her she was a UNK badly dressed kid whose arms were too long whose legs were a little too UNK STOP 
START she had the UNK of a boy and a UNK walk that reminded me of a string of UNK UNK down the street STOP 
START and she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked STOP 
START it was unexpected unexpected because UNK walked with her head bent down down and her mark of friendship was to look into your face STOP 
START i accepted her crossed eyes as she accepted my UNK compared to her UNK understanding that life was a punishment for as yet UNK sins STOP 
START we were almost the same age she was fifteen i was twelve and where i felt there was a life to look forward to UNK felt she had had as much of it as was necessary STOP 
START when we went for our walks UNK brother would come along every once in a while STOP 
START UNK was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it was strange to see the expected become the unexpected STOP 
START this huge UNK played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream STOP 
START UNK played well and his favorite song was a UNK UNK STOP 
START he spoke no german but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew in a foreign language STOP 
START the song he said was called the UNK UNK and when he sang UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK die UNK UNK there was such UNK and such simple UNK that it frightened me STOP 
START later when i was older i found the song was part of UNK die UNK UNK STOP 
START and even hearing it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and the melody would make me a little UNK and i would reach out for my husband's hand STOP 
START the brother and sister seemed to be a sort of UNK society a little UNK of UNK for each other in a hard world STOP 
START i felt very UNK to be included in the protection of their company even though i had nothing to be protected from STOP

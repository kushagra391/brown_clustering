START i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized then headed for home STOP 
START maybe to beat up on his UNK STOP 
START benson looked up and saw UNK long head UNK forward to UNK his chin on the stiff edge of the overall UNK STOP 
START ramey reached out with the tire iron and UNK a UNK of mud that was UNK on the spare tire UNK STOP 
START i'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand the liquor or automobiles STOP 
START somehow the thought of a simple man UNK by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver STOP 
START for a moment his hatred toward UNK or UNK drivers UNK STOP 
START maybe the indian wasn't too much at fault ramey thought STOP 
START maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any of us STOP 
START anyway he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at STOP 
START ever see yourself spread out on the pavement UNK said to his partner STOP 
START you mean dream not exactly STOP 
START just see it STOP 
START benson grinned and UNK a rock with his UNK like a marble STOP 
START UNK just you all the time sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent partner STOP 
START ramey smiled but he thought to himself i always see me too STOP 
START never UNK STOP 
START whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind STOP 
START then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think STOP 
START with this realization sometimes he saw himself as he looked down STOP 
START you seen him yet said referring to the indian STOP 
START he wasn't in the car ramey said STOP 
START you didn't go clear around benson said STOP 
START if you want to see something he's back on the other side by the UNK of the car STOP 
START too long a waiting line ramey answered pretending to joke STOP 
START a few minutes later the insurance man a road UNK drove up in the gray UNK with license plates on it from a UNK state STOP 
START it was a trick they used to try and UNK their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed STOP 
START sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed STOP 
START all the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big UNK straw hat with UNK edges the kind natives in travel UNK wear when they are out UNK UNK cane STOP 
START UNK an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to look like a tourist STOP 
START it had always seemed strange to ramey that to UNK himself as a tourist an UNK driver like UNK would merely pick something UNK and put it on his head STOP 
START the insurance man informed them that he had talked to UNK who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they UNK the UNK back to town STOP 
START he UNK with ramey and benson for a minute or so in the UNK shade of the trailer STOP 
START every so often the UNK sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for the UNK then UNK up again as it got clear STOP 
START when they were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer STOP 
START there's a body you won't mind looking at benson said and they stopped STOP 
START she had driven up with her husband in a UNK with eastern license plates although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that STOP 
START she wore shorts and a loose UNK shirt STOP 
START slender and UNK her dark brown hair was drawn straight back simply STOP 
START what outfit does she drive for said STOP 
START seeing her caused a UNK in ramey a recognition STOP 
START she might have been someone he had once loved STOP 
START he had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run STOP 
START the truck UNK the industrial areas with walls UNK with UNK smoke passed briefly through his mind back UNK were their access to a city and they could never stay STOP 
START how would you ever see her again feeling UNK it was only a small UNK STOP 
START their work was lonely STOP 
START what's she doing in this bunch said and ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been STOP 
START the girl looked around at the UNK STOP 
START her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing STOP 
START it made only a tiny UNK over the two men like a tire over a piece of UNK then moved on STOP 
START she began to watch a UNK man also in shorts standing right at the rear of the UNK car in the one spot that most of the crowd had UNK slightly STOP 
START what had caught his attention was UNK by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but benson knew what it was STOP 
START the girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when benson in that UNK UNK ramey could never decide was real said you don't want to go around there UNK STOP 
START the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her STOP 
START the man stood near the bent UNK body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car STOP 
START the two drivers moved closer STOP 
START what does he want a UNK said to ramey STOP 
START one tiny detail in a happening can UNK the memory and stick like meat in a UNK tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go UNK and uncertain STOP 
START with ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was UNK the UNK foot that he would always remember STOP 
START the UNK were broken at the bottom of the UNK but there was still a bow UNK at the top STOP 
START the slightest UNK would have UNK the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still inside STOP 
START the two men in UNK stood just behind the UNK man STOP 
START he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck the UNK pushed above the UNK STOP 
START he turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes UNK eyes STOP 
START he was very UNK big hands might have torn him from a UNK UNK STOP 
START he's dead isn't he man said STOP 
START he turned and bent over the body of the indian STOP 
START there was nothing in particular on the man's face STOP 
START it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine STOP 
START what's this man said UNK up a step still looking down STOP 
START his words were mostly to himself STOP 
START don't STOP 
START there was a gentle concern in UNK voice STOP 
START ramey looked down and saw the white UNK at the bottom of the man's UNK leg UNK UNK a bit of folded UNK substance lying by itself on the pavement STOP 
START but what is it man said with a tone of UNK STOP 
START but what is it man had spoken only once STOP 
START ramey heard the words again inside UNK the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure whether it was sound or UNK pressing in his ears STOP 
START the UNK reached out once more to tap against the mass and UNK vision UNK except for an UNK clarity of the man's leg STOP 
START ramey saw sunlight touch the UNK blonde hairs on the brown skin STOP 
START he stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees don't do that UNK STOP 
START UNK brains STOP 
START the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist STOP 
START ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth STOP 
START it was a straight solid UNK shot laid all four UNK in between the man's UNK and his chin STOP 
START UNK fist and the air UNK from the man's UNK cheek made a hollow UNK in the air like UNK hands UNK together STOP 
START the man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement STOP 
START ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand STOP 
START as he watched the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet STOP 
START he hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard STOP 
START with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out in front of him STOP 
START his arms hung like empty shirt UNK and his mouth was slightly open STOP 
START after what seemed several seconds the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to UNK from it STOP 
START the man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers UNK across his face until he touched his mouth STOP 
START he UNK and pulled the hand away STOP 
START even yet there was no realization in his eyes STOP 
START ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him STOP 
START he did not look around STOP 
START what happened said STOP 
START he's hurt woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of UNK from the man's wife STOP 
START the man on the ground began to move of his hands UNK out on the pavement and supported him STOP 
START blood UNK down the front of his sweater UNK into a dark UNK of dirt that ran UNK across the white UNK on his shoulder as though the bright v UNK into the UNK had UNK running a UNK color STOP 
START the girl UNK by her husband with one arm at his back STOP 
START can you hear can you talk to me begged STOP 
START an UNK puzzled sound came from the red mouth STOP 
START the girl looked around quickly at several of the people STOP 
START none of the crowd had stepped forward to help STOP 
START then she saw ramey and her face was UNK with UNK STOP 
START why did you do it why did you hit him said her voice rising STOP 
START ramey said nothing STOP 
START a UNK in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again STOP 
START behind ramey feet UNK beneath sharp questioning UNK STOP 
START no one seemed to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the UNK feet and urgent voices behind the driver beyond finding out STOP 
START ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the UNK truck talking to the patrolman STOP 
START benson moved his arms UNK with an UNK vigor and talking rapidly STOP 
START ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man STOP 
START some of the UNK was gone from his face and he stared at ramey STOP 
START it's all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them STOP 
START ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the UNK on the metal sides of the trailer STOP 
START he saw the dark sweat spots UNK in and out of sight under the UNK swinging arms and in the leather UNK that UNK and rolled at the side of his UNK body the sun left a UNK UNK on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the UNK UNK of his pistol STOP 
START all right step back patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in UNK STOP 
START he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him STOP 
START you all right UNK it's my UNK the man said trying to talk without moving his lips STOP 
START his brown face looked gray from dirt UNK where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it STOP

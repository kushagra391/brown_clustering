START los angeles in 1957 finally UNK to the UNK STOP 
START and without high density in the core UNK systems cannot be maintained economically let alone built from UNK at today's prices STOP 
START however the building of UNK and UNK cannot continue forever STOP 
START the new UNK among the four los angeles UNK including the UNK UNK UNK by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land UNK of a square mile an area about the size of rockefeller center in new york STOP 
START it is hard to believe that this mass of UNK concrete constitutes what the law calls the highest and best use of UNK located urban land STOP 
START as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an UNK is UNK UNK forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services STOP 
START UNK improved land values without taking away land boost UNK less because the UNK they require are not prime buildings by a long shot and reduce the acreage that can be taxed STOP 
START downtown los angeles is already two-thirds UNK UNK street parking lot and garage one of those UNK if statistics has already come to pass STOP 
START the UNK with UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial UNK boundary STOP 
START city planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might STOP 
START less ambitious UNK plans may be more successful especially when the UNK and UNK are raised allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the UNK STOP 
START meanwhile the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance STOP 
START in ever greater numbers factories are UNK in the suburbs or in industrial parks removed from the city's political jurisdiction STOP 
START the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry which must move UNK objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor STOP 
START to light industry the UNK of being on one floor are much UNK but efficiency engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers STOP 
START this movement of industry away from the central cities is not so UNK new as some UNK seem to believe STOP 
START it is merely the latest example of the UNK growth which formed the pattern of virtually all american cities STOP 
START the big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities the rubber factories in UNK UNK detroit plants u.s. UNK pittsburgh works often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city yet close to transport river storage UNK and power river STOP 
START the UNK was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam UNK and the time when the UNK of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet UNK STOP 
START the truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site STOP 
START until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near a railroad UNK and a UNK line or an existing large community of UNK homes STOP 
START the railroad UNK is still important it is usually though not always true that UNK UNK by rail is cheaper than UNK STOP 
START but anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days and many businesses can live without the railroad STOP 
START and there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and UNK bus lines is actually more convenient than the UNK factory STOP 
START UNK run general UNK enormous installations at UNK and UNK the pentagon UNK in UNK douglas and UNK in los angeles the new automobile assembly plants everywhere none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit STOP 
START they are all suburban plants UNK on the roads to keep them supplied with workers STOP 
START and wherever the new UNK go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry STOP 
START the drive along UNK route UNK the UNK which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown boston may be a vision of the future STOP 
START the future could be worse STOP 
START the plants along route UNK are mostly well designed and UNK set against the new england rocks and trees STOP 
START they can even be rather grand like edward UNK monument to the UNK success of UNK STOP 
START but they deny the values of the city the crowded competitive UNK city the melting pot which gave off so many of the most UNK american qualities STOP 
START they are segregated businesses UNK again on one site the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated communities STOP 
START it is interesting to note how many of the plants on UNK route UNK draw most of their income either from the government in UNK UNK arrangements or from the UNK of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly STOP 
START while the factories were always the center of the labor market they were often on the city's UNK STOP 
START in spreading the factories even farther the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities STOP 
START even the loss of hotel business to the UNK motel has been relatively UNK UNK UNK is becoming harder to find every year STOP 
START what UNK most is the damage the automobile has done to UNK UNK especially in those cities where public transit is UNK STOP 
START some UNK of course always UNK with the population UNK stores UNK local UNK and dress shops candy stores and the like STOP 
START but whenever a major purchase was UNK forty years ago a new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter UNK a UNK for junior the family set off for the downtown department store where the selection would be greatest STOP 
START department stores UNK in the one hundred per cent location where all the transit lines UNK STOP 
START these stores are still there but the volume of the downtown store has been on a relative decline while in many cities the suburban branch sells more and more dry goods STOP 
START if the UNK and UNK downtown unit sales have been UNK however his dollar volume continues to rise and it is dollars which you put in the bank STOP 
START in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are substantially UNK STOP 
START no suburban UNK branch not even hudson's vast UNK outside detroit does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of UNK to be found in the home store STOP 
START telephone orders UNK the picture the UNK naturally calls a local rather than a UNK number if both are listed in an UNK especially if the local call UNK city sales tax STOP 
START the suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened STOP 
START accounting procedures which continue to charge a UNK overhead and UNK expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are STOP 
START in many cases that statement we break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches would be turned around if the cost analysis were UNK on terms less UNK to the old store STOP 
START fear of the competition always a great UNK force in the american economy makes UNK who do not have suburban operations UNK both the volume and the UNK of their UNK UNK new branches STOP 
START the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are UNK that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown and that even highly UNK cities will support only so many big branches STOP 
START moreover the cost of operations is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who act as UNK for retail giants are beginning to discover STOP 
START when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of american UNK STOP 
START just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same distance from home STOP 
START indeed there are some cities where the suburban shopping UNK customers who are UNK much nearer to downtown STOP 
START raymond vernon reports that residents of east st. louis have been driving across the mississippi through the heart of downtown st. louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town STOP 
START to the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive downtown management like that of UNK brothers in columbus ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door STOP 
START if the distant UNK of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or UNK the completion of the federal highway program STOP 
START and if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with nice people rather than with the UNK urban mass which supports the downtown department store the central location may be in serious trouble STOP 
START today according to land UNK homer UNK shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some UNK acres of land which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's central business districts put together STOP 
START the downtown store continues to offer the great UNK of variety both within its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately convenient for the UNK who wants to see what is available before making up her mind STOP 
START if anything may be predicted in the UNK world of UNK it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to UNK children's clothing taking the kid downtown is too much of a production household UNK and the discount business in UNK items STOP 
START department stores were built on dry goods especially UNK UNK and in this area in the long run the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown STOP 
START if this analysis is correct the suburban branches will turn out to be what UNK cost UNK refuse to acknowledge marginal operations rather than major factors STOP 
START historically in america the appeal of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience they offered STOP 
START how UNK gonna keep 'em down on the farm a question that had to be asked long before they saw UNK STOP 
START though americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown STOP 
START only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this UNK and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change UNK UNK by so many urban UNK is actually upon us STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK and negroes in their book american UNK UNK UNK and henry hope UNK argue that franklin UNK new deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility a fine UNK argument when you consider how UNK tend to vote STOP 
START the first UNK new UNK henry hudson and UNK lake shore san UNK bay bridge and its approaches a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression STOP 
START at the same time UNK federal housing administration coupled with henry UNK UNK policy permitted ordinary UNK families to build their own homes STOP 
START bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the u. s. government who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term UNK UNK found they could UNK for twenty-five years at 4 per cent under government UNK STOP

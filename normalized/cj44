START how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the right to UNK bond discount and premium section UNK but not the right to UNK bond issue expenses allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization section UNK but not a deduction for UNK losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depreciation section UNK but not allowing rapid UNK of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization allowing survival of a UNK carryover to a personal holding company section UNK but not carryover of excess tax UNK for foreign taxes items and most of the others listed above seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section UNK STOP 
START there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax UNK or in terms of UNK possibilities STOP 
START with respect to items such as these the provisions of section UNK viewed in historical perspective suggest a rule requiring survival whether the items are beneficial or UNK to the surviving corporation STOP 
START to this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified since the literal meaning UNK with the clear UNK if not the language of the statute STOP 
START it is not contended that section UNK should UNK the survival of all of the UNK tax attributes STOP 
START such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone would certainly UNK the intention of congress as expressed in the committee report in at least one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another provision of the united states code STOP 
START refund claims section UNK of the united states code UNK an assignment of a claim against the government unless made after it has been allowed the amount due has been UNK and a warrant for its payment has been issued STOP 
START if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this section would UNK a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section UNK STOP 
START a clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or UNK STOP 
START the leading case UNK air line railway v. united states held that the UNK could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor and it has been consistently followed STOP 
START the court said the purpose of the section was UNK to spare the government the UNK and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly UNK claims against the government STOP 
START neither reason said the court applied to the case at hand congress could not be presumed to have intended to UNK UNK approved by the states STOP 
START other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of UNK corporate UNK transfers by descent or transfers by UNK STOP 
START exceptions are often classified as transfers by operation of law STOP 
START a UNK reorganization not UNK with the merger or UNK UNK of the states involved is difficult to fit into an operation of law mold STOP 
START although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash to which section UNK quite clearly applies the courts and treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of UNK UNK may sue for refund of taxes paid by UNK STOP 
START a recent case in point is mitchell UNK v. united states in which a claim against the government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed by the partners STOP 
START holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim the court cited the UNK UNK trading and UNK cases for the proposition that transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not assignments UNK by the statute STOP 
START in an earlier case UNK co. v. united states an american corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british corporation in exchange for its own stock and then UNK the british corporation STOP 
START the UNK statute was held not to prevent the american corporation from UNK for a refund of taxes paid by the british corporation STOP 
START the UNK presumably would have qualified under section UNK as a UNK reorganization followed by a section UNK liquidation but not under section UNK as a statutory merger of UNK STOP 
START the court nevertheless UNK on the UNK case and also mentioned that the UNK of the two corporations were the same STOP 
START in substance said the court there was no transfer of equitable title STOP 
START the treasury UNK at substantially the same conclusion but UNK the problem of section UNK of the united states code STOP 
START revenue ruling UNK provides that if the corporation against which a tax was UNK has since been UNK by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor corporation STOP 
START proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed STOP 
START if the succession is a matter of public record UNK of the UNK of state or other public officials having UNK of the documents will UNK the succession is not of record all documents relating to such succession properly UNK are required STOP 
START the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or UNK the latter to a UNK acquisition STOP 
START the ruling would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash STOP 
START a recent ruling although rather UNK UNK and follows rev. UNK UNK STOP 
START the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or UNK reorganization STOP 
START hence a successor corporation in a c reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the UNK corporation despite section UNK STOP 
START in a b reorganization followed by a section UNK liquidation those cases which hold that section UNK is UNK to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor STOP 
START in fact a cash purchase of a UNK stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the UNK doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step STOP 
START these results appear sound STOP 
START as stated in UNK and numerous other cases the two primary reasons for the UNK of section UNK of the united states code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more than one UNK and to prevent the assignment of UNK claims on a UNK basis STOP 
START the cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed STOP 
START the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section UNK which is the only type presently under discussion STOP 
START section UNK applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a UNK owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or UNK an acquisition of substantially all a UNK assets solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity form or place of organization STOP 
START in virtually every case the transferor corporation is UNK and its former stockholders either own UNK or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise to the tax STOP 
START in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or UNK claims is UNK remote STOP 
START furthermore in a c reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger to which the statute is clearly UNK STOP 
START nor is it at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will be assigned on a UNK basis in the UNK of a UNK reorganization STOP 
START if the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes STOP 
START if such an unlikely UNK were to take place it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed by the UNK of the claim by the UNK UNK followed by liquidation STOP 
START in the rare case where a UNK only substantial UNK or its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps its transfer should not be permitted whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock STOP 
START it appears then that although the matter is not dealt with in section UNK a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section UNK is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation STOP 
START section UNK of the united states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the government transferred in UNK UNK STOP 
START the successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims STOP 
START other tax attributes of the transferor there are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved STOP 
START for example property used in the trade or business of a transferor corporation as defined in section UNK presumably would not retain its special status following a UNK reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation STOP 
START the parent of a group filing UNK returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section UNK but as a different corporation for this purpose after a UNK acquisition by another corporation which had not for example elected to file UNK returns with its own UNK STOP 
START similar considerations presumably made it difficult to UNK a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting section UNK or depreciation section UNK STOP 
START other sections of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of a UNK tax attributes following a UNK reorganization STOP 
START section UNK requires carryover of the transferor UNK basis for property transferred and section UNK provides for UNK on the UNK holding period for such property to that of the UNK STOP 
START section UNK permits a person acquiring UNK facilities to UNK to continue UNK over a UNK period STOP 
START however a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section UNK for a person acquiring emergency facilities STOP 
START attributes similar to a loss carryover STOP 
START -hlthere may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items STOP 
START for example suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of excess profits UNK STOP 
START this carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover STOP 
START it is an UNK device intended to ease the tax burden of UNK income is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax STOP 
START under the UNK code this item was permitted to survive a UNK reorganization in the UNK UNK case but only over the UNK of judge learned hand who wrote the majority opinion in the UNK case a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a UNK reorganization STOP 
START since this type of item was not in the statute when section UNK was enacted in 1954 one cannot say with certainty what effect the UNK of that section should have STOP 
START with respect to this type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee report quoted above which UNK against using section UNK as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned UNK STOP 
START actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover STOP 
START probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax UNK STOP

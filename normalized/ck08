START rousseau is so UNK that UNK is almost convinced that he should burn his books too STOP 
START but while the two men are riding into the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of UNK who strip them of everything including most of their clothes STOP 
START you must be a very learned man says UNK to one of the UNK STOP 
START a learned man UNK UNK in his face STOP 
START but UNK UNK STOP 
START he goes to the chief himself STOP 
START at what university did you study asks STOP 
START he UNK to believe that the UNK chief never attended a higher institution STOP 
START to have become so UNK he says surely you must have studied many arts and sciences STOP 
START the chief UNK by these questions UNK UNK down and UNK at him that he not only never went to any school but never even learned how to read STOP 
START when finally the two UNK men reach their UNK home UNK fears are once again aroused STOP 
START for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become UNK by all this culture STOP 
START to UNK surprise however their host gives them fresh clothes to put on opens his purse to lend them money and UNK them down before a good dinner STOP 
START immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another favor STOP 
START could he have pen and paper please is in a hurry to write another essay against culture STOP 
START such was the UNK that UNK gave to UNK of laughter at UNK UNK and that was soon UNK in UNK throughout the literary circles of europe to be printed sometime later but with the name of UNK of UNK the famous UNK substituted for that of rousseau STOP 
START how cruel at the same time how understandable STOP 
START how could the rich for whom life was made so simple ever understand the UNK the lies the UNK the errors sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life for example could a UNK understand the strange UNK in which a rousseau would find himself when soon after the UNK of his first UNK he acquired still another title to fame time as a musician STOP 
START as a composer STOP 
START ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it rousseau had dreamed of UNK through to fame as the result of a successful opera STOP 
START but his facility in this UNK was not great STOP 
START and his efforts to get a performance for his UNK UNK invariably failed STOP 
START and for good reasons STOP 
START his UNK music had little merit STOP 
START but then one day while on a UNK visit to the country home of a retired swiss UNK rousseau UNK the company with a few little UNK he had written to which he attached no great importance STOP 
START he was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs STOP 
START put a few such songs together they urged him STOP 
START string them onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a delightful UNK STOP 
START he didn't believe them STOP 
START nonsense he said STOP 
START this is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away heaven UNK the ladies UNK by his music STOP 
START you must make an opera out of this material STOP 
START and they wouldn't leave off UNK and pleading until he had promised STOP 
START oh the irony and the bitterness of it after all his years of effort to become a composer he should now now when he was still UNK UNK to the critics of his UNK on the arts and sciences be so close to a success in music and have to UNK it STOP 
START or at least appear to UNK it what else could he do couldn't on the one hand UNK the arts and at the same time practice them could you yes perhaps in literature since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself STOP 
START but now music too STOP 
START that would be too much the fault of course was UNK STOP 
START the fault was UNK and that of the whole culture of this UNK age STOP 
START for it was UNK type of music that he had been trying to write and that he couldn't write STOP 
START these little songs however were sweet UNK from the heart tender memories of his childhood little UNK that anyone could UNK and that would make one want to weep STOP 
START but no STOP 
START he couldn't appear as a composer now STOP 
START that glory UNK for so long was now forbidden to him STOP 
START still just for the ladies and just for this once for this one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his UNK STOP 
START the ladies were delighted and jean UNK was UNK STOP 
START and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote STOP 
START but then after the little UNK had been given its UNK amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the UNK in order to give it the really UNK performance it UNK STOP 
START rousseau was aware that he must seem like a UNK standing there and UNK that he could not possibly permit a public performance STOP 
START the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him STOP 
START a contradiction what was a contradiction in one's life woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes and saying yes when she meant no STOP 
START rousseau had to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance he would indeed just for his own private satisfaction UNK love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices STOP 
START i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think he said STOP 
START UNK the historian pointed out to jean UNK that this was impossible STOP 
START the musicians of the royal opera would not UNK a work merely to see how it would sound STOP 
START merely to satisfy the UNK curiosity STOP 
START rousseau agreed STOP 
START but he recalled that UNK had once had a private performance of his opera UNK behind closed doors just for himself alone STOP 
START UNK understood what was UNK rousseau that the writer of the UNK of UNK should now become known as the writer of an amusing little UNK STOP 
START that would certainly be UNK STOP 
START but UNK thought he saw a way out STOP 
START let me do the UNK to the royal academy he suggested STOP 
START your name will never appear STOP 
START no one will even suspect that it is your work STOP 
START to that rousseau could agree STOP 
START but now what crazy UNK and turns of his emotions at one and the same time that his work might be turned down which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author and that the work would be accepted and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly UNK how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself STOP 
START and how anxious this lover of UNK was for applause thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his UNK desire for UNK rousseau suffered through several painful weeks STOP 
START all these emotions were screwed up to new heights when after acceptance and the first UNK there UNK such a buzz of excitement among UNK music UNK that UNK had to come running to rousseau to UNK him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's UNK and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of UNK STOP 
START imagine the honor of it what was your answer UNK asked UNK to appear UNK STOP 
START i refused UNK said STOP 
START what else could i do de UNK was UNK of course STOP 
START but i said i would first have to get the UNK permission STOP 
START and i was certain he would refuse STOP 
START how UNK all this was had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his UNK and before he had committed himself to a life of UNK and denial when everything was opening up to him even the court of louis 15 he had to play a role of UNK STOP 
START back and forth UNK had to go between m. de UNK and jean UNK and between the duke UNK and jean UNK again as his little UNK the village UNK though still UNK took on ever more importance STOP 
START and of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his UNK friends STOP 
START but they naturally kept his secret well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles STOP 
START how UNK it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most UNK terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first UNK STOP 
START the UNK was such that people who could not possibly have UNK their way into the UNK were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be UNK STOP 
START and listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of UNK in a cafe rousseau found himself UNK in UNK trembling lest his UNK become known and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer STOP 
START he felt himself now as he himself says in his UNK at a crucial point of his life STOP 
START and that was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal UNK called to take him to the palace he did not bother to UNK STOP 
START on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days STOP 
START seeing him in that condition and about to enter the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all the members of the highest UNK would be present UNK and the UNK UNK and others tried to stop him STOP 
START you can't go in that way cried STOP 
START why not UNK asked STOP 
START who is going to stop me you haven't dressed for the occasion pointed out to him STOP 
START i'm dressed as i always am rousseau said STOP 
START neither better nor worse STOP 
START at home yes they argued STOP 
START but here you are in the palace STOP 
START there's the king STOP 
START and madame de UNK STOP 
START if they are here then surely i have the right to be here rousseau said STOP 
START and even more right STOP 
START since i am the composer but in such a UNK condition STOP 
START what is UNK about me asked STOP 
START is it because of my UNK that hair grows on my face it would grow there whether i washed myself or not STOP 
START a hundred years ago i would have worn a beard with pride STOP 
START and those without UNK would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion STOP 
START now times have changed and i must UNK that hair doesn't grow on my face STOP 
START that's the fashion STOP 
START and fashion is the real king here STOP 
START not louis 15 since even he UNK STOP 
START now if you don't mind i should like to hear my own piece performed STOP 
START but of course behind his UNK he didn't feel bold at all STOP 
START he UNK lest his piece should fail STOP 
START and this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society his fear of making some UNK or UNK remark STOP 
START and even deeper than that his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly UNK to relieve himself STOP 
START could he walk out in the midst of his piece before the court the king STOP

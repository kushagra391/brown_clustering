START the long and UNK column of UNK is now moving into a new era STOP 
START modern times have changed the world beyond recognition STOP 
START the early years of the twentieth century seem very far away STOP 
START but with all the changes in philosophy dress and UNK a few things remain constant including the devotion of americans to the great field sports hunting and fishing STOP 
START as the generations move on clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports STOP 
START UNK UNK change UNK for the better STOP 
START just as modern transportation has UNK the early UNK covered wagon the demand of today's UNK and women has necessitated changes in their equipment STOP 
START the american UNK and ammunition manufacturers through UNK research and technical development have replaced the UNK UNK and UNK UNK arms with modern fast firing UNK extremely accurate UNK lever and slide action UNK STOP 
START and millions of rounds of entirely new and modern UNK ammunition designed for today's hunting and target shooting STOP 
START and due to modern UNK and game management practices there is still game to shoot even with the UNK UNK on land and water STOP 
START present conservation practices regard wildlife not as an UNK natural UNK but as an annual harvest to be UNK and also UNK STOP 
START unlimited game UNK are possible and legal in more than 40 states on shooting preserves one of the newer phases of modern UNK for five and six months each year STOP 
START close to two million game birds were UNK on UNK commercial and private shooting preserves and on state game UNK UNK game areas during the UNK season STOP 
START the shooting development program of the UNK arms and ammunition UNK institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines many national UNK and the trade papers STOP 
START the most effective way to develop more places for more UNK to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves STOP 
START this has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program the new york staff of the UNK service bureau and the UNK shooting preserve field UNK since the start of the program in 1954 STOP 
START following the UNK of UNK shooting development program in 1954 a most interesting meeting took place in washington d.c. STOP 
START the group known as the american association for health physical education and recreation a division of the national education association initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the national rifle association UNK and the american fishing UNK manufacturers STOP 
START this meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to UNK what is known as the outdoor education project STOP 
START the outdoor education project took UNK of the fact so often UNK that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life STOP 
START the various team sports UNK have their place in every school and they are important to proper physical development STOP 
START but with the exception of professional UNK few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average american man or woman STOP 
START following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by UNK director dr. UNK smith today thousands of secondary schools colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs STOP 
START UNK financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education STOP 
START personnel assigned through the shooting development program have UNK participated in over UNK state and regional UNK at which hundreds of school UNK teachers professors and UNK leaders have been introduced to outdoor education STOP 
START considering that the current UNK potential is 23 million youths the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach STOP 
START in 1959 UNK shooting development program announced a new activity designed to UNK thousands of UNK boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports STOP 
START this program is now UNK known as UNK hunter clubs STOP

START UNK field men have served as UNK and have participated in 75 UNK hunter club activities which have reached over UNK enthusiastic young americans STOP 
START through the efforts of UNK shooting development program these shooting activities and many others including UNK in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks trap and UNK UNK rifle and pistol UNK programs have been promoted to mention only a few STOP 
START the continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the UNK need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand STOP 
START while individual UNK are aware of this situation too many of our political social educational and even religious leaders too often forget it STOP 
START help is needed from dealers at the UNK level STOP 
START the american gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful UNK program through their industry trade association STOP 
START since UNK conception in UNK and more specifically since the UNK of the shooting development program in 1954 millions of dollars and UNK UNK have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults STOP 
START we trust that you as a gun and ammunition dealer have UNK through additional sales of equipment STOP 
START are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports you looking ahead to the UNK market of millions of american boys and girls who will grow up to enjoy a traditional american way of life ranging the fields with a fine american gun and UNK excellent ammunition your UNK UNK and ammunition department UNK for the expanding UNK you like to organize UNK UNK clubs shooting programs and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game UNK on shooting preserves UNK UNK STOP 
START we were camping a few weeks ago on cape UNK UNK in that land of pirates UNK and UNK on north UNK UNK outer banks STOP 
START this beach UNK with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use STOP 
START with the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which americans are camping now STOP 
START there were UNK UNK wall UNK cottage UNK station wagon UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK baker UNK UNK with UNK frames UNK trailers travel trailers and even a few surplus UNK serving as UNK over entire family camps STOP 
START moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp UNK UNK UNK UNK games fishing UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START we saw similar displays in the other three UNK in this UNK national UNK recreation area STOP 
START dealers would do well to visit such a UNK often look at the equipment and talk with the UNK STOP 
START here you begin to appreciate the scope of the UNK and possibilities facing the industry STOP 
START camping is big and getting bigger STOP 
START no one knows where it will stop STOP 
START almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of americans to canvas UNK opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets STOP 
START you read various UNK on how many americans are camping STOP 
START the number depends on who is talking at the moment STOP 
START the figures range as high as 15 million families STOP 
START i've heard 10 million mentioned often but i'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping STOP 
START seven million families would total 30 million americans or more STOP 
START consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable STOP 
START more UNK than UNK UNK state park officials often have more UNK than they know what to do with STOP 
START they are struggling to meet the demand for camping space but families are being turned away especially on holiday UNK STOP 
START the national parks always popular camping places are facing the same pressure STOP 
START the national park service hopes by UNK to have UNK UNK available for UNK UNK a day almost twice what there are at present STOP 
START the u.s. forest service UNK for hundreds of thousands of UNK in its UNK national forests and is increasing its facilities steadily STOP 
START but the UNK still come STOP 
START they bring their families and UNK and camp UNK and UNK STOP 
START they bring their fishing UNK and UNK and bathing suits STOP 
START they come prepared for family fun because americans in UNK numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance STOP 
START why they keep coming there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the UNK to the UNK STOP 
START among them according to the u.s. department of commerce are 1 shorter work weeks 2 higher pay 3 longer paid UNK 4 better transportation 5 earlier retirement and 6 more education STOP 
START the more people learn about their country the more they want to learn STOP 
START camping is family fun and it is helping more americans see more of the country than they ever saw before STOP 
START but make no mistake about it the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy STOP 
START here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford STOP 
START the american automobile association computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of UNK STOP 
START the UNK then UNK it down this way UNK for meals UNK for UNK UNK for gas and oil and UNK for tips and UNK STOP 
START what does the camping couple do to this set of figures UNK for UNK they save STOP 
START because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that UNK food bill along with most of the tip money STOP 
START the automobile expenses are about the only UNK cost they can't either eliminate or UNK down UNK by camping along the way STOP 
START where americans used to think of a single vacation each summer they now think about how many UNK they can have STOP 
START long UNK enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year STOP 
START and even if they stay in UNK part of the time they might if the right salesman gets them in UNK develop a UNK to UNK the usual vacation UNK with a camping trip into the wide open spaces STOP 
START it would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning UNK on the idea they're buying the UNK of home STOP 
START they're not STOP 
START home is the place to find the UNK of home STOP 
START they're buying fun and adventure and family experiences STOP 
START but it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become STOP 
START this is no longer a way of life for the UNK UNK and the UNK cowboy STOP 
START today's UNK want UNK and they have them STOP 
START and this helps explain why so many people are now going camping STOP 
START it's fun and it's easy so easy that there is time left after cooking and tent keeping for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families STOP 
START camp meals are no great problem STOP 
START neither are beds thanks to air UNK and sleeping UNK STOP 
START neither are shelters because there is one to meet the needs of every UNK or prospective UNK STOP 
START but there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping UNK choose the best equipment for their individual needs STOP

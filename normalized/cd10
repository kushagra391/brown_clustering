START men need unity and they need god STOP 
START care must be taken neither to UNK unity with uniformity nor god with our parochial ideas about him but with these two qualifications the statement stands STOP 
START the statement also points to a classic UNK the more men turn toward god who is not only in himself the UNK of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established the more men UNK into groups and set themselves apart from one another STOP 
START to be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones with a resultant UNK of the human race STOP 
START UNK attending the UNK of india and the establishment of the state of israel are simply recent grim UNK of the UNK such divisions can UNK STOP 
START the words of cardinal UNK come UNK to mind oh how we hate one another for the love of god source of this UNK is not difficult to identify STOP 
START it lies in institutions STOP 
START institutions require structure form and definition and these in turn UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START a completely UNK institution would be a contradiction in terms escape this fate it must rule some things out STOP 
START for every criterion which UNK what something is at the same time UNK UNK if not openly what that something is not STOP 
START some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification we ought to UNK with churches STOP 
START the suggestion is naive STOP 
START man is at once a UNK animal and a UNK being STOP 
START having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers UNK he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its UNK STOP 
START to propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like UNK that they be learned without having schools STOP 
START both UNK are possible logically but practically they are impossible STOP 
START as much as men UNK need the unity that is UNK in god they UNK require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him STOP 
START yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows STOP 
START is there any way out of the UNK only way that i can see is through communication STOP 
START UNK communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our UNK STOP 
START approached UNK it is a high art STOP 
START it is the art of relating the finite to the infinite of doing our best to insure that the UNK requirements of religious institutions will not UNK god's intent of unity among men more than is UNK necessary STOP 
START in a certain sense UNK communication UNK diplomatic communication among the UNK STOP 
START what are the pertinent facts UNK such communication at the present UNK of history shall touch on three areas personal national and theological STOP 
START 1 by personal factors i mean those UNK in personality structure STOP 
START some UNK tensions are not UNK by theological differences at all but by the need of men to have persons they can blame UNK UNK and even hate STOP 
START such needs may rise to UNK proportions STOP 
START modern psychology has shown that UNK the UNK personality is the UNK personality in which UNK UNK suspicion and UNK combine to provide a target for UNK so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally STOP 
START fortunately the number of UNK UNK appears to be quite small but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree UNK them from the rest of us STOP 
START to some extent the personal UNK that UNK attempt to UNK for are to be found in all of us STOP 
START UNK UNK which spring from psychological UNK are the most unfortunate of all for they have no UNK features UNK STOP 
START it is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they rather than UNK for them that are causing the trouble and do everything possible to UNK the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such UNK STOP 
START 2 while the personality factors that UNK UNK conflict may be UNK nationalism is more variable STOP 
START the specific instance i have in mind is the UNK version which has gained UNK only in this second half of the twentieth century STOP 
START emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination the UNK world is UNK with a nationalism that has UNK UNK STOP 
START no less than UNK nations have already achieved independence since world war 2 and the number is growing by the year STOP 
START as an obvious consequence UNK to genuine UNK communication have grown more formidable in one important area relations between christians and UNK in these lands STOP 
START UNK alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious for christianity is so closely tied to UNK in the minds of these people that UNK of the one has tended automatically toward the UNK of the other STOP 
START actually however this turns out to be only part of the picture STOP 
START nationalism has UNK not only the UNK of foreign religions but the UNK of native ones some of which had been lying in UNK for centuries STOP 
START the truth is that any UNK of traditional and UNK religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and UNK which these young nations very much need STOP 
START UNK as these nations claim to UNK traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate UNK UNK for their existence such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone UNK STOP 
START all this works severely against the kind of UNK communication for which christian missions stand STOP 
START UNK and UNK tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda STOP 
START the people hardest hit by this suspicion are of course christians on the mainland of china STOP 
START but the problem extends elsewhere STOP 
START for example in burma and UNK many UNK argue that UNK ought to be the official state religion STOP 
START in 1960 UNK UNK its UNK UNK christian schools to the UNK of most of its UNK UNK and the UNK of its UNK roman catholics STOP 
START again india has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional UNK and UNK UNK parties are expected to seek further action against christians once the influence making for UNK due to UNK and his followers is gone STOP 
START the progressive closing of UNK ears to the christian message is UNK in a conversation i had three years ago while flying from UNK to UNK STOP 
START i was seated next to the director of the seventh day UNK world radio program STOP 
START he said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on japanese radio networks but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them STOP 
START after returning to the united states and raising the money he discovered on getting back to japan that the hours were no longer available STOP 
START it was not that they had been UNK for during the interval simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes STOP 
START it is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost UNK approach of certain UNK UNK toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed UNK to this UNK of UNK sentiment STOP 
START UNK these are the groups which have doubled or UNK their missionary efforts since world war 2 while the more established denominations are barely maintaining UNK UNK STOP 
START although i have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between christians and UNK in asia the fact is that this development has also UNK the gulf between certain UNK religions themselves STOP 
START the UNK of india has hardly improved relations between UNK and UNK has the establishment of the state of israel UNK harmony between UNK and jews STOP 
START 3 i turn finally to several theological developments STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START the modern world has been marked by progressive UNK with claims to divine sanction for the state whatever its political form STOP 
START the american constitution was historic at this point in providing that congress shall make no law UNK an establishment of religion or UNK the free exercise thereof STOP 
START one of our foremost UNK david UNK field has gone so far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history STOP 
START the trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional UNK STOP 
START UNK was created in 1947 UNK as a UNK state but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass UNK which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of UNK for the modern political situation STOP 
START what is the point charles adams reports the UNK as asking in demanding an UNK state and society if no one not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves can say clearly and UNK what the nature of such a state and society is current regime of president UNK UNK UNK is UNK secular STOP 
START and while the nation was formerly named the UNK republic of UNK it is now simply the republic of UNK STOP 
START comparable trends can be noted elsewhere STOP 
START the new regime in UNK is UNK less UNK than its UNK STOP 
START the religious parties in israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months STOP 
START during the years when israel was passing from crisis to crisis the UNK campaign the UNK of UNK of UNK UNK it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties STOP 
START now that israel UNK relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions the UNK are less disposed to compromise STOP 
START and in this country UNK UNK UNK of the line between the UNK and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state STOP 
START the failure at that time of the puerto UNK UNK to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to father UNK theological argument STOP 
START everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too UNK and UNK in a word too human to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START my father went as a missionary to china in a generation that responded to student UNK movement speakers who held UNK in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them STOP 
START that mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed STOP 
START i do not mean to imply that christians have adopted the liberal assumption so UNK in UNK that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit STOP 
START UNK UNK reflects the dominant position within the world council of churches when he says we must claim UNK and UNK for christ and his finished work but that very claim UNK us to claim UNK and UNK for our understanding of it STOP 
START UNK UNK on the christian claim is of considerable significance STOP 
START the roman catholic church has UNK one of its priests father UNK for UNK that there is no salvation outside the visible church STOP 
START in UNK this under salvation UNK i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is STOP

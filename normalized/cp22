START i knew it as surely as everybody in UNK that lucille was a husband UNK STOP 
START you can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only UNK STOP 
START and i've been told that just about every town no matter what its size has its lucille warren STOP 
START just as it has its susan UNK though UNK ever bothered to tell me that STOP 
START susan UNK that's me STOP 
START they even talked about lucille down at the young UNK league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission STOP 
START i never heard my folks talk about her though STOP 
START they were UNK religious people and i can UNK say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody STOP 
START even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me STOP 
START my folks and my faith protected me from things like that STOP 
START and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs. warren STOP 
START i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck STOP 
START i asked him if it was true STOP 
START he gave me a straight honest answer STOP 
START look sue baby he'd said STOP 
START much as i love you well a UNK a guy and UNK willing to to come across STOP 
START honest UNK that's all it is i don't even like lucille much STOP 
START i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren STOP 
START but it didn't seem fair STOP 
START my love for johnnie was young and clean how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didn't UNK to use her sex STOP 
START johnnie was a UNK with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good at anything in the UNK line STOP 
START it was a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff dad had ordered STOP 
START i wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was different STOP 
START he wasn't only different he was it STOP 
START he had an easy UNK grace about him the kind that kids don't have but that i had sometimes admired in other older men STOP 
START his smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp STOP 
START the most UNK thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too STOP 
START i could hardly believe such good luck was mine STOP 
START and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him STOP 
START i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she had set her sights on johnnie my johnnie STOP 
START i didn't like it one bit STOP 
START but what could i do man had to have his release at least that's what the boys used to say in high school and i wasn't providing it for johnnie STOP 
START neither was his wife STOP 
START she wouldn't have even if he'd asked her STOP 
START but he wouldn't ask her he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will STOP 
START and he wouldn't leave her either he'd told me that STOP 
START he was too honorable to leave his wife UNK and leave those helpless children without their UNK STOP 
START johnnie loved me and wanted me STOP 
START but the only love i was giving him was the pure kind STOP 
START it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time STOP 
START against my UNK wishes we'd been seeing each other for short UNK in the truck STOP 
START the UNK were UNK enough mostly we talked STOP 
START but by the time the first UNK of spring came around we both knew we were UNK in love STOP 
START yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little STOP 
START it's so crazy i told him once STOP 
START i always imagined i would probably end up UNK a minister or somebody like that STOP 
START somebody with no UNK STOP 
START you know STOP 
START and you fall for a lumber UNK STOP 
START who drinks far too much STOP 
START and UNK too much STOP 
START and i was UNK off the items on my fingers UNK too much and goes out with the boys whoever they are too much and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the UNK STOP 
START he examined his nails carefully STOP 
START i could walk out the door STOP 
START don't you dare STOP 
START and never show my face or my truck around here again STOP 
START he still wasn't looking at me STOP 
START you wouldn't STOP 
START or i could visit lucille warren STOP 
START you wouldn't STOP 
START please wouldn't STOP 
START he shrugged UNK STOP 
START i might STOP 
START and now he was seeing her STOP 
START he'd just admitted it to me STOP 
START i UNK UNK beside him in the truck STOP 
START it was all my doing his seeing her STOP 
START johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was the way i wanted to keep it STOP 
START at first johnnie hadn't understood how could he not being a religious person like me then he had said all right kid if that's how you want it that's how it'll be STOP 
START but what had i done trying to keep us pure had driven him into the arms of that UNK woman STOP 
START i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil one week later i UNK to him in the little motel on route 10 STOP 
START my very first time STOP 
START i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the UNK of lucille warren STOP 
START and though at the time i UNK to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other man had ever UNK STOP 
START i wanted him with a UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK enough it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness UNK this man to make love to me STOP 
START love me johnnie STOP 
START i will UNK in the UNK fields behind the motel a thousand UNK UNK us STOP 
START will you always love me this way UNK UNK STOP 
START always STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START and i UNK closer to the man i loved STOP 
START it was as UNK and UNK a night as any bride ever experienced STOP 
START i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no UNK of marriage but i had all the joy that goes with them STOP 
START johnnie it can't be wrong can it really STOP 
START johnnie rose on one UNK STOP 
START stop UNK STOP 
START it's never wrong if love is real STOP 
START i took great comfort from his words and smiled to myself in the darkness STOP 
START infinite peace complete UNK STOP 
START UNK delight i later discovered STOP 
START i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious UNK STOP 
START i had always UNK the passes made at me by other kids and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about STOP 
START i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and so in a way i was keeping my promise to god my promise to remain pure until i was married STOP 
START i was practically a bride after all STOP 
START there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible STOP 
START of this i had no doubt STOP 
START wouldn't johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness course he would STOP 
START he'd not only told me so he'd proved it STOP 
START it wasn't UNK fault that he was UNK tied down to that UNK woman who did her best to make his life UNK STOP 
START just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too STOP 
START and if i could contribute to that i'd do it STOP 
START the cost didn't matter STOP 
START no price is too high when true love is at stake STOP 
START and i had no doubts about how true this love was STOP 
START i'd never even UNK with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched me for the UNK while not until i all but threw myself at him STOP 
START he was plenty UNK all right but he behaved like a gentleman and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half STOP 
START what could a mere twelve years matter wasn't i was sure a difference in age that came between people but a difference in maturity STOP 
START and hadn't i UNK him from lucille warren have gotten him if i hadn't stopped her STOP 
START after all lucille warren was a UNK from way back STOP 
START but i'd been a good girl and now god was UNK me with the gift of this magnificent man and the UNK love we shared STOP 
START it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring STOP 
START love me UNK STOP 
START love you STOP 
START always and always johnnie always STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START convention time in boston STOP 
START a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow STOP 
START from the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming members of the young UNK league and i'd been chosen to represent our chapter STOP 
START i had mixed emotions about going STOP 
START i'd been seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didn't want to leave him for five whole days STOP 
START but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group STOP 
START i hadn't been doing as much work as i used to in UNK and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever STOP 
START i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group STOP 
START so i went to boston STOP 
START the first meeting was held in UNK hall a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states STOP 
START my cousin UNK at whose home i was staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people from rhode island STOP 
START one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow named UNK a boy about my age with UNK blond hair and dancing blue eyes STOP 
START he looked very different from johnnie in fact he looked sort of like me STOP 
START i thought so and he mentioned it and UNK said so too STOP 
START after the meeting there was going to be a party at UNK house STOP 
START i assumed UNK would get me there but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up we were separated STOP 
START outside the hall i UNK looked around for her then all at once there was a hand on my UNK STOP 
START hey there beautiful UNK of mine UNK said STOP 
START need a UNK to get to the party couldn't help laughing with him STOP 
START well i should find UNK i began STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START come along with me STOP 
START i went STOP 
START by the time we arrived the party was already going strong STOP 
START a couple of the girls were laughing rather UNK and i realized they were drinking STOP 
START my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house so my first taste of it had been of course with johnnie STOP 
START i hadn't liked it at first it was bitter and burning STOP 
START but when johnnie disguised the taste with UNK UNK i enjoyed it STOP 
START of course i enjoyed UNK anything if i did it with johnnie STOP 
START johnnie i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening STOP 
START but that was only natural i decided he was still resting UNK in my heart STOP 
START i don't see UNK anywhere i said STOP 
START she's UNK tonight STOP 
START UNK let's find out where they're keeping the glasses STOP 
START i drew back STOP 
START i i don't think so UNK STOP 
START not for me STOP 
START UNK come on STOP 
START no really STOP 
START he shrugged STOP 
START okay STOP 
START but at least come along while i get UNK STOP 
START the kitchen was UNK STOP 
START strange faces most of them and i wasn't even sure all of them had come from the league meeting STOP

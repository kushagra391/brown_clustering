START she was getting real dramatic STOP 
START i'd have been more impressed if i hadn't remembered that she'd played UNK UNK in her UNK UNK course STOP 
START i didn't want her back on that broken record STOP 
START UNK free in the whole UNK world was all i could think of to say STOP 
START when i'd delivered myself of that UNK there was nothing to do but order up another drink STOP 
START i am she said STOP 
START i'd forgotten all about UNK and the kentucky UNK and how it was UNK fifty dollars i was spending STOP 
START it was just me and eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because i wanted to UNK her neck because she was so UNK but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch STOP 
START drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me STOP 
START i was crazy about her all over again STOP 
START it was the call of the wild all right STOP 
START that evening turned out to be hell like all the others STOP 
START we moved down broadway from UNK to UNK STOP 
START it was the same old routine STOP 
START eileen got to dancing just a little tiny dancing step to a UNK UNK that you could hardly notice and trying to pick up strange men but each time i was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk so UNK in that sweet UNK voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together and there i was back on the UNK STOP 
START i did have the UNK to call up UNK and tell her i'd met old friends and would be home late STOP 
START i could UNK her eyes out eileen cried and UNK her foot when i came back from the phone UNK STOP 
START you know i don't like my men to have other women STOP 
START i hate it STOP 
START i hate it STOP 
START she got so drunk i had to take her home STOP 
START it was a walk up on hudson street STOP 
START she just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go STOP 
START there was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table STOP 
START the place UNK of some kind of hair UNK these UNK characters use STOP 
START what about UNK had to shake her to make her listen STOP 
START precious STOP 
START what about him she was very mysterious and dramatic STOP 
START precious and i allow each other absolute freedom STOP

START i'll just tell him you're my husband STOP 
START he can't object to that STOP 
START well i object STOP 
START if he UNK his nose in here i'll UNK him STOP 
START that really would be funny STOP 
START she began to laugh STOP 
START she was still laughing when i grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed STOP 
START after all i'm made of flesh and blood STOP 
START i'm not a plaster saint STOP 
START waking up was horrible STOP 
START never in my life have i felt so UNK about anything i've done as i did about spending that night with my own wife STOP 
START we both had UNK STOP 
START eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the UNK STOP 
START she lay under the covers making UNK motions with her UNK telling me where to look for the UNK STOP 
START i was UNK in my UNK trying to find my way around her damn UNK when i UNK that UNK sweet UNK smell STOP 
START there was somebody else in the apartment STOP 
START i UNK STOP 
START honest i could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a UNK that is going to get into a fight STOP 
START i turned around with the UNK in my hand STOP 
START my eyes were so UNK i could barely see him but there he was a little smooth UNK guy in a new spring UNK and a UNK UNK STOP 
START brown eyes UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK face without an expression in the world STOP 
START we didn't have time to speak before UNK voice was UNK at us from the bed STOP 
START joseph maria UNK meet francis UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK meet UNK STOP 
START she gave the UNK laugh i ever heard STOP 
START and don't either of you forget that i'm not any man's property STOP 
START if you want to fight go down on the sidewalk STOP 
START she was enjoying the situation STOP 
START imagine that STOP 
START eileen was a UNK all right STOP 
START instead of wanting to UNK the poor bastard i found myself having a UNK for him STOP 
START maybe he felt the same way STOP 
START i never felt such a UNK UNK in my life STOP 
START first thing i knew he was in the UNK cooking up the breakfast and i was UNK eileen her UNK and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her UNK STOP 
START i couldn't face UNK after that night STOP 
START i didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone STOP 
START i wrote her that i'd met up with eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express STOP 
START of course i had to give her UNK address but she never came near us STOP 
START all she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had UNK our ways and it was UNK forever STOP 
START she never said a word about the fifty dollars STOP 
START she added a UNK UNK me to be careful about drinking STOP 
START i must know that that was my greatest weakness UNK three times STOP 
START afterwards i learned that eileen had called UNK on the telephone and made a big scene about UNK trying to take her husband away STOP 
START that finished me with UNK STOP 
START trust eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation STOP 
START and there i was UNK up with eileen in that UNK fourth floor attic on hudson street STOP 
START i use the phrase UNK because there was something UNK UNK about our relationship STOP 
START i felt it and it ate on me all the time but i didn't know how right i was till later STOP 
START what i did know was that precious was always around STOP 
START he slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs STOP 
START who do you think pays the rent wouldn't have me throw the poor boy out on the street eileen said when i UNK her about it STOP 
START i said sure that was what i wanted her to do but she paid no attention STOP 
START eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear STOP 
START still i didn't think she was UNK me with precious right then STOP 
START to be on the safe side i never let eileen get out of my sight day or night STOP 
START precious had me worried STOP 
START i couldn't make out what his UNK was STOP 
START i'd thought him a UNK or UNK but he didn't seem to be STOP 
START he was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his UNK manner STOP 
START still he let eileen treat him like a UNK STOP 
START whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was precious who did the work STOP 
START i never could find out what his business was STOP 
START he always seemed to have money in his pocket STOP 
START the phone had been UNK but UNK came for him and notes by special UNK STOP 
START now and then he would disappear for several days STOP 
START connections was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading questions STOP 
START oh he's just an international UNK eileen would UNK with her UNK laugh STOP 
START poor devil he can't have been too happy either STOP 
START he got no relief from drink because though sometimes precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening he'd leave it on the table UNK STOP 
START when i was in liquor i rode him pretty hard i guess STOP 
START occasionally if i pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of UNK eyes and the hard cruel UNK UNK would show through that smooth face of his STOP 
START some day i told eileen that guy will kill us both STOP 
START she just wouldn't listen STOP 
START getting drunk every night was the only way i could handle the situation STOP 
START eileen seemed to feel the same way STOP 
START we still had that much in common STOP 
START the trouble was drinking cost money STOP 
START the way eileen and i were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening STOP 
START eileen must have UNK a little out of precious STOP 
START i raised some UNK by UNK the good clothes i had left over from my respectable UNK life but when that was gone i didn't have a cent STOP 
START i don't know what we would have done if pat UNK hadn't come to town STOP 
START pat UNK looked like a heavier jim STOP 
START he had the same bullet head of UNK UNK hair but he didn't have UNK UNK humor or his brains or his charm STOP 
START he was a big thick UNK violent man STOP 
START now pat may have been a UNK and a UNK but he was a good UNK catholic and he loved his little sister STOP 
START those UNK had that irish UNK that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything STOP 
START pat took eileen and me out to dinner at a UNK UNK house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again STOP 
START whom god UNK joined UNK STOP 
START the UNK were real religious people except for kate STOP 
START now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of UNK STOP 
START pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that fashion magazine STOP 
START it had gone big with the hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of art and UNK STOP 
START how about me trying to help her get her job back evening eileen had been as UNK as a little girl getting ready for her first communion STOP 
START it just about blew us both out of the water when eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with STOP 
START but brother i can't take a job right now she said with her eyes on her ice cream i'm going to have a baby francis UNK baby my own husband's baby STOP 
START my first thought was how had it happened so soon but i counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks STOP 
START pat meanwhile was UNK over with sentiment STOP 
START greatest thing that ever happened STOP 
START now eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and UNK and she'd have to quit drinking STOP 
START he'd come east for the UNK by god he would STOP 
START when we separated that evening pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into UNK hand to help towards a UNK STOP 
START before he left town pat saw to it that i was fixed up with a job STOP 
START pat had contacts all over the labor movement STOP 
START a friend of UNK named frank UNK had just UNK into the UNK union STOP 
START the UNK were retired UNK and small time UNK off UNK and UNK who acted as UNK on the UNK STOP 
START most of them were elderly men STOP 
START it was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the UNK is awful in the port of new york STOP 
START they weren't as well paid as they should have been STOP 
START one reason the UNK let UNK take them over was to get the protection of his UNK STOP 
START UNK needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the UNK local STOP 
START there i was a retired UNK and structural iron worker UNK never UNK a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement STOP 
START for once UNK was a recommendation STOP 
START UNK couldn't wait to get me hired STOP 
START with my gray hair and my UNK UNK i certainly looked the honest working stiff STOP 
START the things a man will do for a woman STOP

START the next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational UNK STOP 
START on the whole it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way STOP 
START seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn STOP 
START a UNK issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for UNK youth STOP 
START in situations of this sort the board generally UNK the expansion of free education STOP 
START UNK studied the records of UNK school board members in twelve western cities over the period of UNK 40 and found little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence as judged by a panel of professional UNK who studied the voting records on educational issues STOP 
START the few cases of clear UNK along UNK lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for UNK rather than pay increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational policy STOP 
START in general it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society STOP 
START there have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy STOP 
START if there were more such cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the UNK favor their own social classes STOP 
START there is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged STOP 
START this is the issue of segregated schools in the south STOP 
START in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than UNK groups STOP 
START thus the white middle and lower classes are UNK against the negro middle and lower classes STOP 
START this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white UNK people STOP 
START if this happens there may be some class conflict in the south with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position STOP 
START the educational profession the members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position being strongest in the universities STOP 
START they are mostly UNK and UNK people with a few in the upper class STOP 
START do they make UNK decisions a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which UNK and UNK these social values it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society STOP 
START there is no problem here STOP 
START the problem arises if it does arise when the UNK has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence but which bears some relation to the social structure STOP 
START for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously or UNK favor students of one or another social class in deciding on the content and method of his teaching does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger UNK in the race for higher economic status or does he favor a curriculum which UNK students in other ways answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the UNK own UNK position and also upon his social history as well as upon his personality and what he UNK his mission to be as an UNK STOP 
START in a set of case studies of teachers with various UNK UNK UNK UNK a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the UNK personality as well as on his UNK background STOP 
START one UNK teacher may be a hard UNK for UNK pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while another UNK teacher may be a very UNK person with UNK pupils because he knows their UNK and UNK at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment STOP 
START one UNK factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban UNK and UNK families STOP 
START their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers STOP 
START while this influence is a complex matter depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his UNK experience there probably are some general statements about UNK background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth STOP 
START teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them is they are likely to favor a kind of education that has UNK value STOP 
START this does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education as UNK with liberal education but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a UNK UNK value as against a kind of pure liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs STOP 
START there is no doubt that higher education since world war 2 has moved away from pure liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and UNK STOP 
START there are several causes for this one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training STOP 
START but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social UNK STOP 
START compared with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of UNK and more children of urban UNK fathers STOP 
START their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of UNK and UNK UNK parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational UNK in the curriculum STOP 
START the public interest groups educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or UNK appointed to act in the public interest STOP 
START legislators are one such group and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation STOP 
START they generally vote so as to serve their own UNK and if the UNK should be UNK middle class or UNK lower class they might be expected to vote and work for UNK or for UNK interests in education STOP 
START however there are relatively few such political UNK and as has been pointed out there is seldom a UNK distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another STOP 
START another public interest group is the commission of UNK or UNK which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations STOP 
START generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive it STOP 
START nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view STOP 
START for instance there have been two presidential commissions on higher education since world war 2 STOP 
START president UNK commission on higher education tended to take a liberal UNK position while president eisenhower's committee on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative STOP 
START both commissions consisted of UNK and UNK people who attempted to act in the public interest STOP 
START an example of a more definite class UNK is noted in proceedings of the commission on the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of american universities and supported by the rockefeller foundation and the UNK corporation STOP 
START this commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of UNK UNK STOP 
START this might be said to be an UNK or an UNK UNK but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by byron s. UNK entitled who should go to college recommended a federal government scholarship program STOP 
START furthermore the commission set up the council for financial aid to education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education STOP 
START thus the commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education STOP 
START then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments and UNK STOP 
START these people are practically always UNK or UNK persons who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society STOP 
START finally there are the parent organizations and the UNK organizations such as the national association of parents and teachers and the citizens committee on public schools STOP 
START these have an UNK leadership and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where UNK parents are active in local UNK matters STOP 
START like the other UNK groups these are middle class in their educational attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest as they see it STOP 
START in general it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole STOP 
START they are UNK UNK and UNK people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes STOP 
START they may be unaware of the existence of UNK values and consequently fail to take them into account STOP 
START but there is very little frank and conscious UNK of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education STOP 
START they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society STOP 
START attempts to influence social structure through education educational policy in the united states has as an explicit goal the UNK of economic and cultural opportunity STOP 
START in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more fluid artificial barriers to social UNK are reduced and people at the lower end of the social UNK share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society STOP 
START on the other hand there is a UNK purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children STOP 
START this leads to efforts at UNK through private schools and to the maintenance of social UNK in the schools STOP 
START both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions STOP 
START UNK economic and cultural opportunity the broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting UNK within the social structure STOP 
START fifty years ago the general raising of the UNK age to sixteen was an example of this movement STOP 
START during the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities state colleges and community colleges STOP 
START the UNK of american faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the UNK study is another indication of the UNK of the ideal of UNK opportunity through the UNK of educational opportunity STOP 
START the recent federal government's UNK program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to UNK youth STOP 
START it is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records who were usually middle-class and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges STOP 
START meanwhile the private colleges have increased their UNK rates so much that they have raised an economic UNK which UNK their scholarship funds STOP 
START the gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions STOP

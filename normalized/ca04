START UNK the most positive element to emerge from the UNK meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the UNK UNK and wider discussions UNK by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings STOP 
START this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes STOP 
START in UNK the ministers have met in a climate of UNK and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one UNK problems STOP 
START this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the UNK powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems STOP 
START the UNK of a UNK between those in trouble in africa UNK by the difficulties changes and UNK facing them and other allies who UNK and emotionally UNK of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been UNK by its absence STOP 
START explosion avoided in the case of UNK which a few weeks ago was UNK ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its UNK policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable UNK of tension STOP 
START the general remarkably UNK explanation has left basic positions UNK but there has been no explosion in the council STOP 
START there should even be no more bitter UNK in the un general assembly as to nato UNK votes since a new ad UNK nato committee has been set up so that in the future such UNK as UNK will be discussed in advance STOP 
START canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the UNK attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato UNK STOP 
START even UNK despite daily but limited UNK against atomic arms in the heart of this UNK capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line STOP 
START on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for STOP 
START one UNK described the UNK of secretary of state dean UNK speeches as UNK STOP 
START but he UNK to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr. UNK analysis of the various UNK danger points and UNK for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy STOP 
START UNK mood a certain UNK may also be caused by UNK appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a UNK affair with no fewer than six soviet UNK UNK STOP 
START the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr. UNK personal popularity that the united states delegation came to UNK in a somewhat tentative and UNK frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to UNK firm policy on a UNK scale with detailed application to individual danger spots STOP 
START the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months STOP 
START but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only UNK the united UNK profound UNK to the alliance UNK of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at UNK disposal in european waters STOP 
START the secretary of state has also UNK repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another UNK in berlin an UNK once again taken up by the council as a whole STOP 
START conflict UNK the UNK greatest achievement is perhaps the UNK of nato realization that UNK friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection STOP 
START the annual spring meeting has given an UNK in three main directions more deeper and more UNK political UNK within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when UNK as a method of UNK aid to the UNK countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear UNK STOP

START the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring UNK and south viet nam STOP 
START they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this STOP 
START the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated STOP 
START but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility STOP 
START policies modified the UNK here is to accept a de UNK UNK in laos rather than continue to insist on a UNK of the UNK by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference STOP 
START this is another of the UNK of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make STOP 
START it UNK these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration STOP 
START its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas STOP 
START but with the months moving on and the immediate UNK with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist UNK vice-president richard m. nixon in detroit called for a UNK and UNK policy toward the soviet union STOP 
START he was critical of what he feels is president kennedy's tendency to be too UNK STOP 
START gop restrained it does not take a UNK UNK to find out that most republicans in congress feel this UNK the situation as republicans see it STOP 
START they can hardly UNK themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made UNK and UNK UNK in cuba STOP 
START one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the kennedy administration on this score STOP 
START his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now STOP 
START but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first STOP 
START the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator UNK b. morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government UNK of communist domination STOP

START mr. nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific UNK STOP 
START but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries UNK any further arms to cuba that it would not be UNK STOP

START policies on nuclear test UNK negotiations were reviewed and changed STOP 
START but thus far there has been no response in kind STOP 
START foreign aid programs were UNK to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in UNK nations STOP 
START in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast UNK waters as a useless gesture STOP 
START again and again it asked the communists to UNK the military situation in laos STOP 
START but the communists aided the UNK lao at an even faster rate STOP 
START and after several UNK went into UNK lao territory and exposed the huge UNK administration spokesmen UNK them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization STOP 
START UNK was UNK up and prepared UNK plans for UNK with the military losses in laos STOP 
START but the communists never gave sufficient UNK at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an UNK war over laos STOP 
START some UNK nations UNK however STOP

START the administration declared itself in favor of a UNK laos STOP 
START the pro-western government which the united states had helped in a UNK against the UNK UNK UNK government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army STOP

START simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l. UNK a special assistant to the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile UNK and youth crime STOP

START among UNK reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 about half for UNK and UNK involved persons under 18 years of age STOP

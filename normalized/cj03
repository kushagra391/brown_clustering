START a band UNK is shown in figure 2 STOP 
START it consists of two blocks with flat surfaces held apart by UNK STOP 
START there is a small well in the top in which the fluid or UNK to be tested is placed STOP 
START a tape of UNK UNK is pulled between the blocks and the tape UNK the fluid or UNK with it between the parallel faces of the blocks STOP 
START in normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks STOP 
START after it has reached terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a known distance is recorded STOP 
START by the use of various weights data for a UNK of shear graph can be obtained STOP 
START the instrument used for this work was a slight UNK of that previously described STOP 
START in this test a af tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and pulley at a rate of af with a UNK of UNK on each side of the tape STOP 
START this gives a rate of shear of af STOP 
START this however can only be considered approximate as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the UNK of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley during the runs STOP 
START the face of one block contained a hole 1 in diameter which led to a UNK for the measurement of the normal pressure STOP 
START although there were only four fluids tested it was apparent that there were two distinct types STOP 
START two of the fluids showed a UNK normal pressure when undergoing shear and two showed small negative pressures which were UNK in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures generated by the other two STOP 
START figure 3 shows the data on a UNK fluid UNK UNK UNK which gave a high positive normal pressure STOP 
START although the tape was run for over 1 UNK a steady state was not reached and it was concluded that the reason for this was that the back pressure of the UNK was built up from the material fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow rate STOP 
START a system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of the fluid into the UNK if measurements of the normal pressure were to be made in a reasonable time STOP 
START a back pressure was then introduced and the rise or fall of the material in the UNK indicated which was greater the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure STOP 
START by this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted by a sample of UNK molecular weight reported to be UNK was over half an atmosphere STOP 
START the actual pressure was not determined because the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand STOP 
START the two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were UNK with molecular weights which were stated to be UNK and 300 STOP 
START these are fluids which one would expect to be less UNK or more UNK because of their lower molecular weight STOP 
START the maximum UNK was UNK of test fluid measured from the top of the block and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids STOP 
START it is presumed that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor of the assembly since different readings were obtained with the same fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and UNK of the apparatus STOP 
START this negative pressure is not explained by the velocity head af since this is not sufficient to explain the readings by several UNK STOP 
START these experiments can be considered UNK only STOP 
START however they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were UNK by the theory in the first part of the paper STOP 
START they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressures STOP 
START such an instrument would be useful for the UNK of many commercial materials as well as theoretical studies STOP 
START the UNK is a UNK of fluids which is not subject to simple measurement at present and it is a UNK which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial materials STOP 
START such an instrument is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the UNK of heavy UNK such as printing UNK UNK UNK UNK plastics and bread dough for the UNK is related to those various properties termed length UNK UNK etc. which are usually judged by subjective methods at present STOP 
START the actual change af caused by a shear field is calculated by UNK the pressure differential times the volume just as it is for any UNK or UNK pressure head STOP 
START if the volume is the UNK volume then af is obtained on a UNK basis which is the customary UNK of the UNK STOP 
START although the af calculation is obvious by analogy with that for UNK field and UNK pressure it is interesting to confirm it by a method which can be UNK to include related effects STOP 
START consider a shear field with a height of h and a UNK area of a opposed by a UNK with a height of h referred to the same base as h and a UNK area of a STOP 
START if af is the change per unit volume in UNK function caused by the shear field at constant p and t and UNK is the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is af STOP 
START af is the work necessary to fill the UNK column from the reference height to h STOP 
START the total volume of the system above the reference height is af and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in terms of h STOP 
START the minimum total potential energy is found by taking the UNK with respect to h and UNK to zero STOP 
START this gives af which is the pressure STOP 
START this is interesting for it UNK both the UNK concept of a minimum UNK function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium STOP 
START this method can be extended to include the concentration differences caused by shear fields STOP 
START the relation between UNK pressure and the UNK function may also be developed in an UNK way STOP 
START in the above development we have applied the UNK of equilibrium referred to by some as UNK to the steady state STOP 
START this can be justified UNK in this case and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared STOP 
START this has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by UNK that the UNK mechanics of UNK solids can be applied to flowing solutions STOP 
START there is one exception to the above statement as has been pointed out and that is that fluids can relax by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear so the statement should be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar STOP 
START if the mechanics are similar we can also UNK that the UNK will also be similar STOP 
START the concept of the strain energy as a UNK function difference af and UNK a force normal to the UNK face is compatible with the information obtained from optical UNK studies of fluids undergoing shear STOP 
START essentially these UNK studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at UNK to the direction of shear and as the rate of shear increases the direction of the maximum tension moves UNK toward the direction of shear STOP 
START according to UNK the UNK shear s is given by af where UNK is the angle of UNK STOP 
START from this and the force of UNK it should be possible to UNK the UNK energy of UNK which should be equal to the af calculated from the pressure normal to the UNK face STOP 
START there is another means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses in UNK fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low UNK fluids in shear fields STOP 
START these UNK are distorted by the normal forces just as a UNK would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's hands STOP 
START these UNK appear to be UNK and it is UNK convenient to assume that they are STOP 
START if they are not UNK the conclusions will be a reasonable UNK STOP 
START the direction of the tension of minimum pressure is of course given by the direction of the major axis of the UNK STOP 
START mason and taylor both show that the major axis of the UNK is at UNK at low rates of shear and that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear STOP 
START some UNK break up before they are near to the direction of shear and some become UNK to it without UNK STOP 
START this is of course a similar type of behavior to that indicated by UNK studies STOP 
START the relative forces can be calculated from the various UNK of UNK if we assume a the surface tension is uniform on the surface of the drop STOP 
START b that because of the low UNK of the fluid the internal pressure is the same in all directions STOP 
START c the UNK effects are UNK STOP 
START d since the shape of the drop UNK to the force field it does not UNK affect the distribution of forces in the fluid STOP 
START these are reasonable assumptions with low UNK fluids suspended in high UNK fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear STOP 
START just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a UNK drop is af and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is af the pressure exerted by any UNK surface is af where UNK is the UNK tension and af and af are the two UNK of UNK STOP 
START this formula is given by UNK and mason STOP 
START if a is the major axis of an UNK and b and c are the other two UNK the UNK of UNK in the UNK plane at the end of the axis af and the difference in pressure along the a and b UNK is af STOP 
START there are no data published in the literature on the shape of low UNK drops to confirm the above formulas STOP 
START however there are photographs of suspended drops of UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK suspended in corn UNK of UNK UNK in a paper by mason and UNK STOP 
START this UNK of the material in the drops is of course not UNK STOP 
START measurements on the photograph in this paper give af at the maximum rate of shear of af STOP 
START if it is assumed that the formula given by lodge of UNK af applies the pressure difference along the major UNK can be calculated from the angle of UNK of the major axis and from this the UNK tension can be calculated STOP 
START its value was af from the above data STOP 
START this appears to be high as would be expected from the UNK UNK of the material in the drops STOP 
START it is appropriate to call attention to certain UNK properties of an ideal gas that are UNK to UNK UNK STOP 
START the internal energy of an ideal gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume STOP 
START in other words if an ideal gas is UNK and kept at constant temperature the work done in UNK it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink STOP 
START this means that work UNK q which in turn UNK af STOP 
START there is a well-known relationship between probability and UNK which states that af where UNK is the probability that state i.e. volume for an ideal gas could be reached by chance alone STOP 
START this is known as UNK UNK STOP 
START this UNK UNK is in this case equal to the usual UNK for there are no other changes or other energies involved STOP 
START note that though the ideal gas itself contains no additional energy the UNK gas does exert an increased pressure STOP 
START the energy for any UNK work done by the perfect gas must come as thermal energy from its UNK STOP

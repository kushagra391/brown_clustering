START the fall of rome the discovery of precious UNK and the protestant UNK were all UNK and could only be explained and understood by UNK the UNK that preceded and those that followed STOP 
START often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct by those individuals or nations which he is studying STOP 
START UNK governments or races or institutions may enter into some UNK without fully realizing why they are doing so STOP 
START they react in UNK to an instinct or urge which has itself been UNK by natural law STOP 
START a court may strike down a law on the basis of an UNK feeling that the law is UNK to the numerical majority STOP 
START a nation may go to war on some UNK UNK when in reality it may have been guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake STOP 
START when the historian UNK a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible UNK STOP 
START adams firmly contended that the historian must never UNK the impact of the geographical environment on history STOP 
START here was another indispensable tool STOP 
START indeed he concluded that geographical conditions have exercised a great possibly a UNK influence over man's destiny STOP 
START the failure of greece to reach the imperial destiny that UNK UNK had seemed to promise was almost directly UNK to her physical UNK STOP 
START all areas of history were either favorably or UNK affected by the geographical environment and no respectable historian could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of UNK STOP 
START brooks adams was consistent in his UNK to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess STOP 
START however as a practicing historian he himself has left few UNK to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing history STOP 
START in fact if judgments are to be rendered upon the UNK of his UNK they must be based on UNK evidence STOP 
START what evidence is available would seem to indicate that brooks unlike his older brother henry had most of the UNK UNK usually found in the amateur STOP 
START a UNK a UNK for UNK an UNK UNK on contemporary accounts and a UNK to assume a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all UNK of his failure to UNK the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public STOP 
START this is not to assume that his work was without merit but the validity of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be considered against this background of an UNK approach STOP 
START his UNK is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to the emancipation of massachusetts which UNK to examine the trials of UNK and to draw a parallel between the leader of the UNK UNK from egypt and the leadership of the UNK clergy in colonial new england STOP 
START much criticism has been leveled at this rather forced analogy but what is equally significant is UNK complete acceptance of the biblical record as good and UNK history STOP 
START in light of the UNK UNK UNK by the higher criticism this is a most remarkable statement particularly coming from one who was well known for his UNK views STOP 
START the desire to UNK a UNK at the expense of sound research technique UNK more of the UNK than the historian STOP 
START a similar UNK characteristic is revealed in UNK failure to check the accuracy and UNK of his UNK sources STOP 
START if he found data that fitted his general plan he used it and counted his sources UNK STOP 
START UNK if statistics were UNK which UNK a cherished theory the sources were UNK as UNK STOP 
START such UNK are frequently encountered in his essay on the UNK of the UNK during the english UNK STOP 
START adams UNK largely on the UNK of foreign UNK and observers in england claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because there were no newspapers STOP 
START this is certainly an UNK UNK in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth century on UNK terms STOP 
START moreover he rejects the contemporary accounts of UNK casually UNK them to be distorted by prejudice because the opinions of UNK are of no great value STOP 
START what is UNK by this observation is not the inherent UNK of UNK but the UNK of brooks adams STOP 
START in all UNK it must be admitted that adams made no UNK at being an UNK historian STOP 
START UNK to him meant an UNK to UNK and to search for a synthesis STOP 
START he UNK the impact of german UNK on the writing of history UNK it a UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK and his UNK had reduced history to a profession of UNK adams preferred the UNK of UNK or the style and UNK of edward UNK for at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote STOP 
START he wrote UNK to william james that UNK history was not only impossible but UNK STOP 
START if the historian was convinced of his own UNK then he should not allow his vision to become UNK by disturbing facts STOP 
START it was history that must be in error not the historian STOP 
START it was this basic UNK that separated adams from the ranks of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what was his most serious UNK against the historical method namely the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before UNK it to the test of facts STOP 
START all of UNK work reflects this UNK characteristic STOP 
START no page seems to be complete without the statement of at least one UNK UNK STOP 
START one example of this was his UNK that all UNK UNK must be dealt with by physical force STOP 
START there is no explanation of terms nor a UNK that most such UNK have been dealt with by force only a UNK UNK that they must because of some UNK UNK be so UNK STOP 
START on matters of race he was similarly UNK most of the modern latin races seem to have inherited the UNK of the roman mind STOP 
START he UNK the french revolution as UNK this UNK but makes no mention of the UNK who have been able to UNK to all types of circumstances STOP 
START he UNK that one of the first signs of UNK civilization is the fall in the value of women in men's eyes STOP 
START it made no difference that most evidence points to an opposite conclusion STOP 
START for adams had made up his mind before all the facts were available STOP 
START all critics of adams and his methods have observed this particular deficiency STOP 
START j. t. UNK was UNK by such UNK history as that which attributed the fall of the UNK empire to the UNK trade and he urged adams to UNK his essay into a real history UNK not merely those facts which fit into his theory but also the UNK and exceptions STOP 
START a. m. UNK called the adams method literally UNK while UNK day maintained that the assumptions were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight UNK evidence STOP 
START moreover stated day he always UNK facts which tend to UNK his hypothesis STOP 
START even d. a. UNK who compared the emancipation of massachusetts to the UNK of a fog from ancient UNK was also forced to admit the UNK UNK of the author STOP 
START in summary brooks adams felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature STOP 
START moreover he believed that most professional historians lacked some of the essential instruments for a proper study of history STOP 
START however despite the insight of many of his observations his own conclusions are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the correct research methods STOP 
START this should not prejudice an evaluation of his findings but they were not the findings of a completely UNK UNK STOP 
START what was perhaps more important than his concept of the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which shaped the direction of his thought STOP 
START in the final analysis his contribution to american UNK was founded on almost UNK insights into religion economics and UNK the three factors which conditioned his search for a law of history STOP 
START religion without UNK brooks adams considered religion as an extremely significant UNK of man's fear of the unknown STOP 
START but it was nothing more than that STOP 
START religion and the churches were institutions which had been created by man not god STOP 
START he did not deny god simply did not believe that a creator UNK or UNK in human affairs STOP 
START the historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems suggested by religion STOP 
START there was no evidence either of a positive or negative type of the actions of a divine being in this world since the historian should only be interested in strictly UNK activity his research should eliminate the supernatural STOP 
START furthermore he must regard religion as the expression of human forces STOP 
START certainly he must recognize its power and attempt to UNK its influence on the flow of history but he must not UNK the natural and the UNK with the divine STOP 
START adams was not breaking new ground when he claimed that the worship of an UNK power was in reality a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment STOP 
START students of UNK and comparative religion had long been aware that there was indeed a direct connection STOP 
START but adams was one of the first to suggest that this human UNK was the only UNK factor behind religion STOP 
START it was this fear which explained the development of a UNK UNK whose function in society was to UNK and UNK the angry UNK STOP 
START to keep themselves UNK in power the priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle STOP 
START it was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business STOP 
START the german UNK of the fourth century offered an excellent example the germans in the fourth century were a very simple race who UNK little of natural laws and who therefore referred phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention STOP 
START this intervention could only be controlled by priests and thus the UNK caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class STOP 
START the power of every UNK organization has always rested on the miracle and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as did UNK STOP 
START adams contended that once such a special class had been created it became a UNK interest and sought to maintain itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between god and man STOP 
START thus the church was born and because of its UNK character was soon identified as a conservative institution determined to resist the forces of change to identify itself with the political UNK and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses STOP 
START doctrine was not only mysterious was also sacred and no UNK in an inspired church could UNK having her UNK examined as we should examine human laws STOP 
START these basic ideas concerning the nature of religion were adams believed some of the major keys to the understanding of history and the movement of society STOP 
START the dark views about the UNK found in the emancipation of massachusetts were never altered STOP 
START despite their UNK to the status quo the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments as increasing civilization UNK human knowledge STOP 
START in the law of civilization and decay brooks adams traced this evolution always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more rational the substance remained UNK STOP 
START the UNK worship and UNK of the middle ages were more advanced forms than were primitive UNK worship and nature UNK STOP 
START yet the idea UNK in each was identical to UNK the unknown with mystery and to UNK that class which had been given special UNK over the secrets of god STOP 
START to adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire culture of the race was one of imagination and it is largely the UNK he so obviously held for such UNK that UNK a peculiar UNK a sentiment he would have probably denied STOP

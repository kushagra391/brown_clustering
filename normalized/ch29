START in recent months much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current UNK in business and UNK are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future STOP 
START and yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade 1960 has been a good year in many ways with many overall measures of business having reached new UNK for the year as a whole STOP 
START the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing in that it has prevented the accumulation of the UNK inventories that have characterized many previous UNK in the business cycle STOP 
START this caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of UNK and UNK to shift the inventory burden back on the UNK and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level STOP 
START in the electronics industry this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of tv sets STOP 
START factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years while those at retail are below 1959 STOP 
START the total value of our industry's shipments at factory prices increased from UNK billion in 1959 to approximately UNK billion as a result of increases in all of the major UNK of our business home entertainment military industrial and replacement STOP 
START i believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 STOP 
START home entertainment sales up reflecting the largest percentage of UNK sets such as UNK and combinations since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about UNK billion compared to UNK billion in 1959 STOP 
START sales of tv sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through july production excluding those UNK for the UNK market also ran ahead in the early months but was UNK after the usual vacation UNK in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been UNK optimistic STOP 
START for the year as a whole retail sales of tv sets probably came to UNK million against UNK million in 1959 production came to only UNK million compared to UNK million STOP 
START in contrast to the lower UNK of tv total radio production increased from UNK million sets to UNK million excluding UNK STOP 
START both home and auto UNK were in excellent demand with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven and production of home sets were about equal at UNK million units STOP 
START auto set production came to about UNK million compared to UNK million in 1959 STOP 
START separate UNK also had a good year reflecting the growing popularity of UNK sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to UNK that characterized the UNK market STOP 
START the outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of UNK to step up their buying plans for durable goods STOP 
START i would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 UNK but that UNK levels should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent UNK suggest they will STOP 
START i look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at UNK million sets for the year but i look for some decline in UNK from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of UNK UNK million sets STOP 
START i therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about UNK million slightly below 1960 but above 1959 STOP 
START military electronics to grow 1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics which UNK about UNK billion compared to UNK billion in 1959 STOP 
START it is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in UNK which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance STOP 
START it has been correctly pointed out by UNK people in the industry that it is probably UNK to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of UNK or better that characterized the decade of the UNK and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still UNK areas of our defense capability STOP 
START while this may well be true in general i believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions STOP 
START among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the UNK and UNK programs strengthening of the UNK alert system of the strategic air command and improved UNK UNK systems STOP 
START research and development expenditures connected with the UNK UNK UNK and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as UNK are expected to increase substantially STOP 
START research development test and evaluation funds devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by UNK STOP 
START still later the realm of space technology will show substantial gains has been estimated that spending by the national UNK and space administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than UNK billion by UNK and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current UNK STOP 
START the UNK defense procurement called for in the 1961 budget has already begun to make itself felt in an UNK in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it and it has been suggested that an additional UNK billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 STOP 
START although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual on balance i look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year to at least UNK billion STOP 
START industrial electronic equipment paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment UNK UNK billion compared to UNK billion in 1959 STOP 
START the market for UNK and other UNK continues to expand at the rate of about UNK annually reaching some UNK million in 1960 STOP 
START informed estimates look for this market to approximately UNK by the late UNK under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of UNK and UNK industrial process control and information storage and UNK STOP 
START in the industrial field prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright STOP 
START for the near term however it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market and for this reason i would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years should slightly exceed 1960 however and reach UNK billion STOP 
START replacement parts in addition to the three major original equipment UNK of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year STOP 
START this is now a UNK billion business up from UNK billion in 1959 and should reach UNK billion in 1961 STOP 
START the markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment UNK of the industry STOP 
START demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates STOP 
START in the military field UNK orders turned down early in the year and remained rather slow until late fall when the UNK in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components STOP 
START sales of UNK in 1960 UNK UNK million compared to UNK million in 1959 despite substantial price UNK in virtually all types STOP 
START production UNK about UNK million units against UNK million in 1959 and i look for a further gain to UNK million units worth approximately UNK million in 1961 STOP 
START sales of passive components such as UNK and UNK although not growing as fast as those of UNK were ahead of 1959 this year and should increase again in 1961 STOP 
START in sum i look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with total sales increasing about UNK to UNK billion despite the UNK in the business outlook generally STOP 
START as i have indicated above i base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the UNK figures close to those of 1960 prospects for continued increases in defense spending on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the UNK STOP

START he started practice in UNK and served on the state board of medical UNK STOP 
START giving up the violin opened a whole new career for UNK UNK a tiny UNK who UNK UNK had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage STOP 
START a heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the UNK daily practicing STOP 
START she put the violin away and took out some UNK UNK and yarn to while away the long idle days in UNK STOP 
START now her modern UNK have been UNK on two UNK and at 26 she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in los angeles STOP 
START her days as an art student at the university of UNK came to a sudden end during the UNK UNK in 1957 and she and her husband stephen fled to vienna STOP 
START there they continued their studies at the university she in art he in architecture STOP 
START and there she had her first showing of UNK work STOP 
START there's a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today STOP 
START what most people don't seem to realize if they aren't tied up with the thing as i am is that UNK of the problem is transportation STOP 
START i never dreamed of the UNK difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school STOP 
START it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a UNK day in their yellow UNK to UNK at the UNK school STOP 
START getting to and from school was no problem STOP 
START they either walked or were driven STOP 
START now they go to a high school that is two miles away STOP 
START one might think the problem would be similar STOP 
START they could walk ride on a bus or be driven STOP 
START it's much more complex than that STOP 
START generally they go to school with a girl named UNK who lives down the block and has a car STOP 
START this is a way of getting to school but i understand it UNK a certain loss of social status STOP 
START a young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is and is also a girl STOP 
START why don't you walk to school then suggested STOP 
START my father walked through two miles of snow in illinois STOP 
START did you was asked STOP 
START no i said i didn't happen to grow up in illinois STOP 
START i explained however that i had my share of UNK in making my daily UNK to the feet of wisdom STOP 
START i had to ride a streetcar two miles STOP 
START sometimes the streetcar was late STOP 
START sometimes there weren't even any seats STOP 
START i had to stand up with the ladies STOP 
START sometimes i got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other UNK place and had to spend the day there STOP 
START i've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then STOP 
START when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car STOP 
START she has to have at least one car herself STOP 
START i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman STOP 
START even that isn't satisfactory STOP 
START if they have to take any car they'd rather take the big one STOP 
START they say that when they take a car UNK doesn't take her car but UNK with them STOP 
START but when UNK UNK with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car isn't big enough STOP 
START the logic of that is UNK of course except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself STOP 
START the solution naturally is the bus STOP 
START however it's a UNK walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and it's too hard on my legs STOP 
START my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there STOP 
START but that's hardly realistic STOP 
START nobody walks UNK but UNK and harry truman and he's already got an education STOP 
START advance publicity on the los angeles blue book does not mention names dropped as did the UNK for the new york social register which made news last week STOP 
START published annually by william UNK richardson the 1962 edition UNK society register of southern california is scheduled to arrive with monday UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK richardson has UNK the blue book but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those UNK telephone numbers addresses other UNK club UNK and marriages STOP 
START stars for marriage stars throughout the volume UNK dates of marriages during the past year STOP 
START last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of meredith jane cooper daughter of the grant b. UNK to robert UNK UNK and of mary alice UNK to UNK pen UNK STOP 
START others are carla ruth UNK to dan UNK chandler jr. UNK daughter of the UNK UNK to james UNK UNK and UNK smith to james UNK UNK STOP 
START also noted are the marriages of elizabeth UNK daughter of the george l. UNK to austin c. smith jr. flower daughter of the UNK flowers jr. to UNK UNK son of the david UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK listed as newly UNK in the UNK section of the new book are mr. and mrs. samuel UNK UNK 3 STOP 
START she is the former UNK UNK daughter of john s. UNK of this city STOP 
START the young couple live in UNK STOP 
START another marriage of note is that of jane UNK and william louis UNK STOP 
START changes in address are noted STOP 
START for instance the edwin UNK jr. formerly of UNK UNK are now at home on north UNK dr. in beverly hills STOP 
START mr. and mrs. robert UNK now live on UNK and the franklin UNK on s. UNK UNK STOP 
START the richard UNK formerly of connecticut have returned to southern california and are now UNK on south UNK UNK STOP 
START but the UNK UNK have UNK their residence in southern california for mexico city STOP 
START more new addresses judge and mrs. UNK hazard are now at UNK beach while the frank UNK have moved from beverly hills to new york where he is general manager of the UNK hotel STOP 
START and lawrence chase son of the UNK UNK is listed at his new address in oxford UNK STOP 
START others listed at new addresses are the richard t. UNK the joseph UNK jr. the henri de la UNK the john UNK and dr. and mrs. UNK UNK the john UNK the allen UNK the howard UNK the thomas UNK and anthony UNK STOP 
START UNK of social note from other parts of the country are the ray UNK formerly of UNK UNK UNK formerly of scotland and mr. and mrs. UNK h. UNK formerly of switzerland STOP 
START here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to UNK and is completely charming using UNK for lamp bases STOP 
START most children love the UNK UNK faces and their flexible bodies and they prefer to see them as though the UNK were in action rather than put away in boxes STOP 
START displayed as UNK the UNK delight the children and are UNK UNK STOP 
START to create such a lamp order a wired UNK from any lamp shop STOP 
START measure the UNK to determine the height of the light UNK allowing three to four inches above the UNK head STOP 
START make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an UNK l the foot of the l about three inches long so that the UNK can hang directly under the light STOP 
START pulling strings using the strings that UNK the UNK UNK him from the light UNK by UNK the strings to the lamp base STOP 
START in this way you can UNK his legs and arms in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on the UNK STOP 
START if the UNK are of uniform size you can change them in UNK with your child's UNK STOP 
START although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the UNK could be changed without UNK it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's UNK STOP 
START those illustrated are UNK of a UNK top or a UNK STOP 
START the UNK edge is particularly appealing STOP 
START today's trend toward furniture designs from america's past is teaching UNK and UNK a renewed respect for the UNK UNK of our colonial era STOP 
START a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated UNK and fine UNK STOP 
START in the background UNK the feeling however that these pieces beautiful as they were lacked the UNK touch STOP 
START so UNK bedroom was usually UNK out with heavy UNK pieces that supposedly could take the hard UNK while the fine secretary was UNK to the parlor where it was for show only STOP 
START this isn't true of the many UNK of the UNK according to UNK consultant UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs says mr. UNK and they are doing it largely because colonial UNK had an UNK sense of the practical STOP 
START solid investment there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop down to earth designs or go out of business STOP

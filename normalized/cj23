START 2 of the major functions of religion the place of religion in the simple UNK societies is quite definite a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions UNK in every part of it STOP 
START in societies like ours however its place is less clear and more complex STOP 
START with the diversity of religious UNK there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion STOP 
START nevertheless for most of the population of UNK advanced societies though less for the less religious portion religion does perform certain UNK individual and social functions STOP 
START although the inner functions of religion are not of direct significance in social organization they have important indirect consequences STOP 
START if the inner functions of religion are performed the individual is a composed ordered UNK and emotionally secure associate is not greatly UNK and he is not UNK is better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows STOP 
START there are several closely related inner functions STOP 
START in the last analysis religion is the means of UNK UNK expressing UNK UNK and UNK man's deepest experience the religious STOP 
START man is first religious UNK follow STOP 
START religion UNK to satisfy human needs of great UNK STOP 
START the significant things in it at the higher religious levels are the inner emotional mental and spiritual UNK that fill the pressing human needs of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the chief experience is the UNK of communion and in the higher religions of a UNK relationship with the supernatural power STOP 
START related to this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively secure in an ordered UNK universe STOP 
START man has the experience of being UNK allied with what he cannot fully understand is a UNK part of all of the mysterious energy and being and movement STOP 
START the universe is a safe and permanent home STOP 
START a number of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the ultimate and eternal STOP 
START death is not permanent defeat and UNK has a second chance STOP 
START he is not lost in the UNK of endless time has endless being STOP 
START religion at its best also offers the experience of spiritual fulfillment by UNK man into the highest realm of the spirit STOP 
START religion can UNK UNK UNK and UNK all the highest ideals and values ethical aesthetic and religious of man formed in his culture STOP 
START there is also the possibility among higher religions of UNK consistent meaning in life and enjoying guidance and UNK STOP 
START the kind of religious experience that most UNK seek not only provides UNK and UNK human UNK values ideals and purposes also provides facilities and UNK for the development of personality UNK and UNK STOP 
START under the religious impulse whether UNK or UNK men have joy in living leads somewhere STOP 
START religion at its best is out in front ever UNK and leading on and as UNK put it UNK all man's scattered energies in one UNK sense of his own infinite importance STOP 
START at the same time that religion UNK the individual UNK to the supernatural and gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment it also has great therapeutic value for him STOP 
START it gives him aid comfort even UNK in meeting UNK life situations where his own UNK practical knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate STOP 
START he is confronted with the UNK crises such as great natural UNK and the great UNK of life marriage UNK disease UNK old age the certainty of death STOP 
START he has to cope with frustration and other emotional UNK and UNK STOP 
START his religious beliefs provide him with UNK explanations for many conditions which cause him great concern and his religious faith makes possible UNK UNK and UNK enabling him to UNK UNK UNK fear frustration uncertainty suffering evil and danger STOP 
START religion usually also includes a principle of compensation mainly in a promised perfect future state STOP 
START the belief in immortality where held functions as a UNK for the UNK and UNK of the here and now STOP 
START the tensions accompanying a UNK consciousness of UNK or UNK or some UNK secret are relieved for the less UNK or UNK by confession UNK and UNK STOP 
START the feeling of individual UNK defeat or UNK growing out of various social situations or individual UNK or UNK is UNK for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly but UNK UNK as well as by sympathetic fellowship with others who share this faith and by opportunities in religious acts for giving UNK to emotions and energies STOP 
START in providing for these inner individual functions religion UNK in behalf of individual peace of mind and UNK services for which there is no other institution STOP 
START in addition to the functions of religion within man there have always been the outer social functions for the community and society STOP 
START the two have never been UNK STOP 
START religion is UNK necessary in both UNK maintenance and regulation STOP 
START the UNK of a community or society is always UNK with and to a degree dependent upon a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions STOP 
START the religion supports UNK UNK and maintains the fundamental values STOP 
START even in the united states with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast UNK UNK there is a general UNK regarding the basic christian values STOP 
START this is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere example americans UNK to christian values UNK those of UNK communism STOP 
START in america also all of our major religious bodies officially sanction a UNK UNK which is UNK of our common religion STOP 
START even the UNK members the UNK marginal UNK and so on have the values of christian civilization UNK in them STOP 
START furthermore religion tends to UNK the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of god to the UNK and UNK values example those regarding material objects and UNK ends STOP 
START finally it gives UNK more than human UNK and even through UNK reference UNK and supernatural importance to some values example marriage as a UNK much UNK as UNK occasionally the state as a divine instrument STOP 
START it places certain values at least beyond questioning and UNK STOP 
START closely related to this function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate ends for the society which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends STOP 
START this something leads to a conception of an over-all social plan with a meaning UNK in terms of ultimate ends example a plan that UNK the will of god which advances the kingdom of god which involves social life as part of the grand design STOP 
START this explains some group ends and provides a justification of their UNK STOP 
START it gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs of social action STOP 
START finally it gives meaning to much social UNK and logic consistency and meaning to life STOP 
START in general there is no society so UNK as to be completely without UNK inspired UNK ends STOP 
START religion UNK and UNK STOP 
START some of the oldest most persistent and most cohesive forms of social UNK have grown out of religion STOP 
START these groups have varied widely from mere families primitive UNK groups and small modern UNK and UNK to the UNK of great denominations and great widely UNK world religions STOP 
START religion UNK group life in various ways STOP 
START the common ultimate values ends and goals UNK by religion are a most important factor STOP 
START without a system of values there can be no society STOP 
START where such a value system UNK it always UNK all who possess it UNK members of the society to operate as a system STOP 
START the beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed in UNK UNK and UNK and form what UNK calls a UNK STOP 
START as he points out a religious group cannot exist without a collective UNK and the more extensive the UNK the more unified and strong is the group STOP 
START the UNK UNK and UNK men by UNK them completely to an identical body of doctrine more extensive and firm the body of doctrine the UNK the group STOP 
START the religious UNK and especially the closely related UNK and worship forms constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith STOP 
START the religion in fact is an expression of the unity of the group small or large STOP 
START the common codes for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior UNK the UNK together STOP 
START these are ways of UNK participating in significantly symbolized UNK and ordered UNK UNK behavior STOP 
START the codes are mechanism for training in and UNK and UNK uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly UNK the solidarity of the group STOP 
START UNK noted long ago that religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things UNK into one single moral community all those who UNK to them STOP 
START his view is that every religion UNK to a community and UNK every community is in one aspect a religious unit STOP 
START this is brought out in the common religious UNK that UNK even in the UNK diverse audiences at many secular UNK and public occasions in the united states it is evidenced in the prayers offered in the frequent religious UNK and in the UNK of points on religious grounds STOP 
START the UNK effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units with religion as the dominant bond even though UNK UNK and not politically organized STOP 
START the jews for UNK years have been a prime example though the UNK of any world or UNK religion are cases in point STOP 
START it might be pointed out that the UNK function of religion for good or ill has often supported or been identified with other UNK political UNK language class racial UNK even economic STOP 
START religion usually exercises a UNK function STOP 
START as such it acts as an anchor for the people STOP 
START there is a marked tendency for religions once firmly established to resist change not only in their own UNK and policies and practices but also in secular affairs having religious UNK STOP 
START it has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of social values though also in some measure an UNK to the creation or diffusion of new ones STOP 
START it tends to support the UNK precious UNK the traditional ways of thinking and the customary ways of living STOP 
START as UNK has pointed out the UNK on symbols on tradition on sacred writings on the UNK of emotional feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values turns one to the past far more than to the future STOP 
START historically religion has also UNK as a tremendous engine of UNK enforcement sanction and UNK of various other institutions STOP 
START at the same time that religion exercises a UNK influence it also UNK and UNK both individuals and groups STOP 
START much of the important individual and social action has been UNK to religious UNK STOP 
START the great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent UNK lights that UNK people toward them with an almost UNK force UNK energies and UNK UNK example the UNK mission efforts just wars STOP 
START much effort has been expended in the sincere effort to apply the teaching and UNK of religion STOP 
START the UNK reward systems that most religions UNK have great UNK effects STOP 
START religion provides the most attractive UNK either in this world or the next for those who not merely UNK by its norms but who engage in good works STOP 
START religion usually acts as a powerful aid in social control UNK what men should or should not do STOP 
START among primitive peoples the UNK and UNK of religion were more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group in modern societies such influence is still great STOP 
START religion has its own supernatural UNK that are at the same time codes of behavior for the here and now STOP

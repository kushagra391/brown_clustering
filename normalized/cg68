START from UNK on if the lists exist they contain between twenty to thirty names STOP 
START as the total number of UNK UNK in UNK was according to UNK life UNK and n two hundred UNK the twenty-four names listed in the UNK UNK for that year constitute slightly less than one UNK of the total number of UNK who then UNK STOP 
START there were four from st. john's and four from christ's three from UNK and two from each of the colleges jesus UNK UNK and UNK with UNK UNK king's UNK and UNK supplying one each in the UNK UNK STOP 
START the list was headed by henry UNK of st. john's who was UNK from st. john's at easter UNK STOP 
START he became a fellow of jesus in UNK proceeded UNK from jesus in UNK and was UNK in UNK STOP 
START the second name was edward UNK UNK from UNK college at easter UNK STOP 
START he proceeded UNK in UNK and UNK in UNK being made fellow in UNK STOP 
START he was UNK UNK 16 june and priest 22 december UNK STOP 
START the third name was john UNK who was admitted to the inner temple in november UNK STOP 
START the fourth name was john milton of christ's college followed by richard UNK of UNK who UNK 16 october UNK STOP 
START UNK gave his UNK as UNK a mistake for UNK STOP 
START UNK also proceeded UNK in UNK and became a fellow of his college in that year STOP 
START john UNK of christ's was UNK in the list coming from UNK school under mr. UNK as UNK 20 april UNK under mr. UNK STOP 
START the UNK name was richard UNK written UNK admitted to christ's college under scott 2 july UNK STOP 
START the UNK name was thomas UNK admitted to christ's 4 march UNK under UNK STOP 
START christ's college was well represented that year in the UNK and the name highest on the list from that college was UNK fourth in the entire university STOP 
START small wonder that milton later UNK of how well his work had been received there since he UNK a rank in the order of UNK UNK higher than that of any other UNK from christ's of that year STOP 
START it is not possible to UNK fully the arrangements whereby these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they contained assumed the order in which we find them STOP 
START the process usually began with a UNK UNK about a boy as UNK had UNK about UNK to the higher officers of the college and university STOP 
START then the various officers of the college might take up the case STOP 
START it would however reach the UNK and other officers in charge of the UNK performances of the UNK UNK and the place that any individual obtained in the lists UNK greatly on how he UNK himself in the public schools during his acts UNK as he was UNK STOP 
START of course the higher officials could add or place a name on the list wherever they wished STOP 
START UNK name being fourth is neither too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of UNK UNK master or other mighty hand STOP 
START he evidently earned the place assigned him STOP 
START UNK of UNK undergraduate career looking back from the spring of UNK over the four years of UNK undergraduate days certain phases of his college career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us STOP 
START of course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of education he received STOP 
START it differed from what an undergraduate receives today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely scattered information obtained today by most of our UNK STOP 
START milton was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge of latin UNK UNK ethics physics or natural philosophy metaphysics and latin greek and UNK STOP 
START he had also UNK various special fields of learning being unable to miss some study of UNK UNK law and UNK medicine STOP 
START above all he had learned to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of UNK STOP 
START he had learned to dispute UNK both formally and UNK in latin and according to the rules on any UNK pro or UNK drawn from almost any subject more especially from UNK works STOP 
START he could produce carefully constructed UNK set and formal speeches UNK and UNK made by writing and UNK with all the aid his UNK and others could provide and then delivered UNK from memory STOP 
START he had also learned to dispute UNK remarkably well the main evidence for which of course is the presence of his name in the honors list of UNK STOP 
START he also displayed the ability to write latin verse on almost any UNK of dispute the UNK of course to be delivered from memory STOP 
START then we have surviving at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in UNK UNK UNK UNK and perhaps also the de idea UNK STOP 
START but his greatest achievement in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues and teachers was his amazing ability to produce literary latin pieces and he was often called on to do so STOP 
START these were his public academic activities UNK UNK in the college and in the university STOP 
START and his performances attracted much attention as the frequency of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his undergraduate activities UNK STOP 
START his other activities are not so easily UNK STOP 
START his statements about sports and exercises of a physical nature are UNK but UNK STOP 
START his later UNK of his skill with the small UNK are UNK of much time and practice devoted to the use of that weapon STOP 
START UNK and others have dealt with sports and UNK at cambridge in UNK day with not very specific results STOP 
START milton himself UNK as he is about his lesser and UNK activities at least gives us some evidence that he was a great walker under any and all conditions STOP 
START his early poems and some of his prose UNK speak of UNK in the city and the neighboring country that may be extended to cambridge and its surrounding UNK STOP 
START the town itself and the UNK UNK he often visited as did all in the university STOP 
START the churches the UNK and the various other places of the town must have known his figure well as he UNK to and about them STOP 
START the tiny UNK of UNK to the north with the UNK and UNK lying on down the UNK river may have attracted him often as it did many other youths of the time STOP 
START the UNK UNK hills to the southeast afforded him and all other students a UNK point from which to view the town and university of their dwelling STOP 
START the country about cambridge is flat and not particularly spectacular in its scenery though it offers easy going to the foot UNK STOP 
START ball games especially football required some attention and other organized sports may have attracted him as UNK or UNK STOP 
START he UNK as did everybody and UNK the various UNK UNK of that day although his UNK while at cambridge and after that he was no UNK point to reasonable UNK from the wild drinking UNK of some of the UNK and we must add of some of their UNK including many of the UNK or teachers STOP 
START what manner of person does milton appear to have been when as an undergraduate he UNK at christ's college was then a slightly built young man of UNK appearance medium stature and handsome face STOP 
START UNK as his UNK and dancing lessons had taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight UNK frame he cut enough of a figure to have UNK a UNK in the college to which he himself referred in UNK 6 UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START that is if we can trust that most UNK of UNK packed as it is with wit and UNK STOP 
START the UNK sounds real enough if we could only trust the conditions under which we learn of its use anyone who would put much trust in any phase of UNK 6 except its UNK UNK deserves whatever fate may be UNK out to him by virtue of the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START in short the traditional UNK for milton of lady of christ's while UNK fitting rests only on this UNK passage in the midst of the most UNK piece of writing milton left us STOP 
START UNK mention of it UNK and UNK UNK UNK 8 f. UNK comes from this UNK through UNK milton or edward phillips STOP 
START it is not a question of truth or UNK UNK in which the UNK statement about the UNK occurs is such a mass of UNK buried UNK that almost nothing in it can be accepted as true or UNK as false STOP 
START the entire exercise latin and english is most UNK of the kind of person milton had become at christ's during his undergraduate career mere fact that he was selected though as a substitute to act as UNK or UNK for it or perhaps we should say with buck as father of the act is in itself a difficult phase of his development to grasp STOP 
START milton was to act as the UNK the supreme wit the lightly UNK UNK UNK UNK who could at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment or could at will UNK the common enemies of the college gathering and with words alone STOP 
START from an exercise involving merely UNK UNK comedy in his hands the performance turned into a UNK of wit and word play UNK at times but always learned pointed and carefully aimed at some individuals present and at the whole assembly STOP 
START to do this successfully required great skill and a special talent for both solemn and UNK UNK a talent not UNK on many persons but one with which milton was marked as being UNK and in which at least in this performance he obviously UNK STOP 
START it may be thought unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform if again we may trust the opening of the UNK for it marks the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of UNK word play that even in this latin UNK has in it the UNK element of UNK and an almost UNK delight in UNK UNK an UNK STOP 
START but the real UNK of this development in him go back to the opposing of UNK school and probably if it had not been this occasion and these latin lines it would have been some others such as the first UNK that set off this UNK in him of UNK and UNK verbal attack on an enemy STOP 
START all western europe would hear and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century STOP 
START but these UNK that we have surviving from the christ's college days are only one phase of his existence then STOP 
START perhaps his most important private activity was the combination of reading discussion with a few if we can trust his writings to UNK and the younger UNK very few UNK UNK STOP 
START lines UNK of UNK later point to a friendship with edward king who entered christ's college 9 june UNK STOP 
START no other names among the young men in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by milton as those of persons with whom he in any way UNK STOP 
START but that scarcely means that he was the UNK UNK type of student who shared few if any activities with his fellows the UNK of the surviving UNK providing enough evidence to deny this STOP 
START apparently he was not a UNK in the college or university UNK which he once attacked as utterly UNK performances see UNK UNK even in that famous passage milton was UNK not at the UNK as such but at their performance by persons either UNK or presently to enter into the ministry STOP 
START the fact that he nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of the boys later in his UNK academy UNK should not be taken too seriously as evidence that he desired them to UNK such performances STOP 
START perhaps in that short piece or letter written to UNK in which he UNK his scheme for UNK young men he merely UNK that phase of their exercises STOP

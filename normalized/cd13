START if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors UNK the future of our civilization science and religion STOP 
START science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom STOP 
START religion or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether we UNK this power to leave a world utterly destroyed STOP 
START how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge may feel UNK at the outlook STOP 
START and yet there is a note of hope because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision STOP 
START we are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material a universe that in a word is not matter but music STOP 
START and it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an UNK and an UNK of our faith STOP 
START atomic energy to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom STOP 
START you know that i could hold right here in my hand the little UNK of UNK metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on hiroshima STOP 
START it was only about the size of a baseball packed in that UNK ball there was the explosive force of UNK tons of aj STOP 
START that is enough UNK to fill the tower of the empire state building with the availability of bombs of that size war became a new problem STOP 
START now we might have restricted the use of UNK bombs by controlling the sources of UNK because it is found in only a few places in the world STOP 
START but we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new UNK weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb STOP 
START hydrogen is just as UNK as UNK is UNK STOP 
START we know that we have hydrogen in water is af and the h stands for hydrogen is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies STOP 
START i have calculated that if i could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body i would UNK with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on hiroshima STOP 
START i won't try the experiment but i think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go there would be quite an explosion STOP 
START and then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond STOP 
START salt water is still af the same hydrogen is there STOP 
START and the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today STOP 
START of course there is also an optimistic side to the picture STOP 
START for if i knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity i could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body i could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire united states for some days STOP 
START and think if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power what a wonderful public utility company we would make STOP 
START with just the hydrogen of our bodies we could run the world for years STOP 
START then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come STOP 
START it is power with which we can literally UNK the world provide adequate housing food education UNK living for everyone everywhere STOP 
START an UNK atoms now let us see where this power comes from STOP 
START to grasp our new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is STOP 
START i have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry STOP 
START one night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms i asked myself a question suppose i had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body how large an area would they cover calculated first that there are about an UNK atoms in the average human body is a figure one with 27 UNK quite a large number STOP 
START then i calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic UNK peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people a UNK peas would fill all the buildings in the city of philadelphia STOP 
START i saw that i would soon run out of buildings at this rate so i decided to take another measure the whole state of pennsylvania STOP 
START imagine that there is a UNK over pennsylvania but instead of UNK snow it UNK peas we get the whole state covered with peas about four feet deep STOP 
START you can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas UNK up against the houses and covering the cars thus UNK would contain about a UNK peas STOP 
START but we still have a long way to go STOP 
START next we imagine our UNK UNK over all the land areas of the entire globe north america south america europe asia and africa all covered with peas four feet deep we have UNK peas STOP 
START next we UNK over the UNK and cover the whole earth with peas then we go out among the neighboring stars collect 250 planets each the size of the earth and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep then we have UNK STOP 
START finally we go into the UNK reaches of the UNK way get UNK planets cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have UNK peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body STOP 
START so you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are STOP 
START a UNK and space now although an atom is small we can still in imagination have a look at it STOP 
START let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that i UNK a magic alice in UNK growing pill STOP 
START i start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me STOP 
START i shoot up through the roof into the sky past the clouds through the UNK out beyond the moon out among the planets until i am over a hundred and fifty million miles long STOP 
START then this atom of calcium will UNK to something like a great UNK a hundred yards across a UNK big enough to put a football field inside STOP 
START and if you should step inside of such a UNK atom according to the physics of forty years ago you would see UNK over your head down at the sides and under your feet some twenty luminous balls about the size of UNK STOP 
START these balls are moving in great circles and UNK and are of course the electrons the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone STOP 
START since these electrons are moving like planets you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom STOP 
START so you look down there and you see a tiny UNK point about the size of the head of a pin STOP 
START this is the atomic sun the atomic nucleus STOP 
START even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field this nucleus is still only about the size of a UNK STOP 
START it is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these UNK charged electrons in their UNK also contains nearly all the mass and the atomic energy STOP 
START you may ask what else there is and the answer is nothing nothing but empty space STOP 
START and since you are made of atoms you are nothing much but empty space too STOP 
START if i could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a UNK you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone you would be smaller than the smallest UNK of dust that you could see on this piece of paper STOP 
START someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing STOP 
START at any rate it shows us how UNK we are STOP 
START music of the UNK now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a UNK picture STOP 
START for we believed that the electrons UNK the law of mechanics and UNK therefore the atom was really just a little machine in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts STOP 
START so if you are made of atoms you are just a big machine since the universe is also made of atoms it is just a UNK STOP 
START and this would mean that we live in a UNK universe governed by the laws of cause and effect bound in UNK of UNK that hold the universe on a completely UNK course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom STOP 
START and this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were UNK or UNK STOP 
START then came the scientific revolution in the late UNK STOP 
START a suggestion from louis de UNK a UNK in france showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves STOP 
START and to see the meaning of this new picture imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today STOP 
START now as you step inside instead of seeing particles UNK around like planets you see waves and UNK very much like the UNK that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it STOP 
START these UNK spread out in UNK patterns like the rose windows of a great UNK STOP 
START and as the waves flow back and forth and UNK with the waves from the neighboring atoms you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music STOP 
START it is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony STOP 
START harmony melody UNK UNK structure are there as this music UNK and UNK there is an UNK chorus from all the atoms outside in fact from the atoms of the entire universe STOP 
START and so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music STOP 
START the island of UNK part of the state of massachusetts lies about UNK miles southeast of its mother state STOP 
START some of the island is sand and is not suitable for living STOP 
START the island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors rest is obtained from harbor UNK STOP 
START during about three and a half months of the year in the summer there are three boats that run from the mainland to the island carrying passengers food and cars the rest of the year only one boat is needed which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to UNK in the daytime STOP 
START this is a fine trip too on a good day STOP 
START with UNK UNK on one side and the open sea on the other it makes an excellent trip of about three hours STOP

START a tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide an UNK or a UNK UNK STOP 
START the most UNK of all was launched by the explosion of the island of UNK in UNK raced across the pacific at 300 miles an hour UNK the UNK of UNK and UNK with waves 100 to UNK feet high and UNK the shore as far away as san francisco STOP 
START the ancient UNK recorded several UNK UNK by huge waves STOP 
START whether or not plato's tale of the lost continent of UNK is true UNK UNK that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times STOP 
START indeed a UNK destructive tsunami that arose in the UNK sea in 1945 has even UNK the interest of UNK and UNK in the biblical story of the flood STOP 
START one of the most UNK tsunami on record followed the famous UNK UNK of november 1 UNK waves UNK for a week and were felt as far away as the english coast STOP 
START tsunami are rare however in the atlantic ocean are far more common in the pacific STOP 
START japan has had 15 destructive ones eight of them disastrous since UNK STOP 
START the UNK islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years STOP 
START in UNK an UNK in japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the UNK sea wave UNK more than 1,000 ships and boats in UNK bay STOP 
START a tsunami in the UNK islands in UNK washed away an entire town UNK leaving only two UNK trees standing where the community had been STOP 
START in UNK a japanese tsunami killed UNK people and swept away 10,000 homes STOP 
START the dimensions of these waves UNK all our usual standards of measurement STOP 
START an ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest no longer than UNK feet in the atlantic or 1,000 feet in the pacific STOP 
START but a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as UNK miles from crest to crest STOP 
START while a wind wave never UNK at more than 60 miles per hour the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be UNK in hundreds of miles per hour STOP 
START the greater the depth of the water the greater is the speed of the wave law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to UNK STOP 
START in the deep waters of the pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour STOP 
START tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly UNK STOP 
START their UNK sometimes is as little as two feet from UNK to crest STOP 
START usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their UNK heights STOP 
START on the UNK day in UNK when the great waves approached japan UNK at sea noticed no unusual UNK STOP 
START not until they UNK home at the end of the day through a sea UNK with bodies and the UNK of houses were they aware of what had happened STOP 
START the seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with UNK UNK thousands of them and UNK villages along the shore STOP 
START the giant waves are more dangerous on flat UNK than on steep ones STOP 
START they usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height but when they UNK into a UNK UNK or harbor they may rise to UNK proportions STOP 
START generally the first UNK of a tsunami is a rather sharp UNK not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers STOP 
START this is followed by a tremendous UNK of water away from the shore as the first great UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK are left high and dry and the beaches are covered with UNK fish STOP 
START at UNK large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the UNK beach STOP 
START many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore STOP 
START after an UNK in japan in UNK people on the coast at UNK were so UNK by the extraordinary UNK of the sea that they UNK to higher ground STOP 
START when a second UNK came they UNK back to the beach UNK that they might be buried under UNK STOP 
START just as they reached the shore the first huge wave crashed upon them STOP 
START a tsunami is not a single wave but a series STOP 
START the waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more because of their great length and this has often UNK people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over STOP 
START the waves may keep coming for many hours STOP 
START usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest STOP 
START among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at UNK was francis p. UNK of the UNK institution of UNK one of the world's foremost marine UNK STOP 
START he was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves STOP 
START their UNK and retreat he reported was accompanied by a great UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest STOP 
START on some of the UNK beaches the waves came in gently were UNK on the UNK facing the direction of the UNK from which the waves had come STOP 
START in UNK bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high STOP 
START the highest waves UNK feet occurred at UNK valley STOP 
START scientists and UNK have occasionally seen strange UNK of the phenomenon STOP 
START during a UNK tsunami in japan the sea UNK UNK at night STOP 
START the UNK of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the UNK UNK UNK UNK by the UNK of the sea STOP 
START japanese UNK have sometimes observed that UNK UNK up in their UNK during a tsunami have UNK swollen UNK fish have swallowed vast numbers of UNK UNK raised to the surface by the UNK STOP 
START the waves of a UNK tsunami in UNK bay brought to the surface and UNK to death huge numbers of UNK that normally live at a depth of UNK feet STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK them in by the thousands STOP 
START the UNK system developed since the 1946 disaster in hawaii UNK mainly on a simple and UNK instrument devised by commander c. k. green of the coast and UNK survey staff STOP 
START it consists of a series of UNK and a UNK chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface STOP 
START ordinary water UNK are UNK STOP 
START but when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a corresponding UNK in a column of UNK which UNK an electric circuit STOP 
START this in turn sets off an alarm UNK the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress STOP 
START such equipment has been installed at UNK UNK UNK and dutch harbor STOP 
START the moment the alarm goes off information is immediately UNK to UNK which is the center of the warning system STOP 
START this center also receives prompt reports on UNK from four coast survey stations in the pacific which are equipped with UNK STOP 
START its staff makes a preliminary determination of the UNK of the UNK and UNK tide stations near the UNK for a tsunami STOP 
START by means of UNK showing UNK times and depths in the ocean at various locations it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the pacific STOP 
START the civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger and they issue UNK and take all necessary protective steps STOP 
START all of these activities are UNK to a UNK communication system and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly STOP 
START since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the pacific but only one was of any consequence STOP 
START on november 4 1952 an UNK occurred under the sea off the UNK UNK STOP 
START at UNK that afternoon greenwich time the shock was recorded by the UNK alarm in UNK STOP 
START the warning system immediately went into action STOP 
START within about an hour with the help of reports from UNK stations in alaska UNK and california the UNK UNK was placed at UNK degrees north UNK and UNK degrees east UNK STOP 
START while accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the pacific UNK reported it was covered with nine feet of water the UNK station made its UNK and UNK the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at UNK at UNK greenwich time STOP 
START it turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946 STOP 
START they UNK a cement UNK against a UNK in UNK harbor knocked down telephone lines UNK automobiles UNK UNK killed six cows STOP 
START but not a single human life was lost and property damage in the UNK islands did not exceed UNK STOP 
START there is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage STOP 
START but it is plain that a warning system however efficient is not enough STOP 
START in the vulnerable areas of the pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed UNK or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or UNK strongly against waves STOP 
START the key to the world of UNK is change remains the same STOP 
START life has UNK from simple combinations of UNK in the sea to complex combinations in man STOP 
START the land too is changing and UNK are daily UNK of this STOP 
START UNK result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break STOP 
START sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface the shifts cannot be seen but they are there everywhere can be found UNK of earlier breaks once deeply buried STOP 
START today's UNK are most numerous in UNK where the earth's UNK is presently concentrated but UNK of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them STOP 
START the effects of UNK on civilization have been widely UNK even UNK STOP 
START the role of an UNK in starting the destruction of whole cities is UNK frightening but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster STOP 
START UNK has often UNK with fact to color reports STOP 
START we have learned from UNK much of what we now know about the earth's interior for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled STOP 
START these waves have shown that UNK miles below the surface a liquid core begins and that it in turn has a solid inner core STOP 
START UNK UNK as far as 400 miles below the surface but they do not occur at greater depths STOP 
START two UNK UNK are based on these facts STOP 
START 1 as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by UNK flow rather than by breaking as rigid surface rocks do STOP 
START 2 if UNK do occur at such depths why not deeper gained from studying UNK waves has been applied in various fields STOP 
START in the search for oil and gas we make similar waves under controlled conditions with UNK and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources STOP 
START we have also developed techniques for UNK and UNK underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they UNK STOP 
START the following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book causes of catastrophe by l. don UNK STOP 
START the restless earth and its interior at twelve minutes after five on the morning of wednesday april 18 UNK san francisco was shaken by a severe UNK STOP 
START a sharp UNK was followed by a UNK roll STOP

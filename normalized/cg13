START even UNK for all his efforts to UNK a UNK morality in the sun also rises and a farewell to arms never maintained that sex was all STOP 
START UNK fiction is supported by a moral UNK and in its search for ultimate meaning UNK at a religious dimension STOP 
START and d. h. lawrence in UNK of the unconscious protested UNK against the UNK of the sexual motive STOP 
START though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that UNK emphasized this aspect of human nature it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex STOP 
START all is not sex declared lawrence STOP 
START man is not confined to one UNK for his vital energy STOP 
START the creative urge for example UNK the body and the self STOP 
START but for the beat generation all is sex STOP 
START nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex STOP 
START for the UNK like the UNK is in opposition to a society that is based on the UNK of the sex instinct STOP 
START he has elevated sex not UNK or UNK but pure spontaneous UNK sex to the rank of the UNK is UNK UNK venus UNK UNK christ the mysterious and divine UNK energy flowing through the body of the universe STOP 
START jazz is sex UNK is a stimulus to sex the beat UNK is adjusted to the UNK release of the sexual impulse STOP 
START lawrence UNK in the holy UNK stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure is a UNK and their private language is rich in the UNK UNK of sexual reference so that they UNK in a UNK universe of UNK STOP 
START the singular UNK force of their UNK against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place STOP 
START the dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of UNK sexual desire STOP 
START for this reason too their language is more UNK and UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK a sexual experience in which their whole being UNK STOP 
START it is therefore not surprising that they resist the UNK of marriage and the trap of UNK for like cats they are determined not to UNK their sexual energy STOP 
START they UNK to the underground of the UNK where they can UNK the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START unlike the heroes and UNK of the lost generation they UNK the art of UNK and UNK STOP 
START that is reserved for the squares STOP 
START if they avoid the use of the UNK UNK UNK word it is because it is UNK is sacred STOP 
START as UNK the UNK of the beat generation declares in the sexual act the beat are filled with UNK the divine power STOP 
START this is far from the UNK UNK UNK of the middle-class square in heat STOP 
START this is the holy UNK these UNK of the UNK pursue this is the UNK cosmic urge to which they respond STOP 
START if UNK UNK is the UNK who has led them out of the egypt of sexual slavery dylan thomas is the poet who offers them the UNK UNK of justification for their UNK in liquor UNK sex and jazz STOP 
START in addition they have been converted to zen UNK with its UNK of all that is natural and UNK alive the sense that everything in the world is flowing STOP 
START thus paradoxically the beat writers resort to religious UNK they are in search of UNK the spiritual the UNK but not anything connected with formal religion STOP 
START what they are after is the UNK vision STOP 
START and zen UNK though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal UNK are UNK helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release STOP 
START the style of life chosen by the beat generation the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as UNK their own is designed to UNK the value of the sexual experience STOP 
START jazz is good not only because it UNK UNK but because of its decided sexual effect STOP 
START jazz is the musical language of sex the vocabulary of the UNK it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz by UNK the UNK of his UNK can have therapeutic value STOP 
START that is why the argument runs the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet UNK UNK by it STOP 
START instead of giving themselves UNK to the UNK release that jazz can give them they UNK UNK or UNK with UNK or turn to UNK for satisfaction STOP 
START thus jazz is UNK into something holy the sacred road to integration of being STOP 
START jazz like sex is a UNK STOP 
START it is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in UNK man STOP 
START the UNK of sex combined with UNK and jazz is intended to provide a design for living STOP 
START those who are UNK UNK can become UNK alive and free their UNK put at the service of the imagination STOP 
START UNK in their UNK of all that makes for death the beat UNK bid all men become cool cats them learn to swing freely to let go to become UNK themselves and then perhaps civilization will be saved STOP 
START the UNK UNK from a society that is UNK UNK with a UNK drive is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present STOP 
START if he is the child of UNK if he is the UNK victim of an age of atomic wars then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil STOP 
START he will not curb his UNK desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive even if it is only for this brief moment before the UNK of UNK UNK on earth STOP 
START that is why the members of the beat generation UNK assume the title of the holy UNK will destroy the UNK UNK UNK and churches of the state that is the UNK enemy of the life they believe in STOP 
START apart from the UNK UNK they derive from the metaphysics of the UNK the only UNK they are capable of making is that art is their only UNK STOP 
START their writing born of their experiments in UNK and UNK UNK reflects the UNK of their UNK alienation STOP 
START the mind has UNK them reason is the UNK of life will trust only their physical UNK the wisdom of the body the holy UNK of the unconscious STOP 
START with UNK intensity they reveal what they hate but their faith in love inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz UNK in the climax of the UNK STOP 
START their work UNK the UNK of the UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START their rebellion against UNK society is not far removed from the violence of UNK characteristic of the juvenile UNK STOP 
START and the life they lead is UNK and for the most part UNK even though they make a UNK of UNK themselves to some creative pursuit writing painting music STOP 
START they are UNK on principle STOP 
START when they express themselves it is UNK hatred that UNK forth the rage of UNK the UNK of UNK STOP 
START it is sex that UNK them sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic UNK STOP 
START what they discuss with UNK UNK is the degree to which sex can UNK the UNK STOP 
START UNK is the vice from which the UNK fearful middle class continue to suffer whereas the UNK has the courage to break out of that prison of UNK STOP 
START one girl describes her past her succession of broken marriages the UNK she has had and finally UNK that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion STOP 
START if it is an honest feeling then why should she not yield to it most often she says it's the UNK relationship that is UNK STOP 
START there is nothing holy in UNK STOP 
START this girl soon drops the UNK UNK who UNK of her life STOP 
START she finds married life UNK and every prolonged sex relationship UNK UNK STOP 
START this confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution the UNK for sensation for its own sake the need for change for new experiences STOP 
START boredom is death STOP 
START in the realm of physical UNK sex UNK supreme STOP 
START hence the UNK sustain themselves on UNK jazz free swinging poetry UNK themselves in UNK of sex of them are driven over the UNK of UNK and lose contact with reality STOP 
START one beat poet UNK a poem lines on a UNK john which contains a few happy UNK for survival STOP 
START the new fact the UNK of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity STOP 
START the UNK mission of this UNK generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction but what they produce is unfortunately UNK UNK solely on the UNK of UNK STOP 
START who are the creative representatives of this movement UNK UNK drug UNK UNK UNK the weak the UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK and UNK of society STOP 
START they embrace independent poverty usually with a UNK partner who will help support them STOP 
START they are full of contempt for the institution of UNK STOP 
START their previous UNK marriages do not count for they hold the laws of the state null and UNK STOP 
START they feel they are UNK against a hostile UNK world faced with the UNK UNK opposition of squares and their UNK the police STOP 
START this is the UNK of UNK the UNK use in defending their way of life their search for UNK though their actual existence fails to reach these religious heights STOP 
START one UNK got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and UNK and UNK sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up STOP 
START what UNK had she picked up during these long nights of talk as the creative principle of the universe the secret of primitive religion the life of myth STOP 
START everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual UNK STOP 
START in his chapter on the UNK of the beat generation UNK UNK the reader none of the UNK details STOP 
START no one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in west UNK so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group STOP 
START the women who come to west UNK having UNK UNK are interested in living only for the moment in being constantly on the move STOP 
START others who are attracted to this UNK of the beat generation are UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START those who are sexual UNK are naturally drawn to join the UNK STOP 
START since the UNK widely use UNK they do not have to be initiated STOP 
START part of the ritual of sex is the use of UNK STOP 
START as UNK puts it the UNK is felt in the magic circle of UNK with far greater force as a UNK principle in human relationships than at any other time except perhaps in the mutual metaphysical UNK STOP 
START the magic circle is in fact a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical UNK STOP 
START under the influence of UNK the UNK comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully UNK sense of self as if he had discovered the open UNK to the universe of being STOP 
START carried high on this charge he UNK magical poetry that UNK the organic rhythms of life in words STOP 
START if he thus UNK a UNK UNK UNK intensity he pays the price for his UNK by producing work allen UNK UNK is a striking example of this tendency that is UNK UNK but without depth and without UNK control STOP 
START for drugs are in themselves no royal road to UNK STOP 
START how is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic UNK of senses STOP 
START if love reflects the nature of man as UNK UNK UNK believes if the person in love UNK UNK what he is by his behavior in love then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary UNK STOP

START biological warfare biological warfare is the UNK use of living microorganisms or their UNK products for the purpose of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness of man STOP 
START it is the UNK of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific research and development resulting in the production of UNK weapons systems STOP 
START man may also be injured UNK by damage to his food crops or domestic animals STOP 
START biological warfare is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon STOP 
START the major reason for this is that it has no UNK effect STOP 
START the UNK period of infectious disease plus a variable period of illness even before a UNK effect render this weapon UNK for UNK encounter STOP 
START a man can be an effective fighting machine throughout the UNK period of most infectious diseases STOP 
START thus an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population centers such as large cities STOP 
START an important operational procedure in UNK for an enemy would be to create an UNK or cloud of agent over the target area STOP 
START this concept has UNK much basic research concerning the behavior of UNK biological materials the UNK of respiratory UNK the medical management of such diseases and defense against their occurrence STOP 
START the biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied UNK during the past fifteen years STOP 
START much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the UNK exposure of experimental animals to UNK of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics STOP 
START much information has been gathered relative to UNK sampling and UNK techniques STOP 
START much of the older experimental work on respiratory UNK was accomplished by very artificial procedures STOP 
START the UNK UNK of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an UNK animal is far different from exposure through natural UNK to UNK UNK STOP 
START the importance of particle size in such UNK has been thoroughly demonstrated STOP 
START the natural UNK and physiological defensive features of the upper respiratory tract such as the UNK of the nose and the UNK of the UNK and larger UNK are capable of UNK out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence STOP 
START very small particles however in a size range of 1 to 4 UNK in diameter are capable of passing these UNK barriers and entering the UNK bed of the lungs STOP 
START this area is highly UNK to UNK STOP 
START the entrance and retention of infectious particles in the UNK amounts almost to an UNK UNK STOP 
START the relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated in table 1 STOP 
START in considering UNK defense it must be recognized that a number of critical UNK UNK must be met for an UNK to exhibit optimum effect STOP 
START for example bright sunlight is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air STOP 
START there are optimal UNK requirements for various agents when UNK STOP 
START neutral or UNK UNK conditions are necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface STOP 
START it will rise during UNK conditions STOP 
START there are of course certain times during the UNK daily cycle when most of these conditions will be met STOP 
START certain other properties of small particles in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract are UNK in defense considerations STOP 
START the smaller the particle the further it will travel UNK before settling out STOP 
START an UNK of such small particles moreover UNK through structures in much the same manner as a gas STOP 
START there may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion through buildings such as widespread UNK of UNK restaurants food stores hospitals etc. STOP 
START depending on the UNK there may be UNK in some food or UNK products i.e. in milk for example STOP 
START the secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense STOP 
START something of the behavior of clouds of small particles can be illustrated by the following field trials in the first trial an UNK substance was UNK from a boat UNK some ten miles off shore under UNK selected UNK conditions STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK in particles of 2 UNK in size were UNK STOP 
START this material UNK under ultraviolet light which UNK its sampling and assessment STOP 
START four hundred and fifty pounds was UNK while the ship was traveling a distance of UNK miles STOP 
START figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial STOP 
START the particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some UNK miles STOP 
START from these UNK UNK it can be seen that an area of over UNK square miles was covered STOP 
START these UNK could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case STOP 
START the behavior of a biological UNK on a much smaller scale is illustrated by a specific field trial conducted with a UNK UNK STOP 
START an aqueous suspension of the UNK of b. UNK UNK UNK generally known as UNK UNK was UNK using commercially available UNK STOP 
START a satisfactory cloud was produced even though these UNK were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 UNK STOP 
START in this test UNK UNK of a suspension having a count of af UNK per ml or a total of approximately af UNK was UNK STOP 
START the UNK operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small naval vessel UNK two miles UNK and vertical to an UNK breeze STOP 
START UNK continued along a UNK course STOP 
START this operation was started at UNK p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes STOP 
START there was a slight UNK condition a moderate fog and 100 per cent relative UNK STOP 
START a network of sampling stations had been set up on shore STOP 
START these were located at the homes of government employees in government offices buildings and UNK within the trial area STOP 
START a rough attempt was made to UNK the vertical profile of the cloud by taking samples from outside the windows on the first ninth and UNK floors of a government office building STOP 
START all UNK were operated for a period of two hours except one which was operated for four hours STOP 
START in this instance there was a UNK of UNK during the first two hours and a total UNK of UNK for the UNK period a UNK increase STOP 
START this suggests that the sampling period particularly at the more distant locations should have been increased STOP 
START as can be seen from figure 2 an extensive area was covered by this UNK STOP 
START the maximum distance UNK was 23 miles from the source STOP 
START as can be seen from these UNK UNK approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area UNK STOP 
START it is quite likely that an even greater area was covered particularly UNK STOP 
START the UNK in the three levels of the vertical profile were af STOP 
START this was not of course enough sampling to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the UNK STOP 
START a number of unique medical problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural UNK of entry STOP 
START some agents have been shown to be much more UNK or infectious to experimental animals when exposed to UNK of optimum particle size than by the natural UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK for example is several UNK more UNK by this route than when given per UNK STOP 
START in some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure making diagnosis difficult STOP 
START in UNK produced by UNK exposure one would not expect to find the classical UNK of rabbit fever on a finger STOP 
START an enemy would obviously choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious STOP 
START agents that are known to cause frequent UNK among laboratory workers such as those causing q fever UNK UNK UNK UNK etc. belong in this category STOP 
START an agent would likely be selected which would possess sufficient UNK and UNK stability to meet realistic minimal UNK requirements STOP 
START it is obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property STOP 
START in this connection it should be capable of being UNK without excessive destruction STOP 
START moreover it should not be so UNK in its growth requirements as to make production on a UNK significant scale UNK STOP 
START an UNK would use an agent against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or UNK induced UNK in a target population STOP 
START a solid UNK is the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be UNK STOP 
START it must be remembered however that there are many agents for which there is no solid UNK and a partial or UNK UNK may be broken by an appropriate dose of agent STOP 
START there is a broad spectrum of UNK from which selection for a specified military purpose might be made STOP 
START an enemy might choose an UNK UNK UNK a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of UNK STOP 
START it is possible that certain UNK forms may be produced such as UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK may also be developed with changes in UNK properties that are of importance in identification STOP 
START all of these considerations are of critical importance in considering defense and medical management STOP 
START biological agents are of course highly UNK STOP 
START they do not destroy physical structures as is true of high UNK STOP 
START this may be of UNK importance in considering military objectives STOP 
START the question of epidemic disease merits some discussion STOP 
START only a limited effort has been devoted to this problem STOP 
START some of those who question the value of UNK have assumed that the only potential would be in the establishment of UNK STOP 
START they then point out that with our present lack of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall of UNK it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated STOP 
START they argue further and somewhat UNK that our knowledge and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an UNK of disease STOP 
START this is why this approach to UNK defense has not been given major attention STOP 
START our major problem is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target STOP 
START this of course does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease STOP 
START a UNK example will illustrate this point STOP 
START let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an UNK of the UNK agent of epidemic UNK UNK UNK over city a and that a large number of cases of UNK fever resulted UNK STOP 
START no epidemic was initiated nor was one expected because the population in city a was not lousy STOP 
START UNK is a UNK for epidemic UNK STOP 
START in this case then the military objective was accomplished with an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial attack STOP 
START this was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic STOP 
START on the other hand a similar attack might have been made on city b whose population was known to be lousy STOP 
START one might expect some spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness of the attack STOP 
START the major defensive problems are concerned with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from appropriate UNK devices STOP 
START it should be no more difficult to deliver such devices than other weapons STOP 
START the same delivery vehicles whether they be UNK submarines or guided missiles should be UNK STOP 
START if it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city STOP 
START biological agents are moreover suitable for delivery through enemy UNK which UNK many problems in defense STOP 
START a few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned STOP 
START the air conditioning and UNK systems of large buildings are subject to attack STOP 
START america is rapidly becoming a nation that uses processed UNK and even UNK foods STOP 
START this is an enormous industry that is subject to UNK STOP 
START one must include the preparation of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products STOP 
START huge industries are involved also in the production of biological products drugs and UNK which are UNK to this type of attack STOP

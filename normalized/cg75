START there had been signs and UNK like the regular UNK over and UNK of the UNK of UNK di UNK near the UNK UNK and in the UNK STOP 
START something was happening all right slowly it is true but you could feel it STOP 
START the UNK felt it STOP 
START little things STOP 
START an italian poet had noticed UNK policemen UNK around the area of UNK palace the first time since the war STOP 
START at least they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated flat UNK UNK of UNK home district UNK per UNK STOP 
START but who knew that might be coming one of these days STOP 
START there were other UNK who still bore UNK they had earned in police station UNK UNK STOP 
START they laughed and true to national form and manners never talked long or UNK on any subject at all but some of them worried out loud about short memories and UNK STOP 
START we saw UNK UNK at a party once in a while tall lean nervous and handsome and in our opinion the best novelist of them all except UNK and UNK is dead STOP 
START UNK the sky is red had been a small UNK and in its special way the best book to come out of the war STOP 
START now he was married to a beautiful girl had a small son and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies STOP 
START on his desk was a slowly UNK treatment and script of the count of UNK UNK STOP 
START on his UNK were some of the latest american novels including UNK UNK the day but he hadn't read them they were sent by american publishers and wasn't especially interested in what the american writers were up to STOP 
START he was interested in robert UNK the man without qualities STOP 
START so were a lot of other people STOP 
START he was interested in UNK UNK STOP 
START he was thinking his way into a new novel a big one one that people had been waiting for STOP 
START it was going to be hard going all the way because he hadn't written seriously for a while except for a few stories was tired of the old method of UNK he had so successfully used in the sky is red STOP 
START this one was going to be different STOP 
START he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of UNK that he knew so well STOP 
START he was going to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all leave rome and its intellectual UNK and UNK life go back to UNK STOP 
START UNK seemed worried too STOP 
START he knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt a wonderful book not for some strange reason published in the u.s. STOP 
START he knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and UNK to a poor southern UNK boy STOP 
START he knew all about the UNK and the fever and too the moment of realization when he saw for himself threw up his hands and quit ended the war as a UNK in texas STOP 
START UNK knew all about UNK STOP 
START so did his friend the young novelist UNK STOP 
START UNK is tough and UNK and UNK says what he thinks STOP 
START he had put it down in a war novel the day of the lion STOP 
START these people were not talking much about it but you a UNK sensed their apprehension and disappointment STOP 
START so there we were talking around and about it STOP 
START the english lady said she had to go to vienna for a while STOP 
START it was a pity because she had planned to lay a UNK at the foot of the garibaldi statue towering over rome in spectacular UNK from the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START around that statue in the green park where children play and UNK walk in UNK and there is a UNK view of the whole city in that park are the rows of marble UNK of UNK fallen men the ones who one day rushed out of the UNK san UNK and under fire all the way up the long straight narrow lane to take then lose the high ground of the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START when they lost it the french artillery moved in and that was the end for garibaldi that time on 30 april UNK STOP 
START once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow lane STOP 
START we had walked it many times and UNK UNK what a fish barrel it had been for the french STOP 
START now the park is filled with marble UNK and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and proper names of the men who fell STOP 
START we were at a party once and heard an UNK young european call that awful charge glorious STOP 
START our companion was a huge UNK american UNK who had been a UNK UNK all across france in 1944 STOP 
START he said it was stupid UNK to order men to make a charge like that no matter who gave the order and what for STOP 
START oh it would be UNK all right the european said STOP 
START we would see it that way but it was glorious then STOP 
START it was the last time in history anybody could do something UNK like that STOP 
START i thought who is older now world and new world STOP 
START the UNK looked at him UNK and amazed angry STOP 
START he had made an assault once with UNK men STOP 
START it was a picked assault company STOP 
START they went up against an UNK unit of comparable size over a little rise of ground over an open field STOP 
START object a village crossroads STOP 
START they made it killed every last one of the UNK took the village on schedule STOP 
START when it was over eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded STOP 
START the whole thing from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then jumped off took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes STOP 
START the UNK looked at him let the color drain out of his face grinned and looked down into his drink a bad UNK made with raw italian gin STOP 
START UNK he said softly STOP 
START excuse me the european said STOP 
START i am not familiar with the expression STOP 
START the apartment where we were talking that afternoon in march faced onto the street UNK men had charged up and along STOP 
START across the way from the apartment building is a ruined house shot to hell that day in UNK and left that way as a memorial STOP 
START there is a bronze UNK on the wall STOP 
START like everything else in rome UNK and UNK alike that house is lived in STOP 
START i have seen UNK UNK across the ruined roof STOP 
START the english lady really wanted to put a UNK on the garibaldi monument on the UNK of april STOP 
START she had her reasons for this STOP 
START for one thing there wasn't going to be any ceremony at all this year STOP 
START there were a few reasons for that too garibaldi had been taken up and UNK by the communists nowadays STOP 
START therefore the government wanted no part of him STOP 
START it is sort of as if our government should decide to UNK washington or lincoln for the same reason STOP 
START and then there were UNK matters the matter of UNK UNK STOP 
START there was a new pope and the UNK was making itself heard and felt these days STOP 
START as it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself but of more liberal political UNK STOP 
START nothing was going to be done this year to UNK UNK bold and UNK defense of rome STOP 
START all that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a UNK at its base STOP 
START this would show that somebody even a UNK living in rome cared STOP 
START and then there were other things STOP 
START some of the marble UNK in the park are of young UNK who fought and died for garibaldi STOP 
START she also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers at the UNK of UNK di UNK STOP 
START it is hard for me to know how i feel about UNK di UNK STOP 
START i suffer from mixed feelings STOP 
START he was a UNK handsome and sensitive young poet STOP 
START his UNK shows an intense UNK UNK face STOP 
START he flew over rome one day during the early days of UNK and scattered UNK over the city UNK the UNK STOP 
START he was never heard of again STOP 
START he is thought either to have been killed by the UNK as soon as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and UNK his plane STOP 
START he was thus an early and spectacular victim STOP 
START and there is something so wonderfully romantic about it all STOP 
START he really didn't know how to fly STOP 
START he had crashed on UNK once before STOP 
START gossip had it for gossip is the soul of rome that a famous american dancer of the time had paid for both the planes STOP 
START it was absurd and dramatic STOP 
START it is remembered and has been UNK by a UNK in a park and a square in the city which was UNK UNK UNK di UNK after the war STOP 
START most UNK even some UNK know it by the old name STOP 
START faced with a gesture like di UNK i find usually that my UNK are closer to those of my UNK friend STOP 
START the things that happened in police station UNK were dirty UNK and most often anonymous STOP 
START no poetry no UNK no dancers STOP 
START that is how the real routine of resistance goes on and its strength is directly UNK to the number of UNK people who can let themselves be taken to pieces piece by piece without UNK STOP 
START it is an ugly business and there are few if any UNK for them STOP 
START i keep thinking of a young woman i knew during the occupation in UNK STOP 
START she was from UNK STOP 
START she had been picked up by the russians questioned in connection with some UNK UNK to life UNK for UNK STOP 
START she escaped crawled through the usual mine fields under barbed wire was shot at UNK a river and we finally picked her up in UNK STOP 
START she showed us what had happened to her STOP 
START no UNK no UNK UNK statements STOP 
START just no spot not even a UNK spot on her whole body that wasn't UNK UNK on top of UNK from UNK STOP 
START i understand very well about UNK di UNK and how his action is symbolic STOP 
START the trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem a very realistic one STOP 
START the english lady wanted to pay tribute to garibaldi and to UNK di UNK but she wasn't going to be here to do it STOP 
START were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for her by UNK so to speak was a pretty thorough silence at that point STOP 
START my UNK stirring coffee UNK against the side of the cup sounded as loud as a bell STOP 
START i thought what the hell not said i would do it for her STOP 
START i had some reasons too STOP 
START i UNK the english lady STOP 
START i hate embarrassing UNK and have been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one STOP 
START i also had and have feelings about garibaldi STOP 
START like every UNK i can't escape the romantic tradition of brave UNK UNK lost causes STOP 
START though UNK fight was small UNK compared to UNK charge which like all southerners i view in almost UNK terms fallen angels etc. i associated the two STOP 
START and to top it all i am often sentimental on purpose trying to prove to myself that i am not afraid of sentiment STOP 
START so much for all that STOP 
START the english lady was pleased and enthusiastic STOP 
START she gave me the names of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even march up to the monument with me STOP 
START the idea of the march pleased her STOP 
START maybe twenty thirty fifty STOP 
START maybe i could call UNK at the magazine UNK where he worked STOP

START individuals UNK unusual gifts and great personal power were UNK at death into UNK spirits were almost immediately UNK for these newer even more terrible abilities STOP 
START their direct UNK inherited not only their UNK UNK but also the UNK of their UNK power as spirits in the other half of the universe STOP 
START royal UNK could be based on extraordinary UNK achievements translated into eternal UNK power STOP 
START thus the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less UNK UNK STOP 
START but this UNK was not without its UNK responsibilities STOP 
START since he possessed more power in an UNK universe of living beings and dead spirits the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living STOP 
START the royal ritual generated power into the other world it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world STOP 
START proper ritual UNK at any level of society was capable of UNK power for use in the spirit world naturally the royal ritual which provided unusual control over already UNK powerful divine spirits was held responsible for UNK the universe and UNK the welfare of the kingdom STOP 
START this is the familiar system of cosmic government STOP 
START the chinese emperor by proper UNK of ritual UNK divine powers STOP 
START he UNK the UNK of light and darkness yang and UNK which are locked in eternal struggle STOP 
START by UNK the balance between them he effected the UNK of the seasons STOP 
START his power was so great that he even promoted and UNK gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to UNK STOP 
START in this system no man is UNK from obligations STOP 
START failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family UNK to community UNK any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were UNK against the dead STOP 
START and to UNK the dead meant to UNK their UNK and thus UNK the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START the family home was in fact a temple the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature STOP 
START the dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear STOP 
START the common belief was that there existed one moral order which included everything STOP 
START the dead controlled the material prosperity of the living and the living UNK to strict codes of conduct in order not to UNK that control STOP 
START men believed they could control nature by UNK a moral code STOP 
START if the moral code were UNK the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous result could be UNK UNK or UNK STOP 
START modern UNK have difficulty UNK this fusion of moral and material largely because in the west the historical trend has been to deny the connection STOP 
START living in urban conditions away from the UNK of village UNK and the UNK of a UNK world view the individual may find it possible say to commit UNK not only without personal UNK but also without suffering any adverse effects in his UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a UNK and UNK that no powerful UNK UNK could ever UNK plus the added UNK from the UNK of silent burial UNK STOP 
START in china the magical system par excellence was UNK STOP 
START the UNK were UNK UNK who saw an UNK unity the UNK underlying all phenomena STOP 
START it was this UNK unity that was UNK and not its temporary UNK in the world of reality STOP 
START the UNK believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical UNK other words they were actually an organization of UNK STOP 
START mahayana UNK was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts STOP 
START after this form of indian UNK had been introduced into china it UNK extensive changes STOP 
START during its UNK in the sixth to the eighth centuries mahayana offered a supernatural package to the chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly UNK philosophical zen UNK offered to the modern western reader STOP 
START mahayana had gods and magic a UNK UNK and UNK and UNK UNK priests UNK and UNK all of whom UNK power over souls in the other world STOP 
START the UNK mahayana saint possessed UNK powers and magic STOP 
START the mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of UNK and UNK magic that made the world into a huge magical garden STOP 
START in its UNK form mahayana was merely an organization of UNK UNK UNK who UNK to the chinese faith in the supernatural STOP 
START UNK UNK was a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the UNK of a cosmic government STOP 
START UNK had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power STOP 
START if a man lived a classical life he need not fear the spirits for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him STOP 
START but let us not be mistaken about UNK virtue was not virtue as we understand the word today and it did not mean an UNK of the belief in magic UNK STOP 
START to the UNK virtue simply meant UNK and correct UNK of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones STOP 
START UNK was UNK with ritual UNK the mark of a true gentleman STOP 
START to live correctly in an UNK moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate STOP 
START this in brief was the historical background out of which zen emerged STOP 
START UNK of zen to the west record its UNK and recognize that zen grew out of a combination of UNK and indian mahayana UNK STOP 
START but the marvelous person that is supposed to result from zen exhibits more chinese UNK than indian UNK he UNK magical powers and can use them to order nature and to UNK souls STOP 
START UNK of zen to the west emphasize UNK the amount of mahayana UNK in zen probably in order to UNK the UNK magical UNK ideas with more respectable UNK UNK STOP 
START but in the chinese mind there was little difference between the two the UNK were no more metaphysical than a UNK has to be STOP 
START actually zen UNK more to chinese UNK than it does to mahayana UNK STOP 
START the UNK zen UNK may have derived its UNK from mahayana but its psychology was pure early UNK STOP 
START this is well evidenced by the UNK UNK carried over in zen the idea of the UNK turning of thought the UNK to put aside desires and UNK so that a return to purity peace and UNK a union with the infinite with the UNK could be effected STOP 
START in fact the UNK to UNK ceremonies UNK by modern UNK as so UNK characteristic of the direct thinking UNK was a feature of UNK STOP 
START so too was the insistence on the UNK of the external world and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor UNK indeed for immediate perception by pure UNK spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to UNK consciousness STOP 
START zen maintains that UNK things are only the surface of experience STOP 
START one of its features attractive to the west is its UNK for tradition and UNK and for sacred UNK STOP 
START one UNK is supposed to have UNK sacred scriptures for use in an UNK STOP 
START but this is not the spirit of UNK freedom of action for which the UNK mistakes it STOP 
START it is simply that in UNK tradition as in all good UNK books words or any other UNK that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience STOP 
START the truth the eternal truth is not UNK by words STOP 
START reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge but a positive UNK STOP 
START the technique of reality confusion the use of UNK and UNK to shake the UNK grip on reality originated with fourth and third century b.c. chinese UNK the UNK is not basically a new device STOP 
START it is important for an understanding of zen to realize that the UNK UNK of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man STOP 
START in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a UNK ordering of nature popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers STOP 
START and this is only natural witness the UNK with which modern man UNK the latest wonder drug STOP 
START early chinese UNK was UNK aimed at a UNK UNK union with the divine personal salvation being achieved when the UNK UNK united with divine essence STOP 
START but this UNK doctrine was lost in the UNK to acquire special powers STOP 
START the UNK UNK in fact to UNK influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor UNK his power STOP 
START thus the mahayana UNK of UNK union for salvation was UNK down to a bare UNK and for this reason the UNK in asia did not long remain in isolated UNK STOP 
START as the zen literature reveals as soon as an early zen master UNK fame in UNK he was called out into the world to exercise his powers STOP 
START the early UNK masters attracted UNK because of their presumed ability to perform UNK STOP 
START UNK of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine opposed the UNK UNK of china and proposed instead a more mature less UNK view of the universe STOP 
START in support of this stories from the early literature are cited to show that zen attacks the idea of supernatural power STOP 
START but actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess as well as the extreme degree of popular UNK UNK UNK o UNK one day going up mount UNK UNK which was believed to have been UNK by UNK with supernatural powers met with a monk whose eyes UNK strange light STOP 
START they went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river UNK with UNK STOP 
START there being no bridge the master had to stop at the shore his companion crossed the river walking on the water and UNK to UNK UNK to follow him STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK said if i knew thou art an UNK i would have doubled you up before thou got over there monk then understood the spiritual UNK of UNK UNK and praised him as a true UNK STOP 
START 1 a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess on one occasion yang UNK UNK saw a stranger monk flying through the air STOP 
START when that monk came down and approached him with a UNK UNK he asked where art thou from early this morning replied the other i set out from india STOP 
START why said the teacher art thou so late i stopped responded the man several times to look at beautiful UNK STOP 
START thou UNK have supernatural powers exclaimed yang UNK yet thou must give back the spirit of UNK to me STOP 
START then the monk praised yang UNK saying i have come over to china in order to worship UNK and met unexpectedly with minor UNK and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from india went back through the air STOP 
START 2 in the popular chinese mind UNK zen was no exception to the ideas of UNK magic that dominated STOP 
START a closer look at modern zen reveals many magical UNK that are still part of popular zen attitudes STOP 
START to the zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings who have to be UNK STOP 
START part of the UNK ritual in the UNK consists in UNK of rice to the spiritual beings STOP 
START modern zen presentation to the west UNK on the UNK highly UNK nature of the zen belief scriptures are burned to make fire action is based on direct UNK and so on STOP 
START this picture of extreme UNK UNK is difficult to UNK with such UNK formulas as o you UNK and other spiritual beings i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the UNK and other spiritual beings be fed UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP

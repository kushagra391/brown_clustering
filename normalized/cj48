START the summary report on desegregation progress in education in the UNK region 1959 1960 clearly shows two pieces of information STOP 
START the summary report which was prepared for this conference indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing that both actual and pending desegregation is with few exceptions the product or result of court order STOP 
START the report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow STOP 
START the UNK region as defined by the national association of UNK relations officials UNK consists of the states of kentucky maryland tennessee west virginia delaware virginia and the district of columbia STOP 
START the states and the nation's capital all have some desegregation in fact some UNK back to 1954 the region also UNK some of the UNK opposition STOP 
START desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance UNK pupil assignment with no assignments of negro children and hate UNK STOP 
START desegregation and court order now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order STOP 
START first kentucky STOP 
START elementary school desegregation came to owen and union counties which already had high school desegregation STOP 
START the action was a result of a court order the UNK for which and for other court action mentioned in this paper is taken from the summary report for this conference STOP 
START in maryland the UNK county board of education had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but which a UNK had UNK county school board and federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation STOP 
START additional school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel STOP 
START similarly further desegregation may come from suits pending in three tennessee cities UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START in west virginia the number of white and negro children attending the same school has increased almost UNK STOP 
START there are no court decisions here STOP 
START as in maryland a district court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in delaware STOP 
START as a result of the state board of education plan negro children entered UNK white elementary schools in five districts STOP 
START the third circuit court of appeals is UNK an appeal from the plan STOP 
START in virginia court orders led to desegregation in UNK and UNK counties STOP 
START desegregation in UNK county is pending because of court order although date of admission is not yet determined STOP 
START negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in UNK UNK UNK and warren counties STOP 
START desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by negro UNK against school boards in newport news UNK county UNK county and UNK STOP 
START as a school district the district of columbia has had UNK schools since 1954 shortly after the supreme court decision STOP 
START this UNK makes it clear that school desegregation continues including the old UNK state in spite of its stern resistance STOP 
START the record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order on the immediate horizon if further UNK relatively speaking desegregation comes it will result from court orders on suits filed in several UNK states STOP 
START knowledge that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in UNK leads to a conclusion that UNK is slow STOP 
START before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary report as it refers to the district of columbia STOP 
START that reference in the report is continuation of the trend toward an UNK school system a remark apparently UNK by the increase of negro school population from UNK per cent to UNK per cent STOP 
START i see no real prospects for an UNK school population STOP 
START west of rock creek park is still UNK white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of UNK UNK housing program STOP 
START nearby UNK bottom is UNK negroes STOP 
START the large acreage in the southwest UNK area UNK white people what with UNK town houses and elevator apartments STOP 
START the capitol hill rehabilitation like UNK bottom UNK negroes with whites but also UNK some whites with other whites STOP 
START the UNK break with tradition the past and present of white ring around a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery county suburbs to negro residents and presumably the UNK conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the negro by UNK to the suburbs STOP 
START in fact short of UNK to UNK virginia or UNK maryland white people may have to live with negroes STOP 
START all of this must be taken into account before the image of an UNK d.c. public school system is UNK up STOP 
START problems to solve from the summary report before us at this conference a number of problems are apparent STOP 
START they UNK us and UNK us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems STOP 
START first how can we step up the desegregation movement is slow STOP 
START i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together can and do attend STOP 
START i believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color STOP 
START in general members of UNK would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone STOP 
START how to achieve this objective is a problem but we are not divided on what we want STOP 
START second as we increase the number of UNK school districts and schools themselves how can we achieve this action through school board action may be county school board or state school board action as well as that of municipal school boards STOP 
START UNK can we reduce the role of the district courts so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court is a problem and i believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should UNK and effect a plan of desegregation STOP 
START third how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools simply a brief program when the schools are actually UNK but a continuing program that also UNK integration that UNK the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro but as human beings STOP 
START again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education whether it should be done STOP 
START fourth in the segregated school system during the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity fact in the UNK school system which may have a good many schools with UNK population how can we assure equal opportunity is a problem but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence STOP 
START fifth in the segregated school system or in the UNK or UNK schools how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group we help children adjust to images of other children when the latter are not actually present STOP 
START now the issues if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge sharply divide us UNK relations UNK and lay people STOP 
START issue no. 1 STOP 
START UNK assignment STOP 
START UNK on the one hand school desegregation has come in virginia UNK with pupil assignment shall we support the plan the basis of pupil assignment criteria judge albert bryan has assigned negro children to formerly white schools in UNK and UNK virginia STOP 
START shall we support pupil assignment the other hand looking at the larger picture is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or reduced school desegregation to a UNK we therefore oppose the plan question is an issue because it likely UNK us into two camps those for or against pupil assignment STOP 
START issue no. 2 STOP 
START UNK assignment in order to UNK STOP 
START -hlin large cities like baltimore UNK and washington d.c. should school desegregation be extended to UNK and UNK schools by UNK white and negro teachers respectively the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an UNK school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another race STOP 
START we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially UNK situation STOP 
START issue no. 3 STOP 
START -hlthe UNK in school desegregation cases STOP 
START -hlthe earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation STOP 
START in each instance the UNK was a private citizen STOP 
START in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire state of mississippi no UNK has come forth STOP 
START and i have established that the action of municipal county or state school boards or boards of education is small UNK small in comparison with the number of districts STOP 
START is the requirement that the UNK be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement congress UNK the attorney general to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the attorney general to act was eliminated should we nevertheless support such a UNK is an issue for it UNK people rather sharply STOP 
START issue no. 4 STOP 
START UNK of funds to schools that deny children on account of race STOP 
START UNK is the powell amendment which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american veterans committee UNK STOP 
START should we support a UNK in federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny federal funds to a school district that UNK admission to a child on account of his race is UNK than earlier powell UNK which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts STOP 
START there is UNK considerable argument against the UNK UNK though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary to the public schools STOP 
START the federal funds UNK UNK the support of many the opposition of quite a few STOP 
START issue no. 5 STOP 
START UNK public education STOP 
START UNK a political subdivision state or county or UNK be required to furnish public education the school year UNK the prince edward county virginia board of UNK voted not to provide funds for public education and the school board therefore could provide no public education for white or negro children STOP 
START is public education in this american democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education is this subject a matter of UNK a matter of states rights or county rights people don't want to provide public education should they be forced to do so if we marshal substantial agreement behind UNK public education we likely cannot expect that all the states will UNK the legislation STOP 
START should the requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be UNK by the united states congress must it become law by amendment of the united states constitution actually have two issues in this question goal and method STOP 
START issue no. 6 STOP 
START UNK responsibility for education of the citizens STOP 
START -hlif the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens issue no. 6 may be UNK STOP 
START if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being UNK and resolved does the federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in prince edward county half the children still receive no education STOP 
START must or should the federal government help the government directly provide education for the children who want public education STOP

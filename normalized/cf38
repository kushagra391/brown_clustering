START yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms UNK and wagons and UNK UNK kept gathering all morning until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept UNK out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap STOP 
START this was a bitterly fought game carrying almost as much UNK as a fist fight with no UNK UNK between the teams except the formal UNK that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd STOP 
START every pitch in the game brought forth a UNK from the UNK audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped and because their right UNK was still a little UNK from drink they dropped many called forth UNK of UNK STOP 
START at one point in the game when the UNK old man in UNK who was acting as UNK got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the UNK he lay there UNK while players and spectators UNK over whether the ball was dead or the base UNK were free to score STOP 
START this was typical of such games which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship STOP 
START when the visitors after losing this game rode along the village streets toward home the youngsters who could keep UNK of them for a moment or two screamed UNK you bunch of UNK back home UNK was surely the national game in those days even though professional baseball may have been merely a business STOP 
START radio UNK had not begun and most UNK of baseball attended the games near home in the town park or a pasture with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the UNK or the pirates or the indians or the red sox STOP 
START young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places even if they failed to make the major UNK STOP 
START nearly any UNK with a UNK of skill might find a UNK UNK him in the three i league or the UNK league or the UNK plains league or the fast eastern league if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city UNK that UNK everywhere STOP 
START even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams sponsored by UNK and hardware merchants or department stores that played two or three times a week throughout the summer usually in the cool of the evening before an earnest and partisan audience who did not UNK a quarter each or even more to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over STOP 
START UNK ruth of course was UNK hero and everyone knew him even though relatively few ever saw him play ball STOP 
START his face was always in the newspapers sometimes in UNK that seemed nearly as large as life STOP 
START as the UNK grew older and as radio UNK of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the UNK of the UNK the great UNK always led by UNK ruth UNK the game so that UNK were nearly of no account STOP 
START boys no longer bothered learning to UNK and even school kids UNK to UNK up on a bat as willie UNK and the famous UNK of another day had done STOP 
START other UNK UNK with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching ruth who was still called UNK by all his friends or UNK or UNK by those who dared to UNK him UNK was the name of the ball player he liked the least and who called most of the world kid STOP 
START lou UNK was given the UNK UNK and he ran ruth a close race in home runs STOP 
START but the UNK never stuck and UNK was no match for ruth in color which is sometimes a UNK word for UNK behavior on and off the field STOP 
START ruth was a UNK boy still but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally UNK a cracked bone to do it STOP 
START a few professional baseball players UNK UNK with the encouragement of the press so that they might see their names in big black print along with UNK UNK al UNK earl UNK and the prince of UNK STOP 
START one who for a time succeeded best and was still the UNK of all was charles arthur UNK who called himself in the newspapers art the great or the great UNK STOP 
START it was his UNK that he could beat everybody at anything but especially at fighting and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists STOP 
START he was given to public UNK and to acting the UNK on the UNK a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass UNK in UNK pocket once when he had occasion to collar the great first UNK for some forgotten reason STOP 
START this made a UNK named UNK wonder in print if art had worn this UNK when he defeated his manager STOP 
START the sorry fact about this young man who was barely of age when he broke into UNK baseball was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being never so good as he claimed and always an UNK to his associates but a good steady UNK when he could fight down the temptation to UNK on his skills or cut up in public STOP 
START in his minor way charles arthur UNK was perhaps more typical of his era than ruth was for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these scott UNK days for the sake of UNK space in the newspapers STOP 
START there were others who climbed UNK and refused to come down who UNK strange objects like live fish who UNK to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor with or without a partner who UNK to down full bottles of UNK gin without UNK for breath STOP 
START one young man UNK to the point of UNK by liquor and the excitement of the moment performed a perfect UNK dive out of the stands at the yale bowl during the UNK football game landed squarely on his head on the concrete UNK below and died at once STOP 
START but the UNK were not all UNK and a UNK after recognition STOP 
START the business of baseball began to UNK along with other UNK and performers thanks partly to george UNK UNK spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher UNK too STOP 
START while fifty years before albert UNK UNK secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo club and request a UNK of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in august in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate STOP 
START and while less than ten years earlier the UNK black sox all of them top performers in their positions had UNK for UNK charles UNK at UNK ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to UNK hundred dollars a year stars now were asking ten thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars yes even fifty thousand dollars a season STOP 
START the greatest team of this period was unquestionably the new york yankees bought by UNK millions and made into a ball club by men named ed UNK and miller UNK STOP 
START boston fans sometimes liked to UNK some UNK satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great UNK crew were graduates of the red sox sold to UNK UNK and UNK by a man who could not deny them their most UNK desire STOP 
START ruth himself still UNK his farm in massachusetts and an interest in the massachusetts UNK business that printed his round UNK face on the UNK had led the parade down from UNK park followed by UNK carl mays UNK joe bush UNK UNK UNK UNK and sam jones catcher wally UNK third UNK joe UNK who completed the UNK UNK of ruth UNK and UNK and UNK UNK scott STOP 
START by UNK when the mighty UNK were at their UNK only a few of these were left but they still UNK UNK even beside able and UNK UNK like tony UNK who managed never to have one of his UNK fits on the field mark UNK lou UNK george UNK and UNK earl UNK STOP 
START the UNK of this team through two seasons and in the two world's series that followed have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said STOP 
START but there is one small episode that a few new york fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one world's series game in UNK like best to recall STOP 
START UNK ruth as he always did in the stadium played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes and tommy UNK a rather UNK UNK who played UNK for the st. louis UNK knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden UNK where ruth could not reach it STOP 
START the ball lay there shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while ruth UNK with frustration charged about the small patch of ground screaming UNK the UNK ball as he UNK UNK when the inning was over not a UNK in the place would tell me so little tommy ran all the way home STOP 
START the ordinary man and woman however saw little of the great professional games of those golden days or of any other UNK event for that matter STOP 
START UNK always UNK to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy UNK and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance STOP 
START radio UNK however now that even plain people could afford loud speakers on their sets held old fans to the UNK races and attracted new ones chiefly women who through what the philosopher called the UNK UNK of UNK became first UNK then attracted then UNK to the long afternoon UNK of the UNK in some distant baseball park STOP 
START in some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on UNK the UNK was UNK and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were UNK STOP 
START this had a pleasant effect upon the sunday gate UNK as well as upon the UNK of the rail and bus companies some of which began to offer special UNK rates including seats at the park just as the UNK and ferry companies had when baseball was new STOP 
START while women had always attended ball games in small numbers it was the part of a dead game sport in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root root root for the home team they had often sat in patient UNK unable even to read the UNK which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and UNK STOP 
START the questions women asked at baseball games were standard UNK for amateur comedy as were the UNK of women automobile drivers every grown man except a few who were always suspected of being shy on UNK knew at least the UNK of baseball just as every male american in this era liked to imagine or UNK that he could fight with his fists STOP 
START and women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the UNK hit the ball STOP 
START radio however so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have UNK days any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home STOP 
START women actually began to appear UNK in the stands where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a UNK UNK on a clean skirt or a new curse word UNK their ears STOP 
START the radio UNK themselves were often so UNK UNK despite the baseball UNK that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school STOP

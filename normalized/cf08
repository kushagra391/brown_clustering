START in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony STOP 
START the partners each bring to it UNK love and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy STOP 
START at its most UNK moments husband and wife are elevated far above UNK UNK STOP 
START everything else is closed away STOP 
START this is the ideal STOP 
START but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved STOP 
START instead one partner or the other UNK the sexual relationship STOP 
START in the past it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive STOP 
START but today there are signs that these roles are being UNK STOP 
START in a growing number of american homes marriage UNK report the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships STOP 
START it is she who decides the time the place the UNK and the frequency of the sexual act STOP 
START it is she who says UNK or UNK to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics not the husband STOP 
START the whole act is UNK to her pleasure and not to theirs STOP 
START beyond a certain point of course no woman can be dominant nature has seen to that STOP 
START but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the UNK bed STOP 
START of course there remain many UNK marriages in which the husband maintains his UNK STOP 
START yet even in these marriages psychologists say wives are UNK themselves more strongly STOP 
START the UNK most UNK wife of today is a UNK by her mother's or UNK standards STOP 
START to many experts this trend was inevitable STOP 
START they consider it simply a sign of our times STOP 
START our society has UNK the woman giving her new independence and new authority STOP 
START it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role STOP 
START the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum declares dr. mary UNK UNK medical director of the planned UNK federation of america and author of the recent book release from sexual tensions STOP 
START it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself STOP 
START a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more UNK too STOP 
START yet many psychologists and marriage UNK agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be UNK and even dangerous STOP 
START it can in fact UNK a marriage STOP 
START when a husband is UNK UNK and UNK of his wife's desires she is UNK of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her STOP 
START and she begins to regard him as savage UNK and UNK STOP 
START on the other hand UNK UNK UNK the husband UNK his UNK and UNK him of his UNK STOP 
START he is a target of UNK to his wife and often since private affairs rarely remain private to the outside world as well STOP 
START a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's UNK declares dr. UNK STOP 
START this opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading UNK dr. UNK e. UNK director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health STOP 
START when the roles of husband and wife are UNK so that the wife becomes leader and the husband UNK dr. UNK says the effects on their whole relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous STOP 
START in one extreme case cited by a pittsburgh UNK an office UNK wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the UNK she demanded STOP 
START to win her UNK her husband first took an additional job then desperately began to UNK from his employer STOP 
START caught at last he was UNK to prison STOP 
START while he was in UNK his wife UNK him STOP 
START more typical is the case of a suburban long island UNK described by a marriage UNK STOP 
START this woman repeatedly complained she was too tired for UNK relations STOP 
START to please her her husband assumed some of the domestic chores STOP 
START finally he was cooking washing dishes bathing the children and even UNK and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them STOP 
START one wife described by a new york UNK so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule writing it down right between the weekly UNK meetings and the UNK neighborhood card parties STOP 
START another put sex on a UNK basis STOP 
START after every money argument she UNK her husband's UNK until the matter was settled in her favor STOP 
START experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be UNK STOP 
START the wife is likely to be young sophisticated smart as a whip often a girl who has UNK a promising career for marriage STOP 
START she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to UNK her husband STOP 
START the husband is usually a UNK professional preoccupied with his job often an organization man whose UNK for getting ahead is don't rock the boat STOP 
START sometimes this leads to his becoming UNK dominant in marriage STOP 
START UNK in on the job and unable to assert himself he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area STOP 
START more often though he is so accustomed to UNK to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home STOP 
START some psychologists in fact suggest that UNK husbands often are more to blame for UNK marriages than their wives STOP 
START the wife's attempt at control these psychologists UNK is sometimes merely a UNK effort to UNK her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job STOP 
START naturally no woman can ever completely UNK the sexual initiative STOP 
START unless her husband also desires sex the act cannot be UNK STOP 
START generally however in such marriages as those cited the husband is at his wife's mercy STOP 
START the pattern says dr. morton UNK UNK at new UNK lincoln institute for UNK is for the husband to UNK about UNK and eagerly virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night STOP 
START no one seriously UNK of course that the UNK wife is UNK speaking a new character in our world STOP 
START after all the UNK husband with his UNK wife is a UNK figure of long standing in literature and on the stage as dr. UNK points out STOP 
START there is no evidence that these UNK became suddenly UNK when they crossed the UNK of the master bedroom STOP 
START furthermore dr. UNK says a certain number of UNK UNK men always have been around STOP 
START they aren't UNK and they aren't UNK just restrained in all of life STOP 
START they like to be dominated STOP 
START one such man once UNK to dr. UNK UNK new york UNK that he preferred to have his wife the sexual UNK STOP 
START asked why he replied UNK because that's no activity for a gentleman STOP 
START but such cases were in the past unusual STOP 
START society here and abroad has been built around the UNK male even the bible appears to UNK the concept STOP 
START family survival on our own western frontier for example could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the UNK the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything including the marriage bed STOP 
START this carried over into the more UNK late UNK and early 20th centuries when the man ruled the UNK in the best UNK life with father manner STOP 
START in those days a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere STOP 
START grandma wasn't expected to like it dr. UNK UNK the late UNK UNK once UNK up the attitude of the UNK STOP 
START wives of the period UNK thought of themselves as used by their husbands and history indicates they often quite literally were STOP 
START when was the turning point did women begin to assert themselves UNK date it from woman UNK others from when women first began to challenge men in the UNK still others from the era of the UNK UNK and UNK gin STOP 
START virtually everyone agrees however that the trend toward female sexual UNK was UNK accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs STOP 
START left alone while her husband was miles away in the city the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male STOP 
START circumstances gave her almost UNK UNK over UNK UNK and home maintenance STOP 
START she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless STOP 
START she liked this taste of authority and independence and with darkness was not likely to give it up STOP 
START very few wives says dr. UNK who balance the UNK fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with the UNK are suddenly going to become UNK where sex is concerned STOP 
START a woman who UNK other family affairs will UNK the sexual relationship as well STOP 
START and an additional factor was helping to make women more UNK UNK the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response STOP 
START marriage UNK and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax STOP 
START they began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response STOP 
START in fact the noted UNK and sex UNK dr. albert UNK has declared UNK that women are UNK superior to men STOP 
START according to dr. UNK the average UNK american woman is capable of far greater sexual UNK than her partner STOP 
START not surprisingly dr. UNK says some recently UNK wives are out to claim these capabilities STOP 
START yet paradoxically according to dr. UNK UNK many wives UNK their husbands for not standing up to them STOP 
START an aggressive woman wants a man to demand not UNK under STOP 
START when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's UNK dr. UNK says the wife in turn finds him inadequate STOP 
START often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction STOP 
START one such wife dr. UNK says became UNK with her weak husband and UNK through a series of UNK affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man STOP 
START but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover too had been UNK and reduced to UNK STOP 
START then the wife UNK to the next on the list STOP 
START in some cases however domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary UNK by a passing but urgent emotional need STOP 
START thus a man who is UNK a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed the one place he can still be champion STOP 
START if his UNK problems work out he may return to his old pattern STOP 
START sometimes a burst of UNK will sweep over a man or his wife because he or she feels age UNK up STOP 
START on the other hand a husband who always has been vigorous and UNK may suddenly become passive asking psychologists say for UNK that his wife still finds him desirable STOP 
START or a wife may make sudden demands that she be UNK UNK or UNK simply because she needs her ego lifted STOP 
START in any case dr. UNK remarks such problems are a UNK own affair and can't always be measured by a general UNK STOP 
START as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex it makes little difference if one or the other UNK dr. UNK declares STOP 
START the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment STOP 
START other experts say however that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period it is likely to shake the marriage STOP 
START and just as domination today often begins with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband STOP 
START to get a marriage back where it belongs comments dr. UNK of the lincoln institute the husband must take some very basic steps STOP 
START he must begin paradoxically by becoming more UNK STOP 
START he must become more UNK of his own desires more demanding and less understanding STOP 
START too many husbands dr. UNK continues worry about how well they're doing and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play STOP

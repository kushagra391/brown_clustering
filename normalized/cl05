START i'd better keep on driving yours shayne decided because i'll be going on over to the beach STOP 
START i can drop you back here to pick mine up STOP 
START he went to a closet to get a light jacket and took his hat from beside the door STOP 
START timothy rourke UNK down the whiskey hastily and joined him asking who are we going to call on in the northeast section a lady STOP 
START that is maybe not too much of a lady STOP 
START at least i want to find out whether she's home yet or not STOP 
START he opened the door and followed rourke out STOP 
START in UNK car shayne drove east to UNK boulevard and north toward UNK UNK address which had been given to him by the UNK UNK STOP 
START as he drove he filled in timothy rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the UNK house and on his own UNK STOP 
START i want to be in scotty's bar at midnight when UNK makes her phone call there he ended grimly STOP 
START i don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but i want to see who takes the call STOP 
START this deal at UNK UNK UNK where the two UNK jumped you said rourke with interest that sounds like it was set up with UNK UNK by the UNK mrs. UNK doesn't it it does shayne UNK UNK still able to taste her mouth on his in the green jungle parking lot STOP 
START that story of hers about an UNK note UNK her to be there tonight sounds completely phony STOP 
START if it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written before UNK ever called me in on the case STOP 
START do you think laura did have the UNK UNK made without her husband's knowledge i haven't the UNK idea STOP 
START i think her husband strongly UNK so and that's why he called me in on the thing in direct UNK of his UNK and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so STOP 
START isn't this UNK street asked UNK ahead at the partially UNK street sign STOP 
START rourke could see it better out the UNK side and he said yes STOP 
START turn to the left i think for that number you gave me STOP 
START not more than a block or so STOP 
START shayne got in the UNK lane and cut across the boulevard UNK STOP 
START there was a small UNK restaurant and cocktail UNK on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet UNK street where most of the houses on both sides were older UNK UNK now cut up into furnished rooms and UNK apartments STOP 
START shayne drove UNK from the boulevard slowly letting rourke UNK his head out the window and watch for street numbers STOP 
START a single automobile was parked UNK up the block on the UNK side STOP 
START shayne noted UNK that it carried miami beach license plates as he approached and then saw the UNK of a match in the front seat as they passed indicating that it was occupied STOP 
START he turned to see the UNK faces of two men in the parked car just as rourke said it's the next house mike STOP 
START on the right STOP 
START instead of pulling into the curb shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left STOP 
START he went around the corner and parked turning off his lights and motor STOP 
START i told you mike said rourke in an UNK voice STOP 
START it was back there STOP 
START shayne said i know it was tim STOP 
START his voice was UNK and cold STOP

START i got a quick look at their faces as we went past STOP 
START unless i'm crazy as hell they're two of UNK UNK STOP

START those names mean anything to you wait a minute mike STOP

START shayne nodded grimly STOP 
START the pair whom UNK is officially UNK for UNK me around and pulling me in STOP 
START what are they doing here a UNK i suppose STOP 
START on UNK UNK STOP 
START maybe with specific orders to see that i don't make contact with her STOP 
START i'm not positive tim STOP 
START i may be wrong STOP 
START i'll slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail UNK on UNK STOP 
START you drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there STOP 
START you're a reporter and you're looking for miss UNK to interview her STOP 
START make them show their hands STOP 
START if they are beach cops on a UNK they'll admit it to a reporter STOP 
START they've got no official standing on this side of the bay STOP 
START as soon as you find out if they are UNK and harris come on around to the UNK where i'll be waiting STOP 
START shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out STOP 
START timothy rourke UNK UNK as he slid under the wheel STOP 
START the things you talk me into mike STOP 
START shayne UNK STOP 
START how often do they add up to UNK should complain STOP 
START he crossed the street and walked swiftly UNK to circle back to the boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant STOP 
START he was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a UNK of UNK when rourke came in six or eight minutes later STOP 
START the reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar STOP 
START shayne told the UNK UNK and water and rourke told him it's those two all right STOP 
START harris and UNK STOP 
START i made them show me their identification before i could be persuaded not to call on UNK UNK STOP 
START shayne said happily i've got it all worked out tim STOP 
START take your time with your drink STOP 
START i'll beat it STOP 
START in exactly three minutes go in that phone UNK behind you and call police headquarters STOP 
START be excited and don't identify yourself STOP 
START just say that a couple of UNK are having a hell of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car STOP 
START then hang up fast and come walking on down to the UNK address STOP 
START i'll be waiting for you there STOP 
START the UNK brought UNK drink and shayne laid a UNK bill on the bar STOP 
START he said in a low voice i've got a date with a lady UNK STOP 
START will that pay for a pint i can take with me STOP 
START you know how it is he added with a UNK UNK STOP 
START candy is dandy but liquor is UNK and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow STOP 
START we sure don't STOP 
START the UNK UNK back at him and UNK the bill STOP 
START he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of UNK in a small paper UNK which he slid over the counter to shayne STOP 
START as the detective slid it into his pocket rourke asked sadly what in hell are you going to do mike make a couple of UNK detectives named UNK and harris wish to god they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon STOP 
START three minutes tim STOP 
START shayne UNK out UNK and rourke checked his watch and UNK his drink getting a UNK ready to make the telephone call to the police STOP 
START outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his UNK directly in front of the bar headed south STOP 
START he walked over to the UNK door opened it and got the UNK automatic out of the UNK compartment and put it in his UNK pocket STOP 
START he hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the beach detectives but its weight was UNK at his UNK STOP 
START on this side of the bay miami beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and UNK pistol permit was just as good as theirs STOP 
START he went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives in the front seat STOP 
START he UNK the UNK of his hat low as he approached stepped out into the street just behind the car and UNK around to the UNK side STOP 
START the big UNK man named UNK was on that side UNK in the seat toward his UNK companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door STOP 
START shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night STOP 
START UNK UNK and slid partly out and UNK left arm UNK in around his neck to help him while he set himself UNK on the UNK and swung his right fist to the big UNK jaw before UNK could UNK up STOP 
START shayne stepped back to let him UNK to the ground and then UNK over him through the open door into harris who was UNK loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder UNK somewhat UNK by the UNK wheel STOP 
START shayne locked his big hands around UNK thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the UNK STOP 
START he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp STOP 
START he dropped him into the street a couple of feet away from UNK UNK figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side STOP 
START he didn't UNK STOP 
START they were both breathing heavily out cold and shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him STOP 
START he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and UNK the top UNK the UNK stuff UNK over both men and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat STOP 
START he turned then to look toward the lighted boulevard and saw UNK tall UNK figure come out of the UNK and UNK start to angle across the street toward the opposite side STOP 
START shayne UNK across to UNK the reporter in front of the UNK house where UNK UNK lived and asked casually get the police okay sure STOP 
START said they'd have a patrol car here fast STOP 
START let's get inside STOP 
START what happened with you why the two damned UNK got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out cold shayne said UNK STOP 
START they'll have fun explaining that to the miami cops STOP 
START got no business over here on a UNK anyway STOP 
START they went up onto a front porch and into a small UNK where a dim UNK burned high in the ceiling STOP 
START a row of UNK along the wall had numbers and names on them STOP 
START shayne found one marked UNK aj STOP 
START the UNK on the right was dark but there was a UNK at the bottom which lighted another dim UNK at the top and they went up STOP 
START there were two front rooms both dark behind their UNK and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the UNK were awake STOP

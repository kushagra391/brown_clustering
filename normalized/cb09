START mr. podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at UNK lake STOP 
START the narrow fringe of UNK that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure STOP 
START the evening was not always spent in the same way STOP 
START this year on a night cool with the front of september moving in but with plenty of summer still about the UNK were holding a neighborhood gathering in the UNK STOP 
START the little cottage was bursting with people of all ages STOP 
START in the midst of it all mr. podger came out on the UNK porch alone STOP 
START he had that day attended a country UNK and he had come back with a prize STOP 
START the prize was an UNK UNK cloth UNK complete with UNK UNK UNK side pieces and UNK for hanging STOP 
START mrs. podger had UNK pushed things around on the porch to make room for it and there it was UNK in a UNK corner the night breeze UNK its fringe with a slow UNK movement STOP 
START mr. podger sat down in it pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motions and then swung his feet up into it STOP 
START he closed his eyes and let the UNK drift of voices sweep UNK over him STOP 
START suddenly one young voice rose above the others STOP 
START but it said do you always know when you're happy voice sank back into the general UNK of sound but the question stayed in mr. UNK mind STOP 
START here in the cool UNK evening mr. podger mentally UNK a day that had left him greatly UNK and at peace STOP 
START it had begun with the blue jay UNK STOP 
START walking along the lake before breakfast mr. podger had seen the UNK and the bird that had lost it in flight STOP 
START the UNK spread of blue had gone on calling UNK into the wood STOP 
START the small shaft of blue had UNK down and come to rest at his feet STOP 
START all day long mr. podger who was a UNK man in the summer had worn the UNK in the band of his UNK UNK STOP 
START would a blue UNK in a man's hat make him happy all day STOP 
START but it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning UNK UNK the blue of the sky with the blue of the UNK by the lake STOP 
START then since the UNK was being held nearby he had walked to it STOP 
START and there on the way had been the box UNK that slow UNK UNK UNK of UNK bent for reasons best known to itself on crossing the road STOP 
START it was doing very well too having reached the center and was UNK its way with UNK UNK of purpose when mr. podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a UNK little sports car STOP 
START would the driver see the UNK he take pains to avoid it podger took no chances STOP 
START taking off his hat and UNK the driver with it mr. podger stepped into the road lifted the surprised UNK and UNK its UNK with what must have been a UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK immediately UNK into its private council room to study the phenomenon STOP 
START but mr. podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other STOP 
START here in the cool darkness mr. podger could still feel the warmth of UNK could still see the yellow UNK dancing over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young UNK face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car UNK out of sight STOP 
START where was the driver now was he doing the UNK podger smiled STOP 
START for a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama STOP 
START the three would never meet again but for some reason or other mr. podger was sure he would always remember the incident STOP 
START then there had been the UNK itself STOP 
START mr. podger heard again will the voice of the UNK the voices of the UNK and finally the small boy who had been so interested in mr. UNK UNK purchase STOP 
START i like them things too he had said STOP 
START we got one at home STOP 
START you know what you're UNK out in the UNK at night and it gets UNK cool you know you just take these sides with the fringe on see and UNK 'em right over you STOP 
START i do it lots o' times i like to lie in a UNK at night by myself when it's all quiet STOP 
START the wind moves it a little bit you know STOP 
START mr. podger had UNK him UNK and now he made use of the advice STOP 
START as he pulled the UNK sides up and made himself into a UNK mr. podger saw that thin attractive UNK little face again and hoped that the boy too was lying in a cool UNK quiet STOP 
START UNK the podger cat came by the UNK rubbed her back briefly against it and then sure of a welcome UNK up STOP 
START she remarked that she found the night wind a little UNK and mr. podger took her inside the fringe STOP 
START soon her UNK UNK the UNK of the tree UNK UNK the UNK of voices from inside the UNK STOP 
START mr. podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and UNK burst out STOP 
START dad said STOP 
START it's getting so UNK we've lighted a fire and we're going to tell a round UNK story a nice UNK one STOP 
START we need you to start it STOP 
START why are you out here all by yourself you happy podger opened his UNK and emerged UNK UNK under his arm to bring her in by the fire STOP 
START of course i am he said STOP 
START never happier in my life STOP 
START i just came out here to know it STOP 
START dallas as the south begins another school year national and even world attention is directed at the UNK slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools STOP 
START desegregation is beginning in two more important southern cities dallas and atlanta STOP 
START in each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the UNK of equal treatment STOP 
START these programs emphasize the acceptance of UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the programs do not take sides on the issue itself STOP 
START they point out simply that it is the law of the land STOP 
START the two cities have the examples of little rock and new orleans to hold up as UNK against UNK to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation STOP 
START even better they have the examples of UNK and houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs STOP 
START in each case there was an initial act of violence STOP 
START in UNK a school was UNK STOP 
START in houston there were a few incidents of friction between whites and negroes none of which were serious STOP 
START in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents STOP 
START the UNK plan incidentally has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled south STOP 
START it is a UNK plan in which desegregation begins in the first grade STOP 
START each year another grade is added to the process until finally all 12 grades are integrated STOP 
START the UNK are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more UNK or UNK that it is something that has to be done so why not now STOP 
START the program has worked well in both UNK and houston STOP 
START it met a serious UNK in new orleans where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were UNK by white parents STOP 
START another attempt will be made this year in new orleans to resume the program STOP 
START generally throughout the south there is a growing UNK with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met STOP 
START perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in dallas STOP 
START during the summer negroes began quietly UNK previously segregated restaurants and lunch UNK in downtown retail UNK STOP 
START it was part of a UNK move toward full integration STOP 
START so successful has been this program worked out by white and negro civic leaders that further UNK are expected in the next few months STOP 
START hotels for example are ready to let down the bars STOP 
START already at least one hotel has been quietly taking UNK on a UNK basis STOP 
START several UNK have been held in recent months in hotels on a UNK basis STOP 
START this is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which UNK several years ago when a series of UNK was directed against negroes who were moving into previously UNK neighborhoods of dallas STOP 
START it is also UNK of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the south STOP 
START southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop negroes from claiming equal rights STOP 
START they insist they are ashamed of such violence and UNK as occurred in alabama when the freedom riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus UNK STOP 
START all across the south there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a UNK attitude toward it STOP 
START there are many causes for this change STOP 
START one of the most important is economic STOP 
START business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any UNK of violence STOP 
START they are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order STOP 
START in the past these same southerners were inclined to look the other way STOP 
START and as the businessmen have begun to act a real sense of co-operation has UNK up STOP 
START this co-operation has UNK other southern whites to add their voices to demands for UNK UNK STOP 
START they realize that by acting in concert rather than individually they will not be picked out as objects of UNK economic and otherwise STOP 
START since moving from a chicago suburb to southern california a few months ago i've been introduced to a new game called UNK STOP 
START played mostly on the UNK around los angeles it goes like this a driver UNK easily at 70 UNK in lane a of a UNK UNK UNK an UNK traffic UNK ahead STOP 
START traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he UNK a tentative UNK into lane b which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 UNK STOP 
START the adjacent driver in lane b has three choices open to him STOP 
START he can 1 point his car UNK at the UNK UNK and force the other driver back into lane a 2 slow down and permit the UNK driver to change UNK 3 UNK UNK and UNK thus keeping the first driver UNK as to his intentions thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair STOP 
START the really remarkable thing to me is that most california natives UNK UNK to slow down and permit the UNK car free access STOP 
START whether or not this is done out of UNK UNK i don't know STOP 
START but it is done consistently and i'm both surprised and impressed STOP 
START this could never happen in my native chicago STOP 
START there such UNK UNK would be looked upon as a sure sign of UNK UNK STOP 
START in chicago the driver cut out would likely UNK his gas UNK to the floor in an effort to force the other car back STOP 
START failing this he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist UNK STOP 
START this negative explanation of UNK on the UNK however does an injustice to southern california drivers STOP 
START at the risk of losing my UNK at marshall field and company i would like to challenge an old and UNK stereotype STOP 
START after three months of research i can state UNK that los angeles drivers are considerably more UNK and competent than any other drivers i've ever encountered STOP 
START during one recent day of driving about los angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when UNK drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street STOP

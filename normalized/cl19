START slowly he pulled out the hand UNK until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly UNK from one station to another UNK in the null then draw in a line on the chart STOP 
START we're out just a little too far STOP 
START make a 90 degree straight for shore STOP 
START poet came in raising his UNK UNK as he saw elaine STOP 
START now asked STOP 
START pretty quick she replied STOP 
START will you drop the anchor nodded swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward UNK where he picked up the anchor STOP 
START the rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat UNK into the null on the aj STOP 
START reverse elaine said then peered through the loop of the UNK and waved to poet STOP 
START a second later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor STOP 
START she cut the engines and slowly the UNK swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore STOP 
START nick watched her somewhat UNK as she UNK cut the engines and started the UNK motor STOP 
START poet came up from below wearing new bathing UNK STOP 
START the price UNK hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the UNK and looked at it curiously STOP 
START nick wondered if elaine had bought them but he said nothing STOP 
START nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything STOP 
START it seemed as if they were all under a spell STOP 
START there should be an excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a UNK lost for more than four hundred years STOP 
START but instead of UNK there was a null like on the radio direction UNK STOP 
START once in new york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine STOP 
START they had all been laughing UNK when suddenly the engine had failed STOP 
START no one had screamed STOP 
START no one had prayed STOP 
START all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind UNK over the wings STOP 
START the pilot had been good STOP 
START he'd landed the plane on a small UNK in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had UNK to a stop everyone had burst into UNK at the same moment STOP 
START there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent tension similar to the one now STOP 
START but in the plane there was a concrete reason for it STOP 
START now at this moment there should be none unless skin UNK was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe STOP 
START yet tension existed STOP 
START the same UNK relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat STOP 
START it hung over them like a cloud its arrival as sudden as a cloud UNK over the sun STOP 
START silently elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet behind her nick UNK behind him STOP 
START she threw back a UNK over one of the seats unlocked a UNK on the chest beneath it then presently straightened holding a long knife and a UNK looking UNK gun in her hand STOP 
START poet UNK softly as he looked at the gun STOP 
START UNK asked STOP 
START elaine nodded STOP 
START they are the best STOP 
START she kicked the UNK lid shut and replaced the UNK STOP 
START they are the most efficient STOP 
START and the UNK poet commented as he UNK on his tank UNK STOP 
START why do you need an UNK asked UNK staring at the weapon STOP 
START it's quite possible there's more than UNK down there man poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held the UNK for elaine STOP 
START a moment later moving UNK because of the swimming UNK she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet then rolled off the transom of the boat back first STOP 
START poet nodded to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion STOP 
START another moment and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their UNK STOP 
START for a while nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from elaine STOP 
START they remained close together their air trail UNK like UNK traveling side by side STOP 
START eventually the bubbles became lost in the UNK of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back STOP 
START UNK his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky STOP 
START there was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean STOP 
START UNK certainly must have enjoyed being alone STOP 
START next to the ocean probably the UNK spot was the desert STOP 
START if UNK uncle had stuck to this desire for UNK he probably would still be alive STOP 
START yet UNK wanted money wanted money to UNK through the UNK STOP 
START and graham wanted money probably to UNK among the dice tables in UNK UNK STOP 
START it was an odd combination a strange pair to UNK upon the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START but graham hadn't stumbled on it STOP 
START two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham had been UNK around the san UNK UNK mission STOP 
START the small UNK with its two steel UNK UNK UNK and nick raised up to watch it heading south STOP 
START that was a hell of a note he thought STOP 
START a couple couldn't even find a UNK spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone UNK down upon them STOP 
START if the character flying that thing had gone over san UNK island yesterday he would have had an UNK STOP 
START off to the west a beautiful UNK slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a UNK toward san UNK STOP 
START behind it a cabin UNK UNK UNK in the small UNK a UNK UNK in the chair UNK STOP 
START the UNK was right in the middle of the deep STOP 
START nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in southern california were over the la UNK deep and the UNK deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the UNK STOP 
START someday UNK had warned the land on both sides of these UNK would fall into the ocean and no more la UNK or UNK beach STOP 
START meanwhile UNK took advantage of them to pull up UNK STOP 
START sometimes the fish UNK as they UNK the surface because of the difference in pressure STOP 
START why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip couldn't UNK he couldn't run a boat except on the open sea STOP 
START he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could see none STOP 
START UNK down to the UNK he lit the UNK under the coffee pot and when the UNK was heated poured himself a cup and went up to the UNK STOP 
START turning on the UNK he went back to the cockpit stretched out on the UNK and listened to the music STOP 
START elaine and poet returned together UNK up over the transom almost like UNK breaking water STOP 
START he sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern STOP 
START any luck asked STOP 
START poet shook his head sliding his face UNK up on his forehead STOP 
START we're right on the edge of the deep elaine said STOP 
START pulling off her face UNK she carefully placed the UNK gun across the stern then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water STOP 
START which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile she added as she swung her legs over the transom STOP 
START any news not a thing STOP 
START he tossed her a UNK then repeated the service for poet STOP 
START cigarette shook her head as she slipped out of her UNK but poet nodded STOP 
START his feet still hung over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in STOP 
START the UNK on his foot caught on the UNK throwing him off balance STOP 
START his UNK smashed painfully into the narrow UNK and he UNK as he grabbed his UNK UNK with his other hand and rolled into the boat STOP 
START UNK word UNK distinctly from poet's lips as he UNK to his feet STOP 
START UNK body became rigid STOP 
START turning slowly he saw poet in a brilliant UNK of horror STOP 
START poet face was still UNK in pain as he studied the UNK of his arm STOP 
START poet a murderer quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked surprise STOP 
START the sudden silence was too silent STOP 
START UNK aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his head slowly looking first at elaine STOP 
START she had caught the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START her face was frozen into the UNK of a UNK her body absolutely UNK STOP 
START and then nick knew that all of them knew elaine himself and poet STOP 
START elaine UNK first so quickly that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction STOP 
START do you need a UNK asked steadily STOP 
START poet rubbed his arm STOP 
START it's like UNK a UNK he said his eyes UNK on UNK face then moved back to elaine STOP 
START UNK like hell for a second then it UNK STOP 
START i'll get some UNK STOP 
START elaine turned and started toward the UNK STOP 
START but her walk was too steady too slow UNK her fear STOP 
START nick sensed it STOP 
START so did poet STOP 
START UNK like a cat he leaped back UNK up the spring gun and UNK pointed it toward the cabin STOP 
START at the same instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man STOP 
START the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious UNK like the first stroke of an old steam engine STOP 
START at the same instant elaine screamed wildly the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic struggling poet STOP 
START the moment the sea closed over nick some UNK sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic STOP 
START but the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage STOP 
START the wide UNK on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over STOP 
START poet was the captured arms UNK to his side and he twisted UNK trying to escape STOP 
START poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water STOP 
START but nick would not let go STOP 
START the rubber and glass face UNK slipped from poet's forehead bounced UNK off UNK chin then disappeared STOP 
START poet twisted again and UNK UNK UNK on the air tank UNK off the skin STOP 
START for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poet's UNK body spun completely around before nick could stop him holding him now from the rear STOP 
START something UNK at the side of UNK head as they rolled around and around STOP 
START suddenly poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water not rising not UNK STOP 
START a sharp pain UNK across UNK chest and a bubble of air escaped from his UNK lungs joining dozens of others that UNK UNK toward the surface like helium UNK rising into the sky STOP 
START a black UNK object UNK UNK in front of him UNK bubbles from its flat UNK head STOP 
START the air UNK was free discovery struck nick like a blow STOP 
START desperately nick flashed one hand up UNK poet's neck in the bend of his UNK STOP 
START at the same instant he grabbed the loose UNK UNK with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber UNK STOP 
START UNK he UNK through his nose then UNK in the air from the UNK STOP 
START at once the UNK pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden wild UNK STOP 
START as if this was a signal poet abruptly began to UNK the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water STOP 
START UNK nick held on UNK on the UNK UNK the air that belonged to poet STOP 
START poet was not fighting nick now STOP

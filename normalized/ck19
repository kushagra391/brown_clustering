START there was one fact which rector could not UNK one truth which he could not deny STOP 
START as long as there were two human beings working together on the same project there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave STOP 
START no matter how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the lord he could never UNK that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual STOP 
START all of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the lord but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the lord's servants STOP 
START it was only natural that UNK would UNK for a position in which he could make the decisions STOP 
START even rector himself was UNK to this spirit of competition and he knew it not for a more UNK office in the UNK of the church his ambitions for the UNK had died very early in his career but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel STOP 
START he was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two were UNK and could not be separated STOP 
START he wanted desperately to see UNK defeated the communists in the village UNK out the mission standing UNK for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be UNK too STOP 
START but perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan that man's ambition when linked with god would be a driving UNK force for good in the world STOP 
START he sighed STOP 
START how foolish it was to try to UNK the truth in an area where only faith would UNK STOP 
START he would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed STOP 
START his first move was to send hino to the village to spend a few days STOP 
START his arm had been giving him some trouble and rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had UNK UNK or whether hino was simply UNK against the UNK work in the print shop using the UNK in his arm as an excuse STOP 
START in any event rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what UNK was planning STOP 
START hino was UNK at the prospect STOP 
START he was allowed to spend his nights at an UNK near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the UNK parlor an excellent place to make contact with the enemy STOP 
START he left with all the UNK spirit of a child going on a holiday UNK UNK as rector gave him his final instructions STOP 
START he was to get involved in no arguments was to try to make no UNK was simply to listen and report back what he heard STOP 
START it was a ridiculous situation and rector knew it for hino frankly partisan openly UNK would make a poor UNK agent STOP 
START if he wanted to know anything he would end up asking about it UNK but in this UNK manner he would probably receive more UNK answers than if he tried to get them by UNK STOP 
START in all of his experience in the mission field rector had never seen a convert quite like hino STOP 
START from the moment that hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job any job his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand he had been ready to become a christian STOP 
START he had already been studying the bible knew the UNK and after studying with UNK for a time he approached rector announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that STOP 
START rector had never been able to find out much about UNK past STOP 
START hino talked very little about himself except for the UNK times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject STOP 
START putting the pieces of this UNK together rector had the vague UNK of a biography STOP 
START hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in UNK and divided his life between the land and the sea UNK the marginal UNK on his small UNK farm with UNK employment on a fishing boat STOP 
START without exception UNK brothers turned to either one or both of their father's UNK but hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired UNK and proved UNK popular as a UNK STOP 
START he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer had participated in one or two UNK he never went into detail regarding his military experience and at the age of twenty-five quite as a UNK out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a christian STOP 
START rector was often curious tempted to ask questions but he never did STOP 
START if and when hino decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so UNK STOP 
START rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village bursting with information ready to UNK it with his customary UNK UNK UNK with his active UNK STOP 
START when the telephone rang on the day after hino went down to the village rector had a UNK it would be hino with some UNK of information too important to wait until his return for there were few UNK in the village and the phone in UNK office rarely rang unless it was important STOP 
START he was surprised to find UNK secretary on the other end of the line STOP 
START he was even more startled when he heard what UNK wanted STOP 
START the UNK was entertaining a group of UNK the secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and UNK wished to show them the mission STOP 
START they had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it STOP 
START oh said STOP 
START i guess it will be all right STOP 
START when would the UNK like to bring his guests up here this afternoon the secretary said STOP 
START at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time STOP 
START all right rector said STOP 
START i will be expecting them STOP 
START he was about to hang up the phone but a note of UNK in the UNK voice left the conversation open STOP 
START he had something more to say STOP 
START i beg to UNK if the back is now safe for UNK he said STOP 
START rector laughed despite himself STOP 
START unless the UNK has been working on it he said then checked himself and added you can tell UNK that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START the secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone UNK in UNK hand STOP 
START rector had no idea why UNK wanted to visit the mission STOP 
START for the UNK to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all the available information it was probably the latter STOP 
START UNK must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily UNK by the people in the village STOP 
START at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity STOP 
START no UNK was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to UNK it until they arrived STOP 
START when he had given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask mrs. UNK to prepare tea and UNK for the visitors using the formal english china and the silver tea service which had been UNK to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds STOP 
START UNK had a pile of UNK near one side of the lawn STOP 
START rector asked him to move it for the time being wanted the mission compound to be UNK UNK STOP 
START a good initial impression would be important now STOP 
START he went into the print shop where UNK had just finished cleaning the press STOP 
START how many UNK do we have in stock said STOP 
START i should say about a hundred thousand UNK said STOP 
START why i would like to UNK a little UNK this afternoon rector said he explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create the picture of a very busy mission STOP 
START he did not wish to UNK UNK exactly just to display the mission activities in a UNK and impressive manner STOP 
START UNK nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would UNK the things rector requested STOP 
START UNK next stop was at the UNK where UNK was monitoring a test STOP 
START he UNK to her from the door and she slipped quietly outside STOP 
START he told her of the visitors and then of his plans STOP 
START how many children do you have present today said STOP 
START she looked back toward the UNK STOP 
START fifteen she said STOP 
START no only fourteen STOP 
START the little UNK girl had had to go home STOP 
START she has a pretty bad cold STOP 
START i would like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but UNK UNK full of life STOP 
START i want to create the impression of a compound full of children STOP 
START do you think you can manage it smiled STOP 
START i'll try STOP 
START as rector was walking back toward the residential hall johnson came out of the basement and UNK up to him STOP 
START the UNK in the coffee house had done little to UNK his spirits but he was still a little UNK around rector for they had not yet discussed the incident STOP 
START i think i've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time he said STOP 
START i've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low STOP 
START fine rector said STOP 
START he looked out over the UNK of the compound STOP 
START it was going to take a lot of activity to fill it STOP 
START have you ever operated a transit said STOP 
START no sir johnson said STOP 
START you are about to become a UNK UNK rector said STOP 
START when UNK gets back with the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boys STOP 
START UNK can help you STOP 
START you'll find an old transit in the basement STOP 
START the glass is out of it but that won't matter STOP 
START it looks pretty efficient and that's the important thing STOP 
START he went on to explain what he had in mind STOP 
START johnson nodded STOP 
START he said he could do it STOP 
START rector was UNK to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall STOP 
START it was rather a childish game all in all but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much STOP 
START he was not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it STOP 
START he was not going to lose the mission by UNK and whatever reason UNK had for bringing his little UNK group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise STOP 
START he found elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take charge of the office while the party was here STOP 
START when everything had been done rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock STOP 
START at two thirty he sent UNK to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first UNK the approach of UNK party STOP 
START then rector UNK in his best blue UNK suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a tree UNK a cigarette and waiting STOP 
START the air was cooler here and the UNK pattern of the trees threw a UNK shadow on the grass an effect which he found pleasant STOP

START UNK richard UNK had been UNK and UNK for almost a year STOP 
START his grades had gone steadily UNK and he had stopped bringing friends and UNK home from school STOP 
START mr. and mrs. UNK were puzzled and concerned STOP 
START then one day UNK UNK UNK from next door let the cat out of the bag STOP 
START the youngsters in the UNK class had UNK dick UNK UNK because his teeth UNK STOP 
START when UNK parents told him they wanted to take him to an UNK a dentist who UNK in UNK teeth and UNK their young son was interested STOP 
START during the year that followed dick UNK UNK with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his UNK appearance STOP 
START richard UNK is no special case STOP 
START the majority of children in the united states could benefit by some form of UNK treatment says dr. UNK g. UNK professor and head of the department of UNK at the university of illinois and a UNK recognized authority in his field STOP 
START what do parents need to know about those years of the UNK in order not to waste a child's time and their money can they tell whether a child needs UNK treatment and when should UNK be undertaken is it likely to cost fit explained UNK is the UNK expression for the way teeth fit together when the UNK are closed STOP 
START UNK or a bad fit is what parents need to look out for STOP 
START one main type of UNK is characterized by a UNK chin and UNK upper front teeth STOP 
START a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face a UNK forward of the lower front teeth an UNK lower UNK and an UNK upper jaw indicate the opposite type of UNK STOP 
START these two basic UNK have of course many variations STOP 
START a child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions a noticeable UNK of the upper or lower jaw STOP 
START UNK UNK twisted or widely UNK teeth STOP 
START front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close STOP 
START upper teeth completely covering the UNK when the back teeth close STOP 
START the UNK third from the middle on top counting each front tooth as the first beginning to UNK like UNK STOP 
START second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out making a double row STOP 
START contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago when all UNK was UNK on some unfortunate habit recent studies show that most tooth UNK has at least its beginning in UNK UNK STOP 
START however this does not mean that a child's teeth or UNK must necessarily UNK those of someone in his family STOP 
START tooth UNK may be the result of excessive UNK or UNK UNK or UNK but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive UNK habits STOP 
START it's perfectly normal for babies to UNK their UNK and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old STOP 
START occasional UNK up to the fifth year may not affect a UNK teeth after that if UNK pressure is frequent it will have an effect STOP 
START UNK can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long STOP 
START if a child loses a UNK at the age of two the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space thus UNK the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a UNK STOP 
START if baby teeth are retained too long the UNK second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to UNK in the wrong place STOP 
START UNK can save teeth every UNK sees children who are UNK by their UNK teeth STOP 
START some such youngsters rarely smile or they try to speak with the mouth closed STOP 
START in certain cases as in dick UNK a child's personality is affected STOP 
START yet from the UNK point of view UNK teeth should be UNK for physical reasons STOP 
START bad UNK may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the UNK structure that supports their roots STOP 
START this serious condition UNK known as UNK is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults STOP 
START then too UNK or UNK teeth are prone to UNK food particles increasing the UNK of rapid decay STOP 
START for these and other reasons says dr. UNK UNK can UNK the life of teeth STOP 
START the failure of teeth to fit together when closed UNK with normal chewing so that a child may UNK food whole and put a burden on his UNK system STOP 
START because of these chewing troubles a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate UNK STOP 
START badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech UNK as UNK STOP 
START the when and how of UNK most UNK work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 though there have been patients as young as two and as old as UNK says dr. UNK STOP 
START in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed yet the continuing growth of UNK tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy STOP 
START UNK work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not UNK by a system of UNK UNK with an involved nerve network to the bone in the jaw are not UNK directly to the bone STOP 
START UNK pressure applied over a period of time produces a change in the UNK UNK so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided STOP 
START what can UNK susan expect when she enters the UNK office her first visit the UNK will take UNK photographs tooth measurements and tooth UNK an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and UNK STOP 
START if he decides to proceed he will UNK for UNK an UNK consisting of bands plastic plates fine wires and tiny springs STOP 
START this UNK will exert a gentle and continuous or UNK pressure on the bone STOP 
START as the tooth moves bone cells on the pressure side of it will UNK and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved STOP 
START this must be done at the rate at which new UNK tissue grows and no faster STOP 
START if teeth are moved too rapidly serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place explains dr. UNK STOP 
START moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system and an UNK plan of treatment can UNK the growth pattern of a child's face STOP 
START during the first few days of wearing the UNK and immediately following each adjustment susan may have a slight UNK or UNK but after a short time this will disappear STOP 
START parents are often concerned that UNK UNK may cause teeth to decay STOP 
START when in place a UNK band actually UNK the part of the tooth that is covered STOP 
START next UNK will enter the treatment stage and visit the UNK once or twice a month depending on the UNK of her condition STOP 
START during these visits the dentist will adjust the UNK to increase the pressure on her teeth STOP 
START last comes the retention stage STOP 
START UNK teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position STOP 
START but because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position a UNK UNK is used to lock them in place STOP 
START usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the UNK and stretching across the teeth STOP 
START UNK may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day STOP 
START then comes the time when the last wire is removed and UNK walks out a UNK and more attractive girl than when she first went to the UNK STOP 
START how long will this take one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months STOP 
START UNK all the teeth may take a year or more STOP 
START an added UNK such as a UNK jaw may take two or three years to correct STOP 
START what is the cost charge for a complete UNK job UNK in various parts of the country STOP 
START work that might cost $500 to UNK in the south could cost UNK to UNK in new york city or chicago STOP 
START an average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be UNK to $1,000 STOP 
START factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the UNK says dr. UNK STOP 
START to become an UNK a man must first be UNK by his state as a dentist then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist STOP 
START costs may seem high but they used to be even higher says dr. UNK STOP 
START fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago STOP 
START the reason today are aware of the value of UNK and as a result there are more UNK in the field STOP 
START most UNK require an initial payment to cover the cost of UNK materials and construction of the UNK but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years STOP 
START in many cities in the united states UNK associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee STOP 
START some municipal agencies will pay for UNK treatment for children of UNK parents STOP 
START research helps families growth studies have been carried on consistently by UNK STOP 
START dr. UNK has UNK records of head growth started 20 minutes after children's UNK STOP 
START in the past anyone who said that UNK of all UNK is UNK was UNK at we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent he says STOP 
START fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does and that helps us know what we can do STOP 
START this knowledge both UNK and UNK diagnosis and treatment STOP 
START for example a boy may UNK a small jaw from one UNK and large teeth from another STOP 
START in the past an UNK might have tried over four or five years to UNK and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that despite some growth would never accommodate them STOP 
START now a dentist can recommend UNK immediately STOP 
START in other cases in view of present-day knowledge of head growth UNK will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment STOP 
START the child is kept on call and the UNK UNK the growth STOP 
START nature often takes care of the problem says dr. UNK STOP 
START a child with a certain type of head and teeth will UNK tooth UNK STOP 
START that is why dr. UNK asks parents not to insist against their UNK advice that their child have UNK work done too early STOP 
START both because of our UNK stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so STOP 
START let the UNK decide the proper time to start treatment he UNK STOP 
START superior new material for UNK work is another result of research STOP 
START plastics are easier to handle than the UNK rubber formerly used and they save time and money STOP 
START plaster of paris once UNK in making impressions of teeth has been replaced by UNK UNK material that work quickly and accurately and with least UNK to a child STOP 
START prevention is best as a rule the earlier general dental treatment is started the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be STOP 
START after your child's baby teeth are all in usually at the age of two and one half to three it's time for that first dental appointment dr. UNK UNK STOP 
START then see that your UNK has a routine UNK once a year STOP 
START to help prevent UNK problems from arising your dentist can do these things he can correct decay thus UNK early loss of teeth STOP 
START if a child does lose his first teeth UNK because of decay and if no preventive steps are taken the other teeth may shift out of position become UNK and UNK STOP 
START in turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become UNK in them STOP

START this time he was making no mistake STOP 
START UNK in her country the UNK was a UNK form of address was not only attractive but UNK durable sensible and smart STOP 
START no wonder wright was UNK no two better suited people ever met STOP 
START almost from that day until his death UNK was to stay at his side the years that immediately followed were to be UNK trying both for wright and his UNK lady STOP 
START it must be granted that the UNK of convention no matter how well UNK one may be is sure to lead to trouble or at least to the UNK that goes with social disapproval STOP 
START even so many of the things that happened to wright and UNK seem UNK severe STOP 
START their UNK centered on one UNK difficulty miriam held up the divorce proceedings that she herself had asked for STOP 
START reporters began to trail miriam everywhere and to encourage her to make UNK statements about wright and his UNK STOP 
START UNK of UNK UNK and unpleasant legal papers of every sort began to fly through the air STOP 
START the UNK miriam would agree to a settlement through her legal representative then change her mind and make another attack on wright as a person STOP 
START at last her lawyer arthur d. cloud gave up the case because she turned down three successive UNK he arranged STOP 
START cloud made an interesting statement in UNK from his client i wanted to be a lawyer and mrs. wright wanted me to be an UNK angel STOP 
START so i got out STOP 
START mrs. wright is without funds STOP 
START the first thing to do is get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final disposition of the case STOP 
START but every time i suggested this to her mrs. wright turned it down and demanded that i go out and UNK mr. wright STOP 
START i am an attorney not an instrument of UNK STOP 
START miriam UNK UNK the free advice of her UNK UNK and appointed a UNK young man named harold jackson to take his place STOP 
START there were three years of this strange warfare during the unhappy time miriam often would charge that wright and UNK were UNK against the public order of wisconsin STOP 
START yet somehow when officers were UNK into visiting taliesin to UNK the UNK they would find neither wright nor UNK at home STOP 
START this showed that common sense had not died out at the county and village level though why the unhappy and obviously UNK woman was not restrained remains a UNK STOP 
START the misery of UNK bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case it was hopeless UNK and destructive with miriam herself bearing the UNK burden of shame and pain STOP 
START to get an idea of the UNK and UNK that was UNK upon wright and UNK we should bear in mind that the UNK were sometimes led by miriam in person STOP 
START one of the most UNK of these scenes occurred at spring green toward the end of the open warfare on a beautiful day in june STOP 
START at this time miriam UNK appeared UNK on UNK henry UNK whose name showed him to be a UNK of the UNK settlers in the neighborhood STOP 
START a troop of reporters brought up the rear STOP 
START miriam was stopped at the taliesin gate and william UNK now the estate UNK came out to UNK STOP 
START he said that mr. wright was not in and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant that miriam was waving in the air STOP 
START miriam now ordered UNK to break down the gate but he said he really couldn't go that far STOP 
START at this point mrs. UNK UNK one of UNK handsome daughters by his first wife came from the house and tried to calm miriam as she tore down a no visitors sign and smashed the glass UNK on another sign with a rock STOP 
START miriam UNK wright said here i am at my own home locked out so i must stand in the road she rounded on UNK and cried you always did UNK dirty work i take over taliesin the first thing i'll do is fire you STOP 
START madame UNK i think you had better go said mrs. UNK STOP 
START and i think you had better leave replied miriam STOP 
START turning to the reporters she asked did you hear her i think you had better leave this is my own home STOP 
START in the silence that followed miriam walked close to mrs. UNK who drew back a step on her side of the gate STOP 
START then with staring eyes and lips drawn thin miriam said to the young woman you are ugly UNK than you used to be and you were always very ugly STOP 
START you are even UNK than mr. wright STOP 
START the UNK expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a natural force it gave miriam UNK a fund of energy like that of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art STOP 
START as if to make certain that wright would be unable to pay any settlement at all miriam wrote to prospective UNK UNK him also went to washington and appealed to senator george william UNK of UNK the fighting liberal from whose office a sympathetic but UNK UNK was heard STOP 
START then after UNK to accept a settlement and go through with a divorce miriam gave a UNK UNK of mrs. UNK by suddenly stating i will never leave mr. wright STOP 
START under this kind of pressure it is not surprising that wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers STOP 
START miriam had not yet UNK him into UNK her directly but one can feel the UNK anger in UNK remarks to reporters when he was asked one morning on arrival in chicago what he thought of the city as a whole STOP 
START first wright said he was UNK by the smoke which fortunately kept him from seeing the UNK town STOP 
START but surely michigan avenue was handsome that isn't a boulevard it's a UNK wright showing that automobiles were considered to be a danger as early as the UNK STOP 
START this is a horrible way to live wright went on STOP 
START you are being UNK by traffic STOP 
START he was then asked for a solution of the difficulty and began to talk UNK sense though private UNK showed through in the UNK of his manner STOP 
START take a UNK knife and sweep it over the loop wright said STOP 
START cut off every building at the seventh floor STOP 
START spread everything out STOP 
START you don't need concentration STOP 
START if you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic UNK STOP 
START you'll have trees again STOP 
START you'll have some joy in the life of this city STOP 
START after all that's the job of the architect to give the world a little joy STOP 
START little enough joy was afforded wright in the spring of UNK when another destructive fire broke out at taliesin STOP 
START the first news stories had it that this UNK was started by a UNK of lightning as though miriam could call down fire from heaven like a UNK of the old testament STOP 
START a storm did take place that night and fortunately enough it included a UNK that helped put out the flames STOP 
START later accounts UNK UNK UNK for starting the fire any rate heat grew so intense in the main part of the house that it UNK the window UNK and UNK the UNK pottery to UNK STOP 
START wright set his loss at UNK a figure perhaps justified by the unique character of the house that had been ruined and the UNK taste that had gone into the selection of the UNK and other things that were destroyed STOP 
START in spite of the disaster wright completed during this period plans for the lake UNK resort in which he suggested the shapes of american indian UNK a project of great and appropriate charm that came to nothing STOP 
START amid a shortage of profitable work the memory of albert UNK UNK stood out in lonely UNK the money had quickly UNK away STOP 
START a series of conferences with friends and bankers began about this time the question before these meetings was here is a man of international reputation and proved UNK power can he be financed so that he can find the work he ought to do this was under consideration UNK as ever wright set about the building of taliesin 3 STOP 
START as he made plans for the new taliesin wright also got on paper his conception of a UNK of steel and glass to house a congregation of all UNK and the idea for a UNK with a UNK UNK STOP 
START years were to pass before these plans came off the paper and wright was justified in thinking as the projects failed that much of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except by visitors to taliesin STOP 
START and now there was some question as to his continued residence there STOP 
START billy UNK who had once worked for wright as a UNK gave a UNK for UNK use that he had seen UNK living at taliesin STOP 
START this might put wright in such a bad light before a court that miriam would be awarded taliesin was she moved by a letter from wright pointing out that if he was not compelled to spend money on useless UNK bills useless hotel bills and useless doctor's bills he could more quickly provide miriam with a suitable home either in los angeles or paris as she preferred STOP 
START miriam UNK at this and complained that wright had said UNK things about her to reporters STOP 
START his reply was everything that has been printed UNK to you UNK to have come from me was a UNK and nothing yet has been printed which i have UNK STOP 
START what UNK miriam was that wright had told the papers about a reasonable offer he had made which he considered she would accept when she tires of publicity STOP 
START from her california headquarters miriam fired back i shall never divorce mr. wright to permit him to marry UNK UNK STOP 
START then miriam varied the UNK psychological warfare by suddenly UNK a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending and asking for divorce on the grounds of cruelty with the understanding that wright would not contest it STOP 
START the bank of wisconsin sent a representative to the UNK chambers in madison to give information on UNK ability to meet the terms STOP 
START he said that the architect might reasonably be expected to carry his financial UNK if all UNK could be brought to an end and that the bank would accept a mortgage on taliesin to help bring this about STOP 
START miriam said that she must be assured that that other woman UNK will not be in luxury while i am UNK along STOP 
START this exhausted UNK patience and in consequence he talked freely to reporters in a madison hotel suite STOP 
START UNK laws speed laws divorce laws he said as they now stand UNK the individual make UNK and law UNK of us in one way or another and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd STOP 
START if mrs. wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning i'll go either to tokyo or to UNK to do what i can STOP 
START i realize in taking this stand just what it means to me and mine STOP 
START here wright gave a slight sigh of UNK and continued it means more long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people making shift to live in the face of popular UNK and misunderstanding as i best can for myself and those dependent upon me STOP 
START next day word came that miriam was not going through with the divorce wright stayed in the united states STOP 
START his UNK of japan and UNK had been merely the expression of UNK thinking STOP 
START no matter what troubles might UNK him this most american of artists knew in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land STOP 
START in a few weeks miriam made another UNK at taliesin but was UNK at the locked and UNK gates STOP

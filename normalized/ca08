START they UNK at UNK miles dr. STOP 
START washington thousands of UNK seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big UNK parade on jan. 20 STOP 
START assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this UNK as president john f. kennedy and UNK president dwight d. eisenhower leave capitol hill following the UNK ceremonies and ride down this historic UNK route STOP 
START pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original 13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint STOP 
START but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it STOP 
START many buildings within view of the avenue are some of the united states government's tremendous buildings plus UNK and UNK STOP 
START of course UNK pennsylvania the white house is the most famous address of the free world STOP 
START within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about UNK high STOP 
START great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about UNK years old STOP 
START in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch UNK women parade STOP 
START they were the UNK and they wanted to vote STOP 
START in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time STOP 
START seats on square along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in UNK is the national UNK building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept STOP 
START also the department of justice building is located where j. UNK UNK UNK over the federal bureau of investigation STOP 
START street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania UNK with lines that are underground STOP 
START many spectators will be UNK seats and UNK points UNK lafayette square opposite the white house STOP 
START in this historic square are several UNK but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen. andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans STOP 
START moving past the presidential UNK stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units STOP 
START about UNK military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade STOP 
START division one of the parade will be the service UNK STOP 
START division two will include the UNK of massachusetts and texas the respective states of the president and of vice-president l. b. johnson STOP 
START then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union STOP 
START division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states four will be headed by the navy followed by 11 states five by the air force followed by 11 states STOP 
START division six will be headed by the coast guard followed by the reserve forces of all services five states puerto rico the virgin islands guam american UNK the trust UNK and the UNK zone STOP 
START jackson UNK what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in UNK into the state's immediate political future STOP 
START this is largely because of the UNK of the man who operates the UNK of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants gov. ross barnett STOP 
START barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his UNK UNK but his friends as well STOP 
START consequently it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year STOP 
START could be UNK some UNK the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far STOP 
START the UNK UNK of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of UNK and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his UNK quest for the governor's office STOP 
START there are many who UNK that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a UNK STOP 
START certainly nobody will UNK that the next time the UNK come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a UNK of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session STOP 
START if barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session STOP 
START the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year STOP 
START districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the UNK or the UNK per UNK is not certain and if they start UNK STOP 
START barnett is not expected to be able to UNK the pressure STOP 
START the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat STOP 
START with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic UNK district and congressman frank e. smith as the one most likely to go the UNK battle will put to a test the UNK power which UNK from the UNK have held in the legislature STOP 
START UNK relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house STOP 
START split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party UNK and UNK the democratic party in mississippi is currently a UNK STOP 
START and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together STOP 
START future UNK barnett as the UNK head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to UNK relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the UNK ranks to completely UNK him as a party UNK STOP 
START with a democratic administration party UNK would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election STOP 
START now the picture is UNK and even us UNK james o. UNK and john c. UNK who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status STOP 
START reports are that it is more than probable that the four UNK from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual UNK which UNK to UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK the gov. UNK h. davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses STOP 
START the year will probably start out with UNK still the most UNK issue STOP 
START but it might give way shortly to another UNK issue that of UNK in state government STOP 
START the transition from UNK to UNK might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to UNK the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent STOP 
START the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the UNK strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program STOP 
START but the UNK of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to UNK STOP 
START legislators weary indeed the UNK curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat STOP 
START the administration could not say why UNK million was needed for a UNK program STOP 
START the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the UNK UNK about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can UNK the required two-thirds vote STOP 
START the tax bill will be up for UNK wednesday in the house when the legislature UNK STOP 
START davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to UNK STOP 
START if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration STOP 
START he could terminate special sessions of the legislature STOP 
START actually davis would have to UNK in the UNK soon anyway STOP 
START many legislators are already weary and UNK over the UNK losing battle to block UNK integration STOP 
START this is not the sort of thing most UNK would care to acknowledge publicly STOP 
START they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be UNK STOP 
START underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition STOP 
START he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle STOP 
START then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the UNK million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period STOP 
START it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that UNK million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one STOP 
START but if the administration should find it does not need the UNK million for a UNK program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes STOP 
START this would be in perfect UNK with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash STOP 
START it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year STOP 
START if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma STOP 
START since the constitution UNK introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or UNK its estimates of anticipated revenues STOP 
START constant problem in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another UNK at raising additional revenues through a tax UNK STOP 
START the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor STOP 
START it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem STOP 
START but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature STOP 
START this might be done to UNK those who have been squeezed out by the UNK to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more UNK to a tax proposal later in the year STOP 
START a constant problem UNK davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his UNK that he has not tried to UNK STOP 
START any tax bill also will UNK UNK that some of his followers have been using their administration UNK UNK to profit themselves STOP 
START the new year might see some UNK either genuine or UNK depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms STOP

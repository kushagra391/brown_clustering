START when bobbie UNK smashed up his car the UNK his wife linda had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly with it driving back from an UNK golf at UNK it seemed to mark the end of a long UNK chapter in the social life of the community STOP 
START linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone held his or her breath STOP 
START not that linda was UNK not that she would do anything UNK or in bad taste any more than john cooper would STOP 
START hadn't linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years john cooper even more attractive at UNK than he had been twenty-five years earlier wasn't john's wife edythe even more UNK if possible john cooper after all this time deserve something better of life it adult and realistic to look at it that way romantic knew that john cooper had married edythe on the UNK STOP 
START it was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life and it was a tribute to john's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his STOP 
START of course there was nothing you could do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen UNK chandler said to linda stuart STOP 
START poor john accepted the UNK which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of UNK when she was by all odds the UNK and UNK young woman west of the UNK mountains and john was surely one of the UNK and UNK young men around pittsburgh STOP 
START for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the UNK UNK not only of the UNK line but even of her fellow UNK STOP 
START john had claimed her from the UNK line a young man a year out of dartmouth with UNK UNK still around his eyes STOP 
START you saw them always together those years STOP 
START you talked about UNK as an UNK STOP 
START UNK were at UNK UNK last night drove to UNK in three and a half hours STOP 
START then there was a UNK over something as there had been UNK UNK before this one didn't UNK STOP 
START you still said UNK but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or UNK STOP 
START it got worse instead of better STOP 
START first it came out after mr. UNK will was settled he had died the year before that john and his mother weren't rich any more STOP 
START and then there was UNK engagement to bobbie UNK STOP 
START there was no connection between the two events because bobbie wasn't rich either though he was more aggressive than john STOP 
START he was a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same steel company as john did STOP 
START some people said linda had just announced the engagement to UNK john into some action but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe his bride it could no longer be UNK even to sentimental UNK UNK STOP 
START it wasn't even john and edythe STOP 
START it was simply poor john STOP 
START there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe but there was absolutely nothing right about her either STOP 
START UNK chandler had been to school with her UNK near baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at UNK STOP 
START well you shouldn't UNK edythe UNK said STOP 
START i know she gives the impression of being shallow and UNK and UNK STOP 
START she is UNK and UNK but she really isn't shallow STOP 
START bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding STOP 
START john was at the church with edythe STOP 
START she UNK during the ceremony and UNK chandler who was one of UNK UNK said john UNK black as death at her STOP 
START as if he were UNK she said STOP 
START poor john settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example STOP 
START her hair never seemed to be in place and her UNK were never quite the correct length STOP 
START she didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at UNK UNK but her bathing suits were far from smart STOP 
START and you didn't see her much at UNK UNK or anywhere for john had UNK away from the gang STOP 
START UNK said it was because he was too proud to stand pity STOP 
START others thought he couldn't stand seeing linda mrs. bobbie UNK still so beautiful so much in command of everything STOP 
START there were UNK reasons too STOP 
START john's mother died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money left STOP 
START john sold the big old place in UNK and bought a smaller house in fox chapel STOP 
START he was not reduced to poverty but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day STOP 
START john was good at his job STOP 
START it probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the UNK with nothing but edythe to come home to STOP 
START though that may be unfair since ben cooper john's first son came along early in UNK the UNK baby you ever saw and a UNK that he looked all cooper from UNK to pink toes UNK a trace of edythe STOP 
START but the continuing charm of the other children sally in 1940 and jack in 1944 and all john's success at his work only made UNK UNK and general UNK more UNK STOP 
START she never could fit into a crowd which had known which still knew and admired linda STOP 
START when there was bridge at UNK house the cards UNK like wet graham UNK and the food probably was wet graham UNK STOP 
START she managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr. UNK the UNK elder UNK never UNK more than five dollars to anything had to UNK up five hundred dollars to avoid a UNK in what edythe called the UNK of the church STOP 
START john did find the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually UNK which was a real bit of luck for the UNK STOP 
START being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile STOP 
START poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a UNK without UNK and maybe UNK over backward to keep a bad one STOP 
START he was an UNK and generous husband UNK a lot of people felt because they knew that money must be a problem to him STOP 
START but he got ahead in business on leave from his job to an important washington assignment during the war the war back to the UNK UNK of the steel company STOP 
START the UNK saw bobbie and linda socially but no more than was necessary STOP 
START bobbie had been successful too though he didn't match john's pace and after all he didn't need to with all the stuart money STOP 
START he and linda settled down to being social leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year STOP 
START and then came the UNK turn the smashed UNK and linda UNK alone and lovely STOP 
START everyone held his or her breath STOP 
START don't think linda couldn't have got john back any time if she'd tried UNK UNK who had been UNK chandler said between UNK of a chicken UNK at a luncheon table at le UNK STOP 
START now you know she UNK but she isn't that kind of girl STOP 
START but now well it would be a UNK i think STOP 
START poor john STOP 
START linda UNK felt more UNK than she had ever dreamed UNK death could move her to feeling STOP 
START what she felt was a UNK loss with a sense of waste to it not so much UNK for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death STOP 
START she knew what people were thinking was what she had been thinking herself STOP 
START it was up to her to save poor john dear john to UNK the wrong she had done but she UNK at the decision as at the UNK of a cold stream STOP 
START there was no one who would blame her or john could be sure of that STOP 
START it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to UNK her to send her back to cleveland or anywhere STOP 
START and linda felt capable of UNK the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie had had none of their own STOP 
START it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of STOP 
START linda would have to wait she knew STOP 
START but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by of watching while poor john UNK without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead STOP 
START of course he had done UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and regular UNK had different sales departments at smith UNK where john and bobbie both worked STOP 
START bobbie had been head of the UNK division while john was just another good salesman in the regular branch STOP 
START so when old mr. UNK the company president talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular UNK had gone with UNK it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie STOP 
START for linda knew how to help her husband not just the UNK contacts but also the little UNK for UNK UNK STOP 
START she was almost sick when bobbie came home with the news that poor john had won the job STOP 
START what did you do asked bobbie STOP 
START you must have done something something wrong STOP 
START lord knows i had everything set for you STOP 
START bobbie said something about damned UNK UNK together and linda got angry at him STOP 
START they had their first real fight and bobbie went off to get drunk STOP 
START linda UNK her uncle donald UNK into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened STOP 
START he was a director of s. m. and must have been in on the decision STOP 
START but UNK old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in a large company which UNK and even some UNK couldn't understand STOP 
START he didn't tell her of the long board meeting where bobbie and john were weighed one against the other STOP 
START i'm behind john cooper mr. UNK said finally STOP 
START i think we're agreed that he and UNK are equal in ability so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive STOP 
START now i believe poor UNK work just a little harder STOP 
START with that wife of his i think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance STOP 
START bobbie with linda behind him will have plenty of other opportunities STOP 
START and also the money can't mean as much to bobbie STOP 
START bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it john will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights UNK about us STOP 
START most of the directors nodded STOP 
START uncle donald UNK found himself UNK agreement too STOP 
START after the surprise was over linda was almost as pleased as anyone with john's good luck though she agreed with UNK decision some months later to move to UNK UNK STOP 
START the job at UNK wasn't particularly better but it got him away from being UNK to john and assured him steady UNK since UNK was owned to a large degree by various branches of UNK family STOP 
START poor john's rise continued to be UNK STOP 
START when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future STOP

START an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts STOP 
START first is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning and discussion STOP 
START preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural UNK STOP 
START all political interests supported electoral planning although there are some signs that the inherent UNK of a popular judgment led to some UNK STOP 
START the second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration nomination and voting STOP 
START considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above UNK STOP 
START however the UNK UNK results which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems of developing UNK under even the most favorable circumstances STOP 
START a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy is the results of the election STOP 
START the electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party UNK but all UNK interested parties including the government itself were UNK engaged in determining the party UNK of all successful candidates the month following the elections STOP 
START the fourth and UNK point will be to estimate the UNK significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics STOP 
START elections have figured UNK in nearly every government program and official address since independence STOP 
START they were stressed in the speeches of UNK UNK UNK when the first council of ministers was formed and again when the UNK took a leading role in the second council STOP 
START king UNK 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local UNK and made the first firm promise of elections on may day 1957 STOP 
START there followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the UNK of elections for the fall of 1957 in which it appears that the minister of the interior took the most UNK view and that the UNK was something less than enthusiastic STOP 
START since the complicated process of establishing new UNK and UNK the UNK plan left by the french did not even begin until the fall of 1957 this goal appears somewhat ambitious STOP 
START from the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in UNK politics precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government STOP 
START until the charter of UNK was issued in the fall of 1958 there were no UNK of the right to UNK or to organize for political purposes STOP 
START the UNK was still firmly united in 1957 but the UNK UNK UNK de UNK the most important minor party at the time objected to the UNK UNK in the civil service and influence in radio UNK STOP 
START there were UNK that the ministry of the interior favored an arbitrary UNK process which were indirectly UNK when the king personally UNK in the planned meetings STOP 
START the day following his intervention the palace issued a statement UNK the citizens that the possibility of UNK appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists lists of candidates and finally the holding of the UNK itself would be supported by the king himself STOP 
START the UNK crisis in the fall of 1957 UNK further consideration of elections but french UNK were called in and UNK of further investigation appeared from time to time STOP 
START in january 1958 the minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the king the UNK of election dates appeared once again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer STOP 
START although the government was probably prepared for elections by UNK the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party UNK UNK STOP 
START in late 1957 the UNK UNK UNK appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal UNK of the UNK was revealed when the third council of government under UNK was formed without support from progressive elements in the party STOP 
START the parties were on the whole UNK for elections while the people were still UNK UNK UNK and suffering the UNK of poor UNK in 1957 STOP 
START despite the internal and international crises that UNK UNK the elections remained a central issue STOP 
START they figured UNK in the UNK government of may 1958 which the king was UNK determined to keep in office until elections could be held STOP 
START but the eagerly sought UNK of the UNK council of government was never achieved as the UNK UNK over foreign policy labor politics and economic development STOP 
START by december 1958 when UNK UNK became president of the council elections had even greater importance STOP 
START they were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural UNK as the focus of a new constructive national effort STOP 
START to minimize the chances of UNK the UNK UNK the UNK government was formed STOP 
START a UNK personnel and a special office was created in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections STOP 
START by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete STOP 
START there remained only the delicate task of UNK the laws through the UNK of palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions STOP 
START from the rather UNK history of electoral planning in UNK an important point UNK concerning the first elections in a developing country and UNK their results STOP 
START in the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of UNK fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance STOP 
START in the absence of a UNK of political UNK each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new UNK but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent STOP 
START lacking the respected and effective institutions that UNK helps provide minority parties such as the UNK in 1957 and the progressive UNK UNK in 1958 UNK for elections when out of power but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power STOP 
START those in power tend to UNK and even to UNK the electoral process STOP 
START the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of UNK rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in UNK STOP 
START at the central level the UNK UNK voting system was selected over some form of the UNK de UNK system even though the latter had been recommended by UNK and favored by all political parties STOP 
START the choice of the single member district was UNK to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections STOP 
START although the elections were for local officials it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly UNK their candidates STOP 
START with multiple member districts the still UNK local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly STOP 
START both parties and the ministry of the interior were UNK at work after the elections trying to UNK the political UNK of the successful candidates and thereby give the elections a UNK but known degree of national political significance STOP 
START since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to UNK party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation STOP 
START the general setting of the UNK election may also encourage the UNK of local party organization STOP 
START the concentration of effective power in UNK leads not only to party UNK but to UNK from local activity that might have had many UNK benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections STOP 
START interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber of commerce elections which took place three weeks before national elections STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK et UNK was opposed by candidates of the new UNK UNK national UNK forces UNK in nearly all urban centers STOP 
START as the more conservative group with strong UNK from wealthy businessmen the UNK was generally favored against the more progressive UNK UNK STOP 
START the newer party UNK heavily while the older more confident party expected the UNK merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years STOP 
START the local UNK and UNK offices did not campaign and lost heavily STOP 
START the value of the elections was lost both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable UNK of commercial interest as shown in table 1 STOP 
START the chamber of commerce elections were of course an important event in the preparation for rural UNK elections STOP 
START the UNK learned that its urban organization which depends heavily on UNK support was most effective STOP 
START the UNK found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily UNK to the more concrete precise problems of internal politics STOP 
START the overall effect was probably to UNK more party activity in the UNK elections than might have otherwise taken place STOP 
START a second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections STOP 
START although a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated STOP 
START furthermore the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to UNK election results STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK of the elections was naturally an UNK and UNK procedure STOP 
START as the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly UNK elections STOP 
START the UNK and later the popular movement protected the UNK UNK position until the fall of UNK and then the UNK used the same argument which it had previously ignored against the UNK UNK of the UNK government STOP 
START the bulk of the preparation had of course proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior whose officials are UNK from party activity and probably generally UNK in party politics STOP 
START apart from some areas of UNK trouble like UNK UNK where UNK officials had been appointed there is little evidence that local officials UNK in the electoral process STOP 
START UNK however the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely an unfair advantage STOP 
START the king decided to remove UNK a week before elections and to institute a UNK council of government under his personal direction STOP 
START although the UNK had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance his action was an implicit admission that party UNK were a factor STOP 
START the new council was itself UNK of political meaning which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any UNK members and the presence of several UNK leaders STOP 
START since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have been more important as an indication of royal UNK with the UNK STOP 
START voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 although the actual UNK and planning for the rural UNK was completed in 1958 STOP 
START there were three major administrative tasks the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the registration of candidates STOP 
START UNK registration began in late november 1959 and continued until early january 1960 STOP 
START the government was most anxious that there be a respectable response STOP 
START UNK UNK of the UNK in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among UNK officials STOP 
START a goal was fixed as given in table 2 and attention focused on its fulfillment STOP 
START the qualifications to vote were kept very simple STOP 
START both men and women of UNK years of age could register and vote upon UNK proof of residence and identification STOP 
START there were liberal provisions for UNK where documents or records were lacking STOP 
START the police were UNK along with certain categories of UNK citizens UNK and those UNK for UNK activities STOP 
START the registration figures given in table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible UNK were made without the benefit of a reliable census STOP

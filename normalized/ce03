START five four three two one fire tremendous energy released by giant UNK engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard STOP 
START the UNK UNK of energy UNK at the pit of your stomach STOP 
START never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear STOP 
START nuclear weapons are UNK but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a UNK and UNK UNK which is much more UNK STOP 
START a great many writers are UNK by the apparently overwhelming advantage an UNK would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets STOP 
START it is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an UNK in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously destroy his UNK cities and people STOP 
START with a nation UNK before it why would the UNK spare the UNK people the UNK destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete UNK nation would be utterly UNK STOP 
START the will of its people so crucial in time of UNK would be broken STOP 
START nuclear weapons have given the world the means for UNK in hours or days now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes STOP 
START at this point it should be painfully obvious that cities being soft and the people within them are UNK suited to destruction by nuclear weapons STOP 
START however because this UNK is mutual it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the UNK cities at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect UNK STOP 
START it should be UNK apparent that UNK is not a profitable military UNK STOP 
START UNK have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways STOP 
START they could be used to attack a nation's people which would inevitably mean the loss of the UNK own people or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the UNK military force STOP 
START if our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than UNK national suicide then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles STOP 
START we must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves STOP 
START we must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile STOP 
START missiles are very valuable weapons but they also have their too little known limitations STOP 
START because of a UNK ballistic UNK the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately STOP 
START placing missiles in submarines on UNK railroads highways surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the UNK weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons STOP 
START one must first UNK a UNK mobile or moving target decide that it is worthy of destruction select the missile to be fired against the target UNK UNK for the flight and prepare the missile for firing STOP 
START even if all these operations could be performed UNK the UNK still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes STOP 
START therefore if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes the probability of having destroyed it is UNK lowered STOP 
START because of this it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek UNK in UNK at least until missile defenses are UNK which have an UNK high kill probability STOP 
START in order to destroy the UNK mobile moving or UNK located strategic forces we must have a UNK capability in addition to our missiles STOP 
START until this UNK operation can be performed by UNK manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us STOP 
START it seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one UNK act of burning each UNK citizens to UNK we must have a manned strategic force of UNK aircraft capable of going into china or russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us STOP 
START let us suppose the russians decide to build a UNK UNK force STOP 
START it is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the UNK or UNK in UNK operations against soviet UNK missiles STOP 
START if we stop thinking in terms of tremendous UNK nuclear weapons and consider UNK much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets it would seem that the UNK or UNK could carry a great many small nuclear weapons STOP 
START an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very UNK be given a mission to UNK all trains operating within a specified UNK area of russia provided that we had used some of our UNK to UNK russia's air defenses before our bombers got there STOP 
START the aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile UNK and UNK located targets as well as the known fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile STOP 
START why then aren't we planning a larger more important role for manned military aircraft there any other way to do the job of our strategic forces UNK mobile and hardened UNK hardened atlas and UNK and UNK UNK means that it will take some time perhaps weeks to destroy a strategic force STOP 
START war under these circumstances cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear UNK STOP 
START forces will survive a surprise attack and these forces will give depth or considerable duration to the conflict STOP 
START the forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed STOP 
START even mobile forces must be found and destroyed STOP 
START but how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces are not UNK to UNK destruction by ballistic missile STOP 
START some day many years in the future true UNK will be able to find and destroy mobile targets STOP 
START but until we have an effective UNK the answer to the UNK problem is manned aircraft STOP 
START however the aircraft which we have today are tied to large soft UNK STOP 
START nuclear rockets can destroy UNK with ease STOP 
START here then is our problem aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing the UNK on which the aircraft is completely dependent is UNK by the missile STOP 
START this makes today's aircraft a UNK or one mission weapon STOP 
START aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once STOP 
START this is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile STOP 
START but remember this it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets it is the UNK STOP 
START eliminate the UNK of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its UNK to long-range ballistic missiles STOP 
START there are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the UNK of aircraft on the ground put aircraft in UNK UNK when they are on the ground STOP 
START build long-range aircraft which can take off from small UNK UNK with UNK STOP 
START if we could use all the small UNK we have in this country we could UNK our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more STOP 
START use nuclear UNK to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life STOP 
START using very high UNK ratio engines develop a UNK UNK long-range military aircraft STOP 
START we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could UNK at least 200 aj STOP 
START we could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters STOP 
START large long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from UNK UNK but they would require more powerful engines than we have today STOP 
START there is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the UNK belief that the aircraft has been made UNK by the missile STOP 
START this same UNK with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our UNK effort to develop nuclear UNK for aircraft STOP 
START one seldom UNK the analogy nuclear UNK will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine STOP 
START if for some reason such as economy we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear UNK with a sense of national urgency then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a UNK ratio of 12 or 15 to one STOP 
START with UNK such as these vertical UNK and landing combat aircraft could be built STOP 
START for example a UNK engine would power a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START with a UNK engine a UNK aircraft UNK UNK pounds could rise UNK STOP 
START the reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high UNK engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are UNK STOP 
START when aircraft are no longer helpless on UNK they are no longer vulnerable to aj STOP 
START if our UNK bombers were today capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite UNK or long endurance had the capability to strike at russia again and again and again those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance STOP 
START we would have the means to seek out and destroy the UNK force whether it were fixed or mobile STOP 
START with such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be selective and extremely UNK STOP 
START no need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and UNK to UNK UNK the UNK military force STOP 
START our first necessity at the very outset of war is UNK UNK STOP 
START in a few years we will have UNK UNK missile observation system STOP 
START but in the case of moving targets and targets which have limited UNK what will their location be when it is time to destroy them targets have we successfully knocked out ballistic missile cannot today tell you if it was successful or UNK STOP 
START what targets still remain to be hit crucial questions must be answered by UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK will be hard put to see through clouds and to see in the dark STOP 
START even if this is some day possible there remains the UNK time of flight of a missile to its overseas target STOP 
START if the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way the probability of the missile destroying the target is UNK reduced STOP 
START UNK UNK is vital but only UNK UNK will allow us to terminate the war favorably STOP 
START it would be UNK to have an aircraft to gather that UNK UNK STOP 
START it could operate under the clouds and perform infrared UNK through clouds and at night STOP 
START it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the united states with the chance that the target if it were mobile would be gone STOP 
START a large aircraft such as the UNK or UNK could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons STOP 
START few people realize that one UNK of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 UNK UNK at 100 feet STOP 
START or put another way the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a UNK UNK 1 the size of those used in hiroshima and UNK within 100 to 200 feet of the target is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons STOP 
START today we have UNK radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings UNK UNK separate UNK of bridges etc. STOP 
START with these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas STOP 
START if we fail to develop the means to UNK down and destroy the UNK military force with extreme care and precision and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening STOP

START the UNK bridges over the UNK river in massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects STOP 
START for their length their types of construction their UNK UNK and their literary associations they should be known and remembered STOP 
START in this sequence i shall write about them in the order of their UNK STOP 
START the first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part and perhaps the most interesting one connected UNK now UNK with UNK point STOP 
START its building was first proposed in UNK when a group of citizens mostly UNK men UNK the general court for an act of UNK STOP 
START this document began no. 1 UNK port may UNK UNK whereas a bridge over UNK river from the land of UNK UNK UNK UNK in UNK to deer island and from said island to UNK would be of very extensive utility by UNK a safe UNK to UNK teams and UNK at all seasons of the year and at all times of tide STOP 
START we the UNK do agree that as soon as a convenient number of persons have UNK to this or a similar writing we will present a petition to the UNK general court of the UNK of massachusetts UNK for an act UNK into a body UNK the UNK to such writing with liberty to build such a bridge and a right to demand a toll equal to that received at UNK bridge and on like terms and if such an act shall be obtained then we UNK agree each with the others that we will hold in the said bridge the several shares set against our respective names the whole into two hundred shares being divided and that we will pay such sums of money at such times and in such manners as by the said proposed corporation shall be directed and required STOP 
START this paper was signed by UNK persons UNK a total of two hundred shares STOP 
START a month later the general court served notice to the town of UNK that the bridge was to be built STOP 
START the matter was considered and UNK and finally opposed but in spite of many objections the court granted a charter on january 9 UNK STOP 
START on november 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened STOP 
START timothy palmer who invented and later UNK the arch type of construction for wooden bridges was the genius who planned and UNK the building of the essex or deer island bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of william UNK who received UNK as UNK STOP 
START this UNK bridge is best described by rev. timothy dwight president of yale college in his UNK in UNK and UNK published in new haven in UNK STOP 
START he says of it it consists of two divisions separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore STOP 
START the division between the island and this shore consists UNK of an arch UNK is one hundred and sixty feet and whose UNK is forty feet it was actually UNK feet above the UNK mark STOP 
START in appearance and construction it UNK the UNK bridge STOP 
START the whole length of essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its UNK UNK STOP 
START i have already mentioned that mr. timothy palmer of UNK was the UNK of the arched bridges in this country STOP 
START as mr. palmer was educated to UNK only and had never seen a structure of this nature certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention STOP 
START it is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that timothy palmer was born in UNK in nearby UNK he moved with his parents to west UNK when he was sixteen years old was there UNK to a builder and architect UNK UNK STOP 
START it was indeed a remarkable UNK that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch which appears in his famous bridges at UNK UNK and philadelphia STOP 
START the essex UNK bridge when first built was not covered STOP 
START as far as we know no american bridge had been thus protected in UNK STOP 
START richard s. allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably UNK by UNK STOP 
START its original appearance is shown in an UNK published in the massachusetts magazine in may UNK which is UNK UNK fig. 1 STOP 
START a brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than UNK tons of timber STOP 
START between the UNK on the UNK shore and the south bank of deer island there was one span or arch measuring UNK feet the north shore of deer island and the UNK side there was an arch of UNK feet and a series of UNK with a draw forty feet long STOP 
START a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place july 4 UNK in a UNK erected by the corporation on the island STOP 
START it is said that the eccentric timothy UNK who was one of the first UNK stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion STOP 
START the essex journal says that he delivered an UNK on the bridge which for UNK of style UNK of speech or force of argument was truly UNK STOP 
START the reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek because UNK UNK could hardly be understood although he later explained that he was talking french it seems rather more likely that he had UNK to the UNK of the evening STOP 
START the north portion of the essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning STOP 
START it stood in its original form until UNK STOP 
START the southern half however on account of its UNK was considered by boat owners a UNK to UNK STOP 
START in UNK it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge STOP 
START this was built by john UNK from plans submitted by james UNK of UNK county pennsylvania STOP 
START timothy palmer had general supervision of the work STOP 
START an UNK in the UNK herald december 21 UNK shows palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges STOP 
START it reads chain bridges STOP 
START information is UNK given that mr. timothy palmer of UNK mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the UNK of the chain bridge in the states of massachusetts new hampshire vermont rhode island and connecticut so far as UNK to the sale of patent rights and the construction of chain bridges STOP 
START mr. palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site and lay out and UNK the work or recommend a suitable person to UNK it STOP 
START john UNK approved timothy palmer STOP 
START this chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the UNK end STOP 
START it fell february 6 UNK carrying with it a horse and wagon two men and four UNK STOP 
START the horse and men were saved but the UNK UNK STOP 
START in spite of this catastrophe the bridge was UNK on the same plan and opened again on july 17 UNK STOP 
START this second chain bridge was UNK feet long had two UNK UNK and a draw and a double UNK STOP 
START the essex bridge was a toll crossing until UNK when the county commissioners laid out all the UNK bridges as highways STOP 
START sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use the old covered wooden bridge that UNK the UNK valley river at UNK will have a distinctive part in the UNK UNK of the first land battle of the civil war at its home site may UNK to june UNK STOP 
START colonel frederick w. UNK UNK will again make his UNK ride down the steep UNK of UNK now college hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel benjamin f. UNK west virginia infantry then UNK through the streets in pursuit of the UNK UNK STOP 
START he was closely followed by the ohio and indiana troops thus the old bridge has another distinction of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the UNK STOP 
START the bridge has survived the natural UNK of the elements war fire and UNK as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic for more than a hundred years STOP 
START twice during the civil war it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the UNK and prayers of a local minister STOP 
START it still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on u.s. route 250 the old beverly and UNK turnpike STOP 
START it is one of the very few if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the u.s. highway system thus it is far more than a UNK of the horse and UNK days STOP 
START this covered wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of june 3 UNK and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the UNK area that it has become a part and UNK of the war story STOP 
START so frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it UNK with the old john brown fort at UNK ferry as the two UNK best known structures in west virginia STOP 
START completed and opened for traffic in UNK the bridge was designed and built by UNK UNK and his brother UNK of beverly STOP 
START the UNK brothers were experienced bridge builders and against the competition of other and better known bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered wooden bridges on the UNK and UNK turnpike a dozen years before as well as many other bridges for several counties STOP 
START the UNK bridge however was the UNK master piece with its UNK UNK lane span and it stands today as a monument to its builders STOP 
START never UNK the bridge was UNK in UNK by two extra UNK a concrete floor and a UNK along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic STOP 
START during the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains UNK supplies from the UNK at UNK to the troops operating in the interior STOP 
START union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other UNK weather and some of them left UNK of their stay by UNK their names and small UNK on its walls and beams STOP 
START but what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when UNK general william e. UNK jones reached UNK while on the famous UNK UNK in may UNK STOP 
START general jones was fresh from a long series of bridge UNK including the long bridge at UNK and after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge he sent his men to work UNK UNK in and around it STOP 
START reverend UNK UNK a baptist minister gathered a few citizens of southern UNK to call on jones and UNK with him to spare the structure UNK and argued pointing out that jones or other confederate UNK would need it should troops pass that way in retreat STOP 
START jones UNK he did not order his men to apply the UNK the drove of livestock was driven up the valley via beverly and across the mountains to feed and serve the confederate army while jones and his UNK turned toward UNK to join forces with UNK STOP 
START again reverend UNK saved the bridge when union soldiers planned to destroy it after filling its two UNK with hay and straw but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered certainly not because of pressure from an opposing confederate force STOP 
START on the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to UNK the soldiers from their purpose STOP 
START UNK around this historic old structure a group of UNK UNK county citizens have organized and planned a UNK series of events beginning on may UNK and continuing through june UNK to observe most UNK the UNK of the first land engagement of the civil war at UNK STOP

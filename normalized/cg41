START if she were not at home mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there STOP 
START sometimes mrs. coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor and play the piano she had brought to the white house STOP 
START mama knew she was playing her UNK favorite pieces and feeling close to him and did not UNK her STOP 
START all the rest of the days in the white house would be UNK by the tragic loss even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry UNK and to UNK the people around him STOP 
START a little boy came to give the president his personal UNK and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in STOP 
START UNK the maids cried a little over that and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs. coolidge STOP 
START the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy STOP 
START he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to UNK a smile to her lips STOP 
START he brought her UNK STOP 
START UNK were short in the days of mrs. coolidge and spanish UNK were thrown over them STOP 
START he got her dozens of them STOP 
START one UNK was so tremendous that she could not wear it so she UNK it over the UNK on the second floor and it hung over the UNK STOP 
START the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile STOP 
START mrs. coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her UNK collection STOP 
START she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed STOP 
START at night when mama would turn back the covers she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night STOP 
START mama always felt that the collection symbolized mrs. UNK wish for a little girl STOP 
START among the dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady who would pick it up and look at it often STOP 
START it had a tiny envelope tied to its UNK STOP 
START an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for mrs. UNK first UNK STOP 
START mama knew this UNK was meant to help mrs. coolidge overcome her UNK by turning her eyes to the future STOP 
START the name inside the envelope was UNK STOP 
START the UNK life after the death of their son was UNK than ever STOP 
START john was away at school most of the time STOP 
START mrs. coolidge would UNK and the president would sit reading or playing with the many UNK around them STOP 
START now and then the president would call for little jack master of the UNK which was his UNK for a UNK who had worked in the white house since UNK UNK administration and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals STOP 
START it was part of little jack's work to look after the dogs STOP 
START one white house dog was UNK in a painting STOP 
START that was rob roy who UNK with mrs. coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler UNK STOP 
START to get him to pose mrs. coolidge would feed him candy so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did STOP 
START i would like to UNK out a UNK about the dress mrs. coolidge is wearing in this painting STOP 
START it is not the same dress as the one on her UNK in the UNK STOP 
START people think the dress in the picture was UNK by an artist much later on STOP 
START this is not true STOP 
START the dress in the painting is a bright red with UNK forming a spray on the right side STOP 
START there is a long train flowing from the shoulders STOP 
START mrs. coolidge gave mama this dress for me and i wore it many times STOP 
START i still have the dress and i hope to give it to the UNK institution as a UNK or as i more UNK hope to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the presidents if i can get it organized STOP 
START but to get back to the coolidge household mrs. coolidge so obviously loved dogs that the public sent her more dogs UNK jane UNK and UNK STOP 
START the last two were a red and a black UNK STOP 
START rob roy remained boss of all the dogs STOP 
START he showed them what to do and taught them how to keep the maids around the white house in a state of terror STOP 
START the dogs would run through the UNK after him like a burst of bullets and all the maids would run for cover STOP 
START mama didn't know what to do whether to tell on rob roy or not since she had the ear of mrs. coolidge more than the other maids STOP 
START but she was afraid the first lady would not understand because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first family STOP 
START every day when the president took his UNK rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near him like a perfect gentleman and stare thoughtfully out the window or he would take a little UNK himself STOP 
START he would not make a sound until the president had UNK and left for the office he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear STOP 
START his signal was for the other dogs to come running but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out STOP 
START rob roy was UNK to UNK the president to his office every morning STOP 
START rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission and he would walk in front of the president looking neither to the right nor to the left STOP 
START at dinner lunch or breakfast the president would call out supper he called all meals supper after the UNK had announced the meal STOP 
START all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dining room STOP 
START they would all lie around on the rug during the meal a very pretty sight as rob roy UNK and UNK jane were all UNK STOP 
START when UNK and UNK were too young to be trusted in the dining room they were tied to the UNK with their UNK and they would cry STOP 
START mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she UNK up the sitting room before the first family returned STOP 
START finally mama did mention to mrs. coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs and then mrs. coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone even though her husband UNK of the waste of electricity STOP 
START mama was now the first maid to mrs. coolidge because UNK the previous first maid had become ill and died STOP 
START mrs. coolidge chose mama in her place STOP 
START it was a high mark for mama STOP 
START every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it UNK for true friendship STOP 
START for the UNK it was mr. and mrs. frank w. UNK of boston massachusetts owners of a large department store STOP 
START they seemed to be at the white house half the time STOP 
START the UNK were UNK because when the UNK were there the president would say grace at breakfast STOP 
START if the UNK were not there grace would be omitted STOP 
START speaking of breakfast the president UNK a new custom that of conducting business at the breakfast table STOP 
START the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part STOP 
START a new bill had been passed under UNK that designated the government rather than the president as the UNK for official meals STOP 
START so the president would make a UNK breakfast official by UNK government officials to attend STOP 
START he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the UNK come in and trim his hair while he ate STOP 
START mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful mr. coolidge certainly made a good president STOP 
START he knew exactly how to be colorful favorite guest of the house as far as the staff was concerned was mr. UNK the chewing gum king STOP 
START the white house had chewing gum until it could UNK no more and every christmas mr. UNK sent the president a check for $100 to be divided among all the help STOP 
START you can imagine that he got pretty good service STOP 
START another good friend of the UNK was george b. harvey who was the ambassador to great britain from UNK to UNK STOP 
START he had been a friend of the UNK and continued to be invited by the UNK STOP 
START the first UNK whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen UNK of UNK who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 UNK STOP 
START she was not an overnight guest in the white house but mr. UNK UNK the chief UNK had mama check her fur coat when she came in and take care of her needs STOP 
START mama said she was one of the UNK ladies she had ever seen STOP 
START mama was very UNK and one of the duties she was UNK of was UNK the edges of the flag that flew above the white house STOP 
START actually two UNK were used at the UNK a small one on UNK days and a big one on bright days STOP 
START the UNK would become UNK around the edges from blowing in the wind and mama would UNK it STOP 
START she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening STOP 
START she used to tell me when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way i have the wonderful safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind UNK STOP 
START even when mrs. coolidge was in UNK for her son she reached out to help other people in trouble STOP 
START one person she helped was my brother STOP 
START mama had told her how UNK lungs had been affected when he was UNK in the war STOP 
START he was in and out of mount UNK hospital for veterans any number of times STOP 
START taking a personal interest she had the doctor assigned to the white house dr. james UNK look UNK over STOP 
START as a result he was sent to a hospital in UNK until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service STOP 
START but again there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the UNK washington weather and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work STOP 
START when mrs. coolidge was in UNK she did not wear black STOP 
START she wore grey every day and white every evening STOP 
START mama knew that she was out of UNK when she finally wore bright colors STOP 
START the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored UNK to get her started STOP 
START she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face STOP 
START on the social side the UNK mama had at the formal UNK at the white house UNK her the most STOP 
START it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs and just as the first lady stepped off the last UNK mama would UNK out her long train before she UNK to the blue room to UNK her guests with the president STOP 
START mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night STOP 
START one night mama came home practically in a state of shock STOP 
START she had stood at the bottom of the stairs as usual when mrs. coolidge came down in the same dress that is now in the UNK to UNK her guests STOP 
START mama UNK down to fix the train but there was no train there reached and reached around the dress but there was nothing there STOP 
START she looked up and saw that without knowing it mrs. coolidge was holding it UNK STOP 
START mrs. coolidge looked down saw UNK UNK expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor STOP 
START mama UNK the train in place and not a step was lost STOP 
START the UNK did not always live at the white house during the presidency STOP

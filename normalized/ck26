START but they all said no your time will come STOP 
START enjoy being a bride while you can STOP 
START there was no room for company in the tiny UNK house where the UNK boys always took their UNK till they could get a house and a farm of their own STOP 
START so when the big house filled up and ran over the UNK found beds for everyone in their own homes STOP 
START and there was still not anything that linda kay could do STOP 
START so linda kay gave up asking and accepted her UNK STOP 
START without saying so she was really grateful to attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as bobby UNK wife STOP 
START she had made UNK for all the windows of her little house and she had kept it UNK and neat UNK as it was and UNK good meals for bobby joe STOP 
START she had done all the things she had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this STOP 
START people died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway at night STOP 
START bobby joe was gone all day now not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper STOP 
START when they first married he had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal STOP 
START now there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it UNK and she did not know where he went STOP 
START not that she complained or had any cause to STOP 
START four or five of the UNK from east texas were about his age so naturally they ran around together STOP 
START there was no reason for her to ask what they did STOP 
START thus a new pattern of days began to develop for UNK UNK did not die STOP 
START she lay still on the bed her head hardly UNK the UNK she opened her eyes and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup STOP 
START they stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next day or two STOP 
START those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home for she might die any time they might as well UNK their UNK for she might UNK on STOP 
START so the pattern was established STOP 
START when linda kay had put up her breakfast dishes and UNK her UNK UNK she would go to the big house STOP 
START there was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was or would be STOP 
START bobby joe and the boys would come by say UNK UNK sit on the porch a while STOP 
START the older men would be there at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town STOP 
START the women and children stayed at the UNK STOP 
START the women keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded like chickens shut up in a UNK for the night STOP 
START the children had to play away from the house in the barn UNK or the pasture behind the barn to maintain a proper UNK STOP 
START off and on all day someone would be UNK at the UNK gray dust that settled over everything STOP 
START the UNK cooler had been moved to UNK room and her door was kept shut that the rest of the house stayed open though there was a question as to whether it was UNK or cooler that way STOP 
START the dust UNK their UNK and the heat UNK them so that the women were always making ice water STOP 
START they had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy UNK blocks of ice in town as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there STOP 
START one afternoon as the women sat UNK softly a new UNK of people pulled up at the gate STOP 
START it was a UNK black UNK with the dust of the road its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and UNK STOP 
START they were an old fat couple as linda kay described them to herself a thick UNK man and a girl about ten or twelve STOP 
START there was much UNK much UNK STOP 
START cousin ada john cousin UNK cousin howard and how is she about the same john about the same STOP 
START all the women got up and offered their chairs and when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and their explanations STOP 
START we were on our vacation in canada howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to UNK and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home STOP 
START we came on as soon as we could STOP 
START there was the suggestion of ice water and in spite of the protest we're not really UNK linda kay to escape the UNK air and the UNK soft voices hurried to the kitchen STOP 
START she filled a big pitcher and set it with glasses on a tray STOP 
START carrying it to the living room she imagined the picture she made tall and UNK slim a bit sophisticated in her yellow UNK with a UNK UNK walk that she had learned as a UNK with the school band STOP 
START almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling UNK at such a time in such a place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling UNK as she entered the room STOP 
START howard the thick UNK man was looking at her STOP 
START she felt the look and looked back because she could not help it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed STOP 
START and who is this asked when she passed him a glass STOP 
START oh that's linda kay mama UNK said UNK STOP 
START she married our baby boy bobby joe this summer STOP 
START let's see cousin ada said STOP 
START he's a right smart younger than the rest oh yes mama laughed STOP 
START he's ten years younger than UNK STOP 
START we didn't expect him to come along for the UNK he was a tumor STOP 
START this joke was not funny to linda kay and she UNK as she always did hearing the muffled UNK of UNK laughter UNK UNK STOP 
START who is howard anyway asked bobby joe that night STOP 
START he makes me uncomfortable STOP 
START oh he's a second cousin or something STOP 
START he got in the oil business out at UNK and UNK into some money STOP 
START how old is he UNK i don't know STOP 
START thirty-five i guess STOP 
START he's been married and got this UNK kid STOP 
START if he UNK you don't pay him any mind STOP 
START he's just a big UNK STOP 
START bobby joe was thinking about something else STOP 
START say did you know they're fixing to have a UNK UNK season on the double UNK was talking about UNK again when they woke up STOP 
START listen i never had a chance to kill an UNK STOP 
START there never was a season before but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the UNK STOP 
START did he ever visit here when he was a kid kay asked STOP 
START who howard STOP 
START hell i don't know STOP 
START when he was a kid i wasn't around STOP 
START bobby joe took a gun from behind the door and with a quick UNK now was gone for the day STOP 
START almost immediately howard and his daughter UNK drove up in the UNK STOP 
START we're going after ice howard said and thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company STOP 
START there was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never UNK in a UNK STOP 
START driving along the UNK road to town howard talked STOP 
START finally he said tell me about yourself and linda kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life STOP 
START she was such a UNK UNK having been a UNK future farmers UNK and secretary of future UNK STOP 
START in her UNK year she had started going steady with bobby joe who was a football player future UNK UNK and president of future farmers STOP 
START it was easy to see that they were made for each other and they knew what they wanted STOP 
START bobby joe would be a senior this year and he planned to graduate STOP 
START but there was no need for linda kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home for bobby joe and UNK raise his children STOP 
START howard sighed STOP 
START you lucky kids he said STOP 
START i'd give anything if i could have found a girl like you STOP 
START then he told linda kay about himself STOP 
START of course he couldn't say much really because of UNK but linda kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got STOP 
START it made her feel different about howard STOP 
START she was going to tell bobby joe about how mistaken she had been but he brought one of the UNK home for supper and all they did was talk about UNK STOP 
START bobby joe was trying to get linda kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home STOP 
START cook a whole UNK exclaimed STOP 
START why i couldn't even cook a piece of UNK UNK never even saw any STOP 
START oh you could STOP 
START i want to UNK the whole thing and have it for the boys STOP 
START linda kay told him he couldn't do anything like that with his grandma dying and he said well they had to eat didn't they they weren't all dying STOP 
START linda kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry they were going up to the big house after supper and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little STOP 
START every night they all went to mama and papa UNK and sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze STOP 
START it was UNK or a little past and nearly light as day STOP 
START they all sat around and drank ice water and the men UNK and everybody had a good time STOP 
START once in a while they said what a shame it was with UNK dying but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other way STOP 
START that night the older men got to talking about going UNK on a moonlight night STOP 
START bobby joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been UNK and uncle bill UNK from mama UNK side of the family said he would just get up from there and take them right then STOP 
START after they had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places to sit STOP 
START there were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall STOP 
START howard who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air and took the spot on the edge of the porch where bobby joe had been sitting STOP 
START you'll be a UNK sight more comfortable there howard UNK said laughing and they all laughed STOP 
START linda kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable STOP 
START bobby joe had been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand from time to time but it seemed at once that howard sat much closer STOP 
START perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers she had never been so aware of UNK flesh before STOP 
START still she was not sorry he sat by her but in fact was UNK STOP 
START he had become the center of the company such stories he had to tell STOP 
START he had sold oil stock to bob hope and UNK UNK in person had helped fight an UNK fire that UNK six days and nights STOP

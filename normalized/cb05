START help when needed if the dominican republic UNK free democratic government it will be due in large part to the u.s. show of force that enabled president UNK to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship STOP 
START UNK UNK trujillo is calm STOP 
START none of the trujillo family remains STOP 
START mr. UNK is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring STOP 
START had u.s. UNK not appeared off the dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would now be UNK by civil war STOP 
START ultimately either the UNK would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a UNK by dominican elements UNK to castro in cuba STOP 
START within the organization of american states there may be some criticism of this UNK american intervention which was not without risk obviously STOP 
START but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined UNK UNK UNK shouting UNK yankees the u.s. action was UNK by a principal opposition leader dr. UNK UNK as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future STOP 
START mr. UNK troubles are by no means over STOP 
START he will need the help of all UNK members to UNK finally the forces of UNK UNK and UNK alike STOP 
START in UNK toward that objective UNK might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states STOP 
START matter of survival those watching the growing UNK between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in UNK STOP 
START now as then it is a matter of jobs STOP 
START craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance STOP 
START the issue was sufficiently UNK in UNK to spark UNK from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members STOP 
START that UNK was UNK 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations STOP 
START or that's what it looked like at the time STOP 
START but UNK and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs STOP 
START walter UNK leader of the industrial union UNK of the UNK says another two years of this UNK will be disastrous for all american labor STOP 
START whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as say UNK UNK of the UNK is a matter of UNK STOP 
START but the UNK UNK that result from the UNK UNK do not win friends for labor STOP 
START engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with UNK family UNK STOP 
START the concept of labor as a special class is UNK and in the task UNK america as UNK of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive STOP 
START UNK the army navy and air force among others may question secretary UNK claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the strongest UNK to the spread of communism STOP 
START but the secretary UNK that the success of the american farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world STOP 
START mr. freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more UNK by america's capacity to produce food UNK than by our industrial production or even by the UNK successes in space STOP 
START this shouldn't surprise the secretary taxpayers have been impressed by the UNK for a long long time STOP 
START in fact over the years the american UNK capacity to UNK has cost the taxpayers a large dollar STOP 
START and thus far mr. freeman has offered very little relief STOP 
START the 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored has been declared a billion dollar UNK STOP 
START in exchange for higher price supports UNK UNK reduction in planted acreage STOP 
START but the farmers UNK washington by UNK the distance between the rows and UNK on the UNK STOP 
START the result UNK billion added to the deficit in the federal budget STOP 
START perhaps as mr. freeman says american agriculture may stop the communists but it is also UNK the american taxpayer STOP 
START what's wrong at state a senate UNK headed by sen. jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some UNK conclusions STOP 
START the department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people sen. jackson says STOP 
START the UNK is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department STOP 
START president kennedy has indicated his UNK with its performance STOP 
START but those who would UNK so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of UNK of officials UNK to traditional procedures suspicious of UNK and fearful of mistakes STOP 
START nor does sen. jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy STOP 
START this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary UNK to UNK vigor and initiative among his UNK STOP 
START but competent observers believe he is making progress particularly toward what sen. jackson lists as the primary need a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them STOP 
START the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr. UNK will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged as sen. jackson puts it in work that does not really need doing STOP 
START mr. UNK should also draw comfort from sen. UNK recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved STOP 
START UNK is a rare but needed UNK in congress STOP 
START UNK men UNK economic activity is a UNK UNK even for the specialist STOP 
START but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a UNK of unemployment trends STOP 
START james p. mitchell when he was the head of the department promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago STOP 
START he lost but settled for a cake in the shape of a UNK STOP 
START his successor secretary UNK also has been UNK wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months STOP 
START no UNK man mr. UNK says he's merely putting my neck out again by UNK the rate will go down this month STOP 
START he is UNK his guess on new government statistics that show business has UNK its stride a new record high in personal income an increase in housing starts a UNK in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods STOP 
START mr. mitchell had an excuse for losing the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated STOP 
START mr. UNK has less reason for missing STOP 
START the economy seems to be sailing along on an even UNK and the 1961 UNK season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be UNK in november STOP 
START the odds thus appear favorable that the UNK neck may be UNK STOP 
START little resistance UNK chief of state who has been accused of UNK communist UNK and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and UNK UNK he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia STOP 
START but so convinced of UNK inevitable triumph is prince UNK that he is ready to throw in the UNK STOP 
START i have to see the facts is the way the prince puts it STOP 
START and from that point of UNK he UNK another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-western posture STOP 
START prince UNK powers of UNK some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions STOP 
START bottom UNK commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of UNK for official UNK economic UNK STOP 
START weeks ago he saw a business UNK in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement STOP 
START recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary UNK fell into line with mr. UNK UNK though there has been some UNK to do so at the white house STOP 
START and now mr. hodges has UNK further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point STOP 
START he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the UNK STOP 
START the secretary based his assessment on the UNK in retail sales STOP 
START UNK volume was 1 per cent above UNK for the first pickup since last october although it's still 1.5 per cent off from february 1960 STOP 
START UNK mr. UNK figures was the federal reserve UNK report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending march 4 STOP 
START in UNK for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the UNK level STOP 
START of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960 STOP 
START another optimistic sign this one from the labor department was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb. 25 STOP 
START initial claims for UNK benefits were said to have dropped by UNK in the week ending march 4 STOP 
START mr. hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes STOP 
START well we can't have everything STOP 
START prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut STOP 
START in new jersey too new jersey folk need not be told of the UNK march to the sea for in a single generation he has UNK and populated miles of our UNK and UNK on to develop the few open spaces that remain STOP 
START now the stone harbor bird UNK 31 acres of magic attraction for UNK UNK is threatened but the UNK extends far beyond our state STOP 
START against the dramatic fight being UNK for preservation of 30 miles of cape UNK UNK the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem UNK STOP 
START but interior secretary UNK UNK that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open UNK and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves STOP 
START the move for establishment of a national UNK park on UNK acres of cape UNK from UNK to UNK is UNK by president kennedy's interest in that area STOP 
START but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country STOP 
START by comparison stone harbor bird UNK allies seem less formidable for aside from the UNK society they are mostly the UNK common and cattle UNK and the louisiana green little blue and UNK UNK who nest and feed there STOP 
START but there is hope for conservation commissioner UNK has UNK the UNK as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space STOP 
START the UNK of UNK such places as the cape UNK and stone harbor UNK becomes more apparent every year STOP 
START public sentiment for UNK our rich natural heritage is growing STOP 
START but that heritage is UNK even faster STOP 
START no UNK much of the UNK president kennedy's peace corps may have held for some prospective UNK has been removed by UNK UNK the head UNK STOP 
START anybody who is expecting a UNK should according to mr. UNK get off the train right now STOP 
START first of all the UNK will have to UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START it will be a UNK training day STOP 
START then off to a remote place in an UNK country where the diet culture language and living conditions will be different STOP 
START and the pay of course will be UNK STOP 
START despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else STOP

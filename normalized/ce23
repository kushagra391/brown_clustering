START roy mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a UNK with the english UNK of the early nineteenth century especially the beautifully UNK art of john sell UNK STOP 
START and like this english master mason UNK his subjects in large UNK masses which though they seem UNK are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough UNK of the natural form that inspired them STOP 
START as a boy roy mason began the long process of UNK the goodness of the UNK its UNK of weather its change of seasons its variable UNK STOP 
START his father a professional UNK and an amateur landscape painter took his sons on numerous hunting UNK and UNK to them his knowledge and love of nature STOP 
START out of this background of hunting and fishing it was only natural that roy first painted subjects he knew best UNK in the field UNK in the stream UNK and UNK on the wing almost always against a vast UNK of weather landscape STOP 
START it is this subject matter that has brought mason a large and enthusiastic following among UNK but it is his exceptional performance with this UNK that UNK him to artists and UNK UNK STOP 
START mason had to earn the privilege of UNK himself exclusively to painting STOP 
START like many others he had to work hard long hours in a struggling family business which though it was allied to art of a kind the design and production of UNK UNK bore no relation to the painting of pictures STOP 
START but it did teach roy the basic techniques of commercial art and later for twelve years he and his sister UNK conducted an advertising art studio in philadelphia STOP 
START on the death of their father they returned to their home in UNK new york STOP 
START after more years of concentrated effort roy and his brother max finally established a UNK family business at the old stand STOP 
START during all this time roy continued to paint first only on UNK and then as the family business permitted for longer periods STOP 
START gradually he UNK from the shop altogether and for the past thirty years he has worked independently as a painter except for his continued hunting and fishing UNK STOP 
START but even on these the UNK often takes over while the UNK UNK off for a rich friendship with the painter UNK UNK who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had and this was limited to a few lessons though the two artists often went on painting trips together roy developed his art by himself STOP 
START in the best tradition he first taught himself to see then to draw with accuracy and assurance and then to paint STOP 
START he worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor and his first public recognition and early honors including his election to the academy were for his UNK in the heavier medium STOP 
START gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major if not exclusive technique STOP 
START it has been my privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasions mostly in the UNK of UNK STOP 
START more often than not i have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man UNK raw nature into a composed not UNK painting STOP 
START what i have observed time and time again is a process of integration integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on UNK form patterns that are made to UNK throughout the whole composition that over-all amazing control of large UNK which is the mason UNK STOP 
START finally come those little UNK of a UNK brush and the job is done STOP 
START UNK yes maybe no for the technical fact we have the UNK own testimony of late years i find that i like best to work UNK STOP 
START first i make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale approximately af inches in which i pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values the UNK light the middle tone and the UNK dark by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns STOP 
START if a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture i try to place them in the initial sketch STOP 
START for me these will belong more completely to their UNK if they are conceived in this early stage though i freely admit that i do not UNK to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose STOP 
START i am thoroughly convinced that most UNK suffer because the artist expects nature will do his UNK for him a result such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him STOP 
START just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting unless the position serves the design of the whole composition STOP 
START if the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design often only slightly UNK pictures would result STOP 
START out of long experience i have found that UNK figures and other objects like trees UNK and UNK can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position which i call UNK STOP 
START speed in painting a picture is valid only when it UNK UNK and UNK but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution he would do well to take these first sketches and UNK UNK their design to achieve a unified composition STOP 
START if i have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition i mean to project equal concern for color STOP 
START often in working UNK under all conditions of light and atmosphere a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright too dull or too light or too dark when viewed UNK in a UNK STOP 
START when this occurs i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor if i have been working on a full sheet in the field STOP 
START when working from one of my sketches i square it up and project its linear form UNK to the watercolor sheet with charcoal STOP 
START when this linear draft is completed i dust it down to a faint image STOP 
START from this point i paint in as direct a manner as possible by flowing on the UNK with as pure a color mixture as i can manage STOP 
START however first i thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines i have described STOP 
START then i plan my attack the parts i will finish first the range of values the UNK of minor details all in all mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of UNK STOP 
START the longer i work the more i am sure that for me at least a UNK method is important STOP 
START trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for UNK in the final painting STOP 
START as for materials i use the best available STOP 
START i work on a watercolor UNK in the field and frequently resort to a large garden UNK to protect my eyes from undue strain STOP 
START in my studio i work at a UNK table but leave the paper UNK so that i can move it freely to control the UNK STOP 
START i have used a variety of UNK UNK papers but prefer an english make rough surface in UNK weight STOP 
START after selecting a sheet and UNK it for UNK even the best sometimes has foreign UNK on its surface i UNK it thoroughly on both sides with clean cold water STOP 
START then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board STOP 
START in addition to the usual tools i make constant use of UNK tissue not only to UNK my UNK but to UNK up certain areas to UNK edges and to open up lights in dark UNK STOP 
START the great UNK of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a UNK makes it an ideal tool for the UNK STOP 
START i also use a small electric UNK to dry large UNK in the studio STOP 
START my UNK are different from those used by most UNK for i combine the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START the red UNK are 8 UNK 6 and 10 a very large flat wash brush STOP 
START the UNK are a UNK 2 and a UNK inch brush UNK to a sharp UNK edge STOP 
START my usual UNK consists of UNK colors UNK UNK orange raw UNK raw UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK blue UNK blue french UNK blue UNK green UNK green 2 UNK yellow pale yellow UNK UNK gray charcoal gray UNK gray and ivory black STOP 
START in UNK the UNK of roy mason the first thing that comes to mind is their essential UNK yet this word has such a varied UNK that it needs some UNK here STOP 
START true a mason watercolor is UNK a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory STOP 
START unlike many UNK patterns that present a static flat convention this UNK pictures are full of atmosphere and climate STOP 
START long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes a UNK in sharp focus either a light area with dark UNK or a dark one with lights middle distance often containing the major UNK a background usually a UNK form UNK against the sky STOP 
START in following this general principle mason provides the observer with a natural eye UNK from UNK to background and the illusion of depth is instantly created STOP 
START when painting UNK physical eyes are UNK while his UNK eye is wide open and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey STOP 
START he does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory his imagination his UNK STOP 
START it is for this reason that roy UNK selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment STOP 
START his pictures UNK though they are inspired by a particular UNK UNK in terms of weather skies earth and people STOP 
START by dealing with common landscape in an UNK way roy mason has found a particular UNK in american landscape art STOP 
START living with his UNK is a UNK experience of seeing nature UNK through the eyes of a sensitive UNK a breath and UNK of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all STOP 
START the artist was born in UNK mills new york in UNK and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to california he lived in western new york in UNK STOP 
START when i looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be march 15th i realized that roy was born under the right UNK sign for a UNK the water sign of UNK february 18 thru march 20 STOP 
START and how very often a water plane is UNK in his UNK and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again in his UNK month of march the years beginning in UNK mason has been awarded seventeen major UNK including two gold UNK UNK fund purchase awards joseph UNK memorial UNK american watercolor society UNK UNK purchase prize for watercolor art institute of chicago others in buffalo new york UNK new haven UNK UNK and most recently the UNK prize for a watercolor at the UNK beach art association he was elected to the national academy of design as an associate in the oil class in UNK after receiving his first UNK fund purchase prize at the academy in 1930 and elevated to UNK in 1940 STOP 
START other UNK include the american watercolor society philadelphia water color club allied artists of america UNK artists baltimore watercolor society STOP

START franklin d. lee proved a man of prompt action when mrs. claire UNK accompanied by a friend visited him in UNK california several months ago as a prospective patient STOP 
START doctor lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes STOP 
START then by UNK her foot three times he came up UNK with a different diagnosis with each squeeze STOP 
START she had he informed her UNK trouble liver trouble and a severe female UNK STOP 
START he explained that he could UNK these UNK from UNK her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it STOP 
START he knew just the thing for her a treatment from his cosmic light UNK generator machine STOP 
START as he applied the UNK extending from the machine which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes UNK on a UNK base to the supposedly UNK portions of mrs. UNK body lee kept up a steady stream of UNK UNK STOP 
START yes the UNK from his machine would cure practically everything he assured her STOP 
START did she know he asked why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health human body he pointed out for example required UNK units of blue light STOP 
START for that reason he informed her the lord made the sky blue STOP 
START continuing UNK in this vein he paused to comfort her don't you worry STOP 
START this machine will cure your UNK body STOP 
START cancer UNK practically UNK STOP 
START you didn't tell me i had cancer STOP 
START you have it all right STOP 
START but as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about STOP 
START why i once used this machine to cure a woman with UNK pounds of cancer in her body STOP 
START he urged her to buy one of his machines for UNK STOP 
START when she said that she didn't have the money he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one STOP 
START he then sold her minerals to cure her UNK UNK a can of UNK to make her look like a girl again and an application of plain mud to take her UNK away STOP 
START lee renewed his pressure on mrs. UNK to buy his machine when she visited him the next day STOP 
START after another treatment with the machine he told her that her entire body was shot through with UNK and UNK STOP 
START he then sold her some UNK that he asserted would take care of the UNK and UNK until she could collect the money for buying his machine STOP 
START when she submitted to his treatment with the UNK mrs. UNK felt intense pain STOP 
START leaving UNK office mrs. UNK hurried over to her family physician who treated her for burned tissue STOP 
START for several days she was ill as a result of UNK treatment STOP 
START mrs. UNK never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid lee some UNK for his UNK machines STOP 
START for mrs. UNK who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited lee and her friend were agents for the california pure food and drug inspection bureau STOP 
START and she felt UNK UNK for her suffering when the evidence of UNK UNK UNK gathered by the tape UNK under her UNK clothing proved adequate in court for UNK franklin d. lee STOP 
START the charge violation of the california medical practices act by practicing medicine without a license and selling UNK drugs STOP 
START the sentence UNK UNK UNK in the county jail STOP 
START an isolated case of UNK no means STOP 
START rather it is typical of the thousands of UNK who use phony therapeutic devices to UNK themselves on the UNK of hundreds of thousands of americans by UNK them of millions of dollars and UNK them away from legitimate ethical medical treatment of serious diseases STOP 
START the machine UNK makes his UNK UNK devices out of odds and ends of UNK wires and radio parts STOP 
START with these UNK impressive to the UNK because of their UNK light UNK UNK and UNK he then carries out a vicious medical UNK game UNK on people's respect for the electrical and atomic UNK of our scientific age STOP 
START he UNK the latest scientific advances UNK them into his own special buck UNK vocabulary to UNK his UNK machines as a UNK for everything from hay fever to sexual UNK and cancer STOP 
START the UNK UNK operates or sells his phony machines for UNK to UNK anything the traffic will bear STOP 
START he may call himself a UNK a UNK an UNK a UNK a UNK a medical UNK a UNK a doctor or what have you STOP 
START not only do these UNK assume impressive titles but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations foundations which often have little more than a UNK existence STOP 
START the medical device UNK of today of course is a far more sophisticated operator than his UNK of UNK the UNK UNK of snake oil and other patent UNK STOP 
START his UNK is therefore far higher running into hundreds of millions STOP 
START according to the food and drug administration UNK doctor UNK dr. albert UNK and his UNK and dr. UNK UNK to name three UNK device UNK succeeded respectively in UNK 10,000 UNK and UNK UNK health machines STOP 
START authorities believe that many of the doctor UNK using these false health UNK are still in business STOP 
START look at the sums paid by two device UNK victims in cleveland STOP 
START sarah gross a dress shop proprietor paid UNK to a UNK and mr. a. a UNK paid UNK to a UNK for treatment with two UNK health machines the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START UNK these figures by the millions of people known to be UNK by medical pirates annually STOP 
START you will come up with a frightening total STOP 
START that's why the UNK the american medical association UNK and the national better business bureau UNK have estimated the toll of mechanical UNK to be a substantial portion of the UNK million or so paid to medical UNK annually STOP 
START the UNK general recently reported that mail order UNK among which UNK therapeutic devices figure UNK are at the highest level in history STOP 
START similarly the american cancer society UNK the UNK and UNK foundation and the UNK have each stated lately that medical UNK is at a new high STOP 
START for example the UNK has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about UNK devices and 10 times as many UNK compared with two years ago STOP 
START authorities UNK to quote exact figures however believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface UNK turned up by their inevitably limited UNK of the real UNK of the medical UNK STOP 
START in this sense authorities believe that all estimates of phony device UNK are conservative STOP 
START the economic toll that the device UNK UNK is important of course STOP 
START but it is our health more precious than all the money in the world that these modern UNK doctors with their UNK therapeutic UNK are gambling away STOP 
START by UNK on the sick by playing UNK on the hopes of the desperate by causing the UNK to delay proper medical care these medical UNK create pain and misery by their very activity STOP 
START typically sarah gross and mr. a both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their cleveland UNK STOP 
START sarah gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous UNK by the UNK were not helping her STOP 
START as a result she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her UNK doctor was using were phony STOP 
START she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be UNK STOP 
START mr. a. her fellow UNK also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been UNK of his life savings by the limited UNK who had been treating his wife a woman suffering from an UNK disease multiple UNK and himself STOP 
START mr. a has UNK but he is UNK a bitter man STOP 
START that's a lot of UNK money to lose he says today STOP 
START neither me nor my wife were helped by that UNK treatments STOP 
START and there was the case of tom UNK a UNK who was referred by a friend to a health machine UNK who treated him with a so-called UNK machine for what doctor UNK said was a system full of UNK and UNK STOP 
START after his pains got worse tom decided to see a real doctor from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung STOP 
START yes tom caught it in time to stay alive STOP 
START but he's a welfare case now a human UNK thanks to this modern UNK doctor STOP 
START but the machine UNK can cause far more than just suffering STOP 
START in such diseases as cancer UNK and heart disease early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with doctor UNK UNK UNK can prove fatal STOP 
START moreover the UNK patient who UNK on cure by the UNK device and therefore cuts off his UNK UNK can be UNK suicide STOP 
START for instance in chicago some time ago mr. h. age 27 a UNK since he was six stopped using UNK because he had bought a magic UNK a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with UNK UNK worth a small fraction of a cent sold by the UNK company of chicago for UNK as a UNK STOP 
START hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your UNK and its UNK will cure any disease you have said the company STOP 
START mr. h. is dead today because he followed this advice STOP 
START UNK hull suffering from UNK was taken by her husband to see UNK g. carroll a UNK a UNK UNK UNK in UNK STOP 
START carroll UNK mrs. hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his UNK machine and UNK some UNK fee UNK STOP 
START his UNK hot and cold UNK to increase her absorption of water STOP 
START although she weighed only UNK pounds when she visited him carroll permitted her to go on a UNK fast in which she took nothing but water STOP 
START inevitably mrs. hull died of UNK and UNK UNK 60 pounds STOP 
START moreover her husband and child UNK UNK from her STOP 
START small wonder a UNK jury awarded the husband UNK for his wife's death STOP 
START in california a few years ago a UNK by the name of h. f. bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer STOP 
START he did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for UNK to UNK from survivors of patients who had died UNK them and selling them at UNK each STOP 
START when authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of UNK one of his victims was not around to UNK he was dead of cancer STOP 
START by no means are these isolated cases STOP 
START unfortunately says chief UNK inspector david h. UNK who has UNK many device UNK the UNK who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully UNK because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court STOP 
START death no doubt about it STOP 
START that's where device UNK can lead STOP 
START the evidence shows that UNK therapeutic machines substituted for valid medical UNK have UNK the UNK of thousands STOP 
START who are the victims of the device UNK say that UNK are a prime target STOP 
START says UNK f. UNK director of the UNK division of public information UNK are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people or to UNK from chronic UNK such as UNK UNK UNK and cancer STOP 
START people who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by UNK STOP 
START the victims of the UNK are frequently poor people like mr. a. who UNK up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to doctor UNK UNK STOP 
START they are often ignorant as well as UNK STOP

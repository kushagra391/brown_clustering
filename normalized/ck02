START where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves UNK themselves upward in angry motion UNK sat UNK his smooth UNK his very UNK UNK all the turmoil about him STOP 
START our objective the colonel had said that day of the UNK is UNK STOP 
START there the objective sat brooding over all STOP 
START UNK burn blast UNK it as they would could anyone really take UNK the UNK UNK and himself in the valley over which UNK UNK men had hidden high UNK UNK UNK and mines STOP 
START the UNK valley was a UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START on the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire STOP 
START at the UNK base UNK of UNK stretched out of eye range like a wild UNK of children's UNK stopped simultaneously UNK poised as if UNK the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling again STOP 
START closer still regular UNK of barbed wire hung on timber supports STOP 
START was it all UNK labor would clean up the mess when the war was over at his UNK thoughts warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down STOP 
START tonight a group of men tomorrow night he himself would go out there somewhere and wait STOP 
START if he were to go with white he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some point between here and UNK but moving ever deeper into enemy land behind UNK itself STOP 
START was this what he had expected hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think so many UNK STOP 
START somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told that combat was an UNK activity STOP 
START now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached STOP 
START it could take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now STOP 
START there was just too much time STOP 
START time to become afraid STOP 
START UNK suggestion UNK but he did not like the identity STOP 
START he did not UNK over with hatred for the enemy STOP 
START he hadn't even seen him yet pressing his cigarette out in the earth warren walked to the UNK and UNK the UNK hills STOP 
START he saw no life but still stood there for a time UNK at the UNK hills his gaze continually returning to UNK STOP 
START he had come here in order to test himself STOP 
START while most of his beliefs were still UNK he knew that he did not believe in killing STOP 
START yet he was here STOP 
START he had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a UNK STOP 
START there were ten men on the patrol which sergeant UNK led out that next night STOP 
START the UNK UNK was carrying a UNK machine gun man UNK the UNK and a box of ammunition STOP 
START warren and white each carried in addition to their own weapons and UNK a box of UNK for the UNK machine gun STOP 
START others carried extra UNK for the UNK automatic rifle which was in the hands of a little mexican named UNK STOP 
START UNK had UNK the two new men that afternoon STOP 
START we just sit quiet and wait UNK had said STOP 
START be sure the man nearest you is awake STOP 
START if joe doesn't show up we'll all be back here at UNK hours STOP 
START otherwise we hold a reception STOP 
START then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover but nobody UNK out until i say so STOP 
START remember what i said about going out to get anybody left behind still holds STOP 
START we bring back all dead and wounded STOP 
START at UNK hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure STOP 
START then began the journey through their own mine fields STOP 
START mines STOP 
START ours were UNK than theirs some said STOP 
START they set UNK UNK to jump and UNK at UNK level while we more UNK had them go off at the head STOP 
START mines STOP 
START big ones and little STOP 
START the crude wooden boxes of the enemy our UNK turned gray metal UNK STOP 
START but theirs UNK the UNK STOP 
START mines STOP 
START a foot UNK a leg missing STOP 
START mines STOP 
START all sizes big ones some wired to set off a whole field little ones hand UNK size STOP 
START UNK UNK to fill the head with UNK of metal STOP 
START warren tried to shake off the UNK of his fears by looking at the sky STOP 
START it was dark STOP 
START UNK had said that the UNK would be bounced off the clouds at UNK hours which gives us time to get settled in position STOP 
START because they were new men and to be sure that they didn't get lost UNK had placed warren and white in the center of the patrol as it filed out STOP 
START his eyes now fixed on UNK solid figure warren could hear behind him the UNK of another STOP 
START he could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position STOP 
START they were going to follow it for part of their journey STOP 
START it's safe UNK had said and it provides cover for our noise STOP 
START soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which UNK in the night STOP 
START on their right rose the UNK covered with brush and trees STOP 
START if a branch extended out too far each man held it back for the next and if they met a low UNK each warned the other STOP 
START thus UNK they advanced UNK they turned to the right climbed the UNK and walked into the valley again STOP 
START there was no cover here only grass UNK against UNK STOP 
START and with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert the grass stripped something from warren STOP 
START the gentle UNK of each UNK left him more naked than before until he felt his UNK flesh UNK UNK by each new sound STOP 
START the shapes of the men ahead of him lacked UNK as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh STOP 
START the dark forms moved like UNK on some UNK UNK their UNK UNK for want of vocal UNK STOP 
START the UNK broken trees in the valley assumed UNK shapes STOP 
START UNK of brush that they passed were so many UNK UNK UNK in anger to tear and UNK on his bones STOP 
START UNK over all UNK UNK down at him threatening a hundred hidden UNK STOP 
START off in the distance a UNK flashed on its beam UNK the sky STOP 
START the sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud then reflected to the earth in a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START somewhere over there another patrol had need of light STOP 
START warren thought of all the men out that night who like himself had left their protective ridge and fear working at their UNK picked their way into the area beyond STOP 
START from the east to the west coast of the korean UNK was a strip of land in which UNK men were at that same moment UNK UNK through the night sitting in UNK anticipation of any movement or sound or shouting UNK confused rifle UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK arm went up and warren raised his own STOP 
START the patrol was stopping STOP 
START UNK came up STOP 
START take that spot over there he whispered pointing to a small UNK of UNK STOP 
START give me your machine gun UNK STOP 
START warren handed him the metal box and UNK quietly disappeared down the line STOP 
START lying in the grass behind the brush UNK warren looked about STOP 
START the others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush STOP 
START over his shoulder he could see UNK with the machine gun crew STOP 
START even at this short distance they were only vague shapes setting up the machine gun on a small UNK so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol STOP 
START warren UNK his UNK safety off and gently slowly UNK another UNK of ammunition from one of the cloth UNK that marked the upper part of his body with an aj STOP 
START this he placed within quick reach STOP 
START the walk and his fears had served to UNK him and his UNK UNK cooled at the touch of the night air STOP 
START although the UNK UNK fitted the upper part of his body UNK he felt no security STOP 
START figures seemed to UNK in the surrounding dark the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched STOP 
START certain this UNK was only imaginary he yet stared in UNK horror his hand UNK against the stock of his weapon STOP 
START he was aware of UNK inner UNK as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body STOP 
START above the UNK ivory UNK of their UNK pointed at the clouds UNK the UNK dark to a UNK light STOP 
START then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees standing like the UNK of a medieval UNK scene STOP 
START even so he could not ease the tension of his body rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax STOP 
START UNK the UNK presence of the other men in the patrol he felt UNK united to these nine UNK sharing this UNK of being with him STOP 
START he sensed something precious in the UNK moment something UNK to the knowledge gained on his UNK trip through the french UNK a knowledge UNK in UNK STOP 
START in france he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone UNK men had thrown up to the sky and always as he UNK he felt a stranger to their UNK STOP 
START they were poems in a strange language of which he could barely touch a meaning enough to make his being UNK with the desire for the UNK he sensed there STOP 
START UNK that UNK mystery through which he traveled for thirty days sleeping in the UNK of farmers or alongside roads had worked some subtle change in him he knew and it was in UNK that he had met pierre STOP 
START pierre had no hands had been UNK at the UNK STOP 
START with leather cups fitted in his UNK he UNK his UNK STOP 
START he and warren had traveled together for four days STOP 
START they visited the UNK at UNK and pierre had to sign the register UNK for the UNK of the visiting UNK STOP 
START he took the pen in his UNK and began to write STOP 
START wait the guard who ran from the hut to UNK to other men standing about outside STOP 
START they crowded the small room and peered over one UNK shoulders to watch the UNK man write his name in the book STOP 
START UNK formidable they exclaimed STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START and then the questions came eager interested questions and many UNK on his having overcome his UNK STOP 
START doesn't it ever bother you warren had asked to have people always asking you about your hands oh the french are a very curious people pierre had laughed STOP 
START they are also honest UNK after truth STOP 
START now the english are painfully silent about my missing hands STOP 
START they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there STOP 
START the americans like yourself take the fact for granted try to be helpful but don't ask questions STOP 
START i'm used to all three but i think the french have the UNK attitude STOP 
START that was the day that pierre had told warren about the UNK of UNK STOP 
START you are looking tired and there you can rest STOP 
START it will be good for you STOP 
START i think too he said his dark eyes UNK that you will find there some clue to the secret of the UNK about which you have spoken STOP 
START within two weeks warren was UNK the bell at the UNK gate STOP 
START the monk who opened the door immediately UNK his worries about his reception i speak english the old man said but i do not hear it very well STOP 
START he smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs UNK on it into his ear as though that might help STOP 
START smiling at UNK UNK the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor STOP 
START will you please wait in here STOP

START if she sensed any unusual UNK on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it STOP 
START after they had finished eating UNK took UNK the UNK under her arm so that UNK grace can teach it about the UNK and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother STOP 
START she had offered to walk but pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally UNK her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called UNK STOP 
START when they reached their UNK house pamela said a few UNK words to grace and kissed UNK lightly on the forehead the impulse UNK by a stray thought of the type to which she was frequently subject these days that they might never see one another again STOP 
START then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill with the village as her UNK UNK STOP 
START as she drove she thought about her plan STOP 
START it was really quite simple STOP 
START so simple in fact that it might even work although pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to UNK too much assurance STOP 
START that mistake she thought had cost her UNK these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the UNK that the mountain might set for her STOP 
START she must be UNK so as not to alert the UNK forest STOP 
START when the station wagon drew UNK of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the UNK house pamela turned the wheel UNK the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped STOP 
START all of her movements were careful and UNK UNK of the UNK of a criminal who has UNK his UNK for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime STOP 
START she locked the UNK removed the keys stepped out of the car and went into the house STOP 
START here she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom STOP 
START on her bureau lay a small brass UNK of simple design and faded UNK an object which pamela believed now had been the property of her UNK major UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START he had belonged to this land and perhaps had UNK it and this was the only material symbol that remained of him STOP 
START if she pamela were being held responsible for his crimes then hers must be the final act of UNK STOP 
START she would return this symbol to the mountain as one UNK seed back into the soil every spring or as ancient UNK UNK demand annual human sacrifice STOP 
START slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the UNK into the pocket of her UNK moved down the stairs and out of the house STOP 
START there was only one place where the mountain might receive her that UNK UNK pool UNK in its secret UNK STOP 
START UNK if UNK were possible could only be made at that sacred UNK UNK STOP 
START it was there that she would have to UNK her UNK beg forgiveness STOP 
START perhaps it was insane pamela thought STOP 
START perhaps it was all a UNK conceived dream STOP 
START but she was caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were a dream it was one from which she might never UNK STOP 
START facing the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool STOP 
START she remembered little of her previous journey there with grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it STOP 
START the forest was open and freely UNK extending an UNK hand STOP 
START the ground was covered with soft pine UNK and the slope was gentle STOP 
START birds UNK and UNK in the trees and the sun all UNK and soft UNK her shoulders UNK from time to time STOP 
START it was not thought pamela such an evil place after all STOP 
START no wonder UNK responded so completely to its UNK STOP 
START perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed STOP 
START was it not possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her child that its sympathy lay with the UNK that she had UNK in failing to understand this felt calm and peaceful as she walked along STOP 
START the slight UNK that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the dim UNK of trees through which she occasionally passed did not UNK her fear STOP 
START she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the UNK she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her UNK UNK struggle with the mountain and its UNK inhabitants STOP 
START having UNK too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her pamela was relieved now to admit their UNK and to be taking definite steps toward UNK with them STOP 
START a few days ago she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous on the contrary it seemed utterly reasonable STOP 
START she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal STOP 
START if as she walked her steps UNK from time to time she chose to ignore that UNK STOP 
START if the slope grew UNK and the UNK more dim she tried not to UNK STOP 
START success UNK upon maintaining her UNK must be poised and proud and UNK in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest STOP 
START the forest took on an impersonal aspect STOP 
START it did not care what sort of person UNK its woods UNK at its bark or stripped the UNK from its UNK STOP 
START UNK indifferent UNK the forest was simply there fighting man's UNK with more UNK growth and man's UNK with its own musical evening laughter STOP 
START red man or white man UNK or killer the forest would accept them all knowing that it could UNK equally well on UNK and UNK that its UNK mass would always UNK the short span of time UNK to any man STOP 
START pamela shook her head STOP 
START she must not think about time STOP 
START that was another one of those UNK STOP 
START in her grim pursuit of UNK pamela focused her thoughts on her husband STOP 
START if when this was all over she found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever understand STOP 
START how could he UNK her need when he himself was innocent UNK would not UNK upon his nights nor would his days be UNK by the UNK UNK figure of her UNK UNK STOP 
START his bright daylight mind would UNK away such images would not dare to face his UNK STOP 
START pamela was glad jim was nowhere near STOP 
START his presence would have UNK with her duty STOP 
START the UNK grew UNK and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine UNK STOP 
START the trees UNK more closely together their UNK and leaves UNK in a UNK curtain against the sun STOP 
START UNK and UNK UNK the rocks in forming UNK UNK for the struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass pamela could no longer be positive of her direction STOP 
START nevertheless she continued to move upward STOP 
START she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of UNK STOP 
START the forest had become an alien world where she UNK alone UNK UNK to deal with whatever UNK were offered STOP 
START it was a bold dark UNK of pine UNK that stood like a medieval UNK UNK the sun and human time STOP 
START at one and the same time she was within it but still searching for the UNK that would give her entry STOP 
START silence came into the forest a solid being that UNK its hand over the UNK UNK of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees STOP 
START silence walked at UNK side its presence UNK close yet too far for her to hear STOP 
START silence stood in front of her waiting and in back of her UNK her retreat STOP 
START she stumbled over the root of a tree that UNK UNK above the earth STOP 
START in spite of her attempt to preserve her balance she fell UNK her arm on a naked stone STOP 
START for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath returning in short frightened UNK she lifted herself to her feet UNK STOP 
START she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes STOP 
START her arm UNK slightly and the UNK skin cried out in pain STOP 
START she looked around STOP 
START she was UNK STOP 
START she seemed to have come such a long distance too far for her UNK which had UNK been swallowed up in the UNK gloom of the trees STOP 
START she stood quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide her STOP 
START she was standing in a thick grove STOP 
START the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches UNK virtually UNK out the sun completely STOP 
START the earth smelled moist and UNK as it might in a UNK UNK of the UNK effect of the UNK UNK STOP 
START she had the feeling that under the UNK leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly UNK and giving their soil back to the mountain STOP 
START the thought made pamela UNK STOP 
START a terrible chill swept through the grove STOP 
START not a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a UNK familiarity upon the deep UNK of the grove UNK pamela in a UNK embrace STOP 
START there was a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived STOP 
START where before had she felt or UNK or imagined such a scene already knew this UNK UNK atmosphere that was somehow UNK alive STOP 
START it enclosed her UNK hands and UNK around her UNK STOP 
START it crept into the open neck of her UNK and slid down her body UNK into her flesh through all the UNK UNK of her skin STOP 
START it crawled across her UNK UNK the life in her UNK STOP 
START it UNK her UNK UNK with its icy UNK STOP 
START it entered her body with the UNK UNK of an UNK and its particles spreading UNK UNK joined themselves into steel bands that UNK her knees so tightly that they UNK her lungs so that her breath came in harsh UNK her throat and UNK up the UNK in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were UNK together in the rigid UNK of her UNK STOP 
START she had to get away from here before this UNK possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain UNK her of reason and sight STOP 
START but she did not know which way to go STOP 
START the shadows of the trees UNK her UNK every possible UNK from the grove STOP 
START she had been UNK here by a UNK UNK that UNK around her throat in UNK circles STOP 
START she could not scream for even if a sound could take shape within her UNK mouth who would hear who would listen the mountain listen UNK UNK STOP 
START she had to escape STOP 
START she had to move in some direction any direction that would take her away from this evil place STOP 
START she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that UNK her and tried to UNK her back STOP 
START her own body protested UNK painfully where the blood in her UNK had UNK where cold UNK UNK still clung and UNK STOP 
START every movement she made seemed UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK cracked loudly under her feet UNK and UNK at her UNK branches snapped as she pushed them UNK away from her STOP

START origin of state automobile practices STOP 
START -hlthe practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years STOP 
START at least one state vehicle was in existence in UNK STOP 
START the state presently owns UNK passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 STOP 
START the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for UNK maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time STOP 
START the motor pool has made exceptional progress in UNK management including establishment of cost UNK systems records keeping analyses of vehicle use and UNK UNK in vehicle operation STOP 
START cars were operated in 1959 for an average UNK per mile STOP 
START purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases STOP 
START unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal UNK taxes STOP 
START vehicle purchase assignment and use policies STOP 
START -hlthe UNK role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to UNK funds for vehicles STOP 
START the meaningful policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state's administrative officers STOP 
START meaningful policies include a kinds of cars the state should own b when cars should be UNK c the need and assignment of vehicles d use of cars in UNK of mileage allowances e employees taking cars home and f need for UNK insurance on state automobiles STOP 
START a review of these policies indicates 1 the state purchases and UNK grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle STOP 
START 2 the purchase of compact economy cars is being made currently on a test basis STOP 
START 3 cars are UNK mostly on a UNK basis in the interest of economy STOP 
START 4 the factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances STOP 
START 5 UNK efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles STOP 
START 6 it is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes STOP 
START 7 the state has recently undertaken UNK insurance for drivers of state cars STOP 
START automobile practices in other states STOP 
START -hla survey of practices and policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with rhode UNK practices STOP 
START UNK states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business STOP 
START two other states provide vehicles but only with legislative approval STOP 
START states which provide automobiles for employees assign them UNK to the agency the individual or to a central pool STOP 
START UNK states operate a central motor pool for acquisition allocation and maintenance of state-owned vehicles STOP 
START nineteen states report laws policies or regulations for UNK state vehicles in UNK of paying mileage allowances STOP 
START of these states the average UNK point at which a car is substituted for allowances is UNK miles per year STOP 
START mileage allowances STOP 
START UNK allowances for state employees are of two types a actual mileage and b fixed monthly allowances STOP 
START actual mileage allowances are UNK UNK allowed employees for the use of UNK vehicles on state business at the rate of UNK per mile STOP 
START fixed monthly allowances are UNK for the same purpose except on a UNK basis STOP 
START both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's travel regulations STOP 
START rhode UNK UNK rate of UNK per mile for use of UNK cars UNK favorably with other UNK rates STOP 
START the average of UNK rates is UNK per mile STOP 
START rhode UNK rate of UNK per mile is considerably lower than UNK rates in the federal government and in industry UNK which approximate a UNK per mile average STOP 
START actual mileage allowances are UNK and not UNK expensive for the state STOP 
START the travel regulations requirements and procedures governing UNK are controlled properly and not UNK UNK STOP 
START fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject STOP 
START they have a great advantage in ease of UNK time and payment STOP 
START however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures STOP 
START flat payments over UNK per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles STOP 
START travel allowances STOP 
START UNK allowances including UNK have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other UNK allowances STOP 
START with few exceptions UNK on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and UNK per day UNK STOP 
START travel allowances are UNK and pose little problem in administration and UNK control STOP 
START origin of state automobile practices general background STOP 
START -hlit is difficult to UNK the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in rhode island STOP 
START few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 STOP 
START those that are available shed little light STOP 
START the UNK of motor vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as UNK STOP 
START it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old STOP 
START the best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the UNK of expanded highway construction during the UNK and UNK STOP 
START at that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties STOP 
START using UNK vehicles was a personal UNK for such employees and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly UNK STOP 
START once the principle was established the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly STOP 
START and reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth STOP 
START table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees STOP 
START this rate of increase does not UNK anything in itself STOP 
START it does not indicate loose management UNK controls or poor policy STOP 
START but it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees STOP 
START in the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now STOP 
START whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is UNK STOP 
START the fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them STOP 
START history and operation of the motor pool STOP 
START UNK the origin of state-owned automobiles may be UNK subsequent developments concerning the assignment use and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly STOP 
START prior to 1942 automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned STOP 
START this responsibility included all phases of management STOP 
START it UNK determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles who was to drive when and where UNK were to be made where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters STOP 
START in 1942 however the nation was at war STOP 
START gasoline and automobile tires were UNK commodities STOP 
START the state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual STOP 
START it met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more UNK called the motor pool a UNK operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation STOP 
START the motor pool then as now had UNK facilities in providence and other UNK located throughout the state STOP 
START it was UNK the responsibility of the department of public works and was financed on a UNK fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the UNK operation STOP 
START in 1951 the UNK operation was transferred to the UNK department of administration an agency established as the central staff and UNK department of the state government STOP 
START the management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made STOP 
START the agencies of government are now UNK for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars STOP 
START whereas the maintenance UNK fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations the introduction of the UNK system plus other control UNK has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis STOP 
START one indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period UNK while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased UNK the total maintenance cost increased only UNK STOP 
START in order to further UNK the management of passenger vehicles on july 1 1958 the actual title to every vehicle was transferred by executive order to the division of methods research and office services STOP 
START the objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicles STOP 
START note so far as state police cars are concerned only their replacement is under this division STOP 
START this tied in closely with the current attempt to UNK state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs in light of depreciation become excessive STOP 
START moreover it allows the present management to UNK vehicles so that mileage will be more UNK distributed throughout the fleet example if one driver puts on UNK miles per year and another driver UNK miles per year their cars will be switched so that both cars will have UNK miles after two years rather than UNK miles and related higher maintenance costs and UNK miles respectively STOP 
START the motor pool is a completely UNK and UNK operation STOP 
START it UNK all types of vehicle maintenance but UNK more on service station activities than on extensive vehicle UNK STOP 
START it contracts with outside repair UNK for much of the latter work STOP 
START where the pool UNK is in its UNK of maintenance and UNK studies and analyses STOP 
START pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per UNK of each vehicle the miles traveled in one year or three years the periods when vehicle costs become excessive and when cars should be UNK for sound UNK STOP 
START from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data STOP 
START in UNK vehicles averaged an operating cost of UNK per mile STOP 
START based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of UNK vehicles STOP 
START they estimate further that with sufficient experience and when UNK of compact cars is UNK the UNK point may be reduced to UNK miles of travel per year STOP 
START table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random STOP 
START one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities STOP 
START present pool quarters at two locations in providence are crowded UNK and in general make for UNK operation in terms of UNK of personnel and UNK of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment STOP 
START good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more STOP 
START purchasing practices STOP 
START -hlthe purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state STOP 
START requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made STOP 
START UNK are evaluated by the division of purchases with the assistance of pool staff and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible UNK STOP 
START unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public STOP 
START the reasons are obvious 1 the state is buying in quantity and 2 it has no federal UNK or state sales tax to pay STOP 
START until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of UNK discount through the dealers STOP 
START in that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the UNK fund mentioned earlier STOP 
START this is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately UNK principles STOP 
START the assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later STOP 
START vehicle purchase assignment and use policies probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicles STOP 
START the UNK role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles STOP 
START the more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state the director of administration STOP

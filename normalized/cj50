START unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely UNK as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues STOP 
START and this fact may explain some of the UNK among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the UNK of total costs among different units of service STOP 
START one such disagreement which will receive attention in this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service in order to avoid the UNK of discrimination must be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs STOP 
START here the choice is that between the UNK of a dilemma STOP 
START two major types of fully distributed cost analysis 1 STOP 
START -hlthe UNK type despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define relative costs the above UNK of fully distributed UNK goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice STOP 
START for more explicit UNK one must distinguish different types of analyses STOP 
START by all means the most important distinction is that between those UNK UNK which UNK a distribution of UNK UNK cost UNK on estimates of UNK or marginal costs and those other UNK which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere UNK distribution STOP 
START the first or UNK type might also be called the railroad type because of its application to railroads and other transportation agencies by the cost section of the interstate commerce commission STOP 
START the cost section UNK between directly variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter STOP 
START the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing UNK UNK costs a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the UNK UNK marginal costs STOP 
START there remains a UNK of total costs or total revenue requirements which since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density is strictly UNK on a UNK basis STOP 
START nevertheless because the cost section has felt UNK to make some kind of a distribution of total costs it has UNK this UNK which it sometimes calls burden among the units of UNK traffic on a basis partly ton partly UNK which is UNK quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination STOP 
START in recent years this burden which includes allowances for revenue UNK in the passenger business and in UNK freight traffic has UNK to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the UNK freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet STOP 
START since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates it will not attempt to UNK the methods by which the staff of the interstate commerce commission has estimated UNK costs and UNK UNK costs STOP 
START UNK it to say that the usefulness of the latter UNK is UNK STOP 
START but in any event full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in UNK analyses namely that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service a mere cost UNK which somehow UNK among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly UNK from the standpoint of specific cost determination STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe UNK type we turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which unlike the railroad type draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost UNK the UNK type STOP 
START it might be called the public utility type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases STOP 
START here no attempt is made first to determine UNK or marginal costs and then to UNK on these costs reasonably distributed UNK of total costs STOP 
START instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables STOP 
START moreover whereas in interstate commerce commission UNK variable cost means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output in the type of analysis now under review variable cost has been used more UNK so as to cover costs which while a function of some one variable such as output of energy or number of customers are not necessarily a linear function STOP 
START as already noted in an earlier paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service such as residential commercial industrial power street lighting etc. STOP 
START this grand division permits many costs to be assigned in their UNK to some one class such as street lighting or at least to be UNK completely from some important class or classes STOP 
START UNK industrial power service for example would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the UNK distribution lines STOP 
START but the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly all classes of customers these costs must somehow be UNK among the various classes and then must somehow be UNK among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates STOP 
START the general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly UNK problem of an UNK cost analysis STOP 
START but before turning to this example we must distinguish two UNK of analysis both of which belong to the UNK type rather than to the UNK type STOP 
START in the first UNK the UNK following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect UNK both total operating costs and total annual capital costs including an allowance for cost of capital or fair rate of return among the different classes and units of service STOP 
START here an UNK say of UNK of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential UNK STOP 
START but in the second UNK which i take to be the one more frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the cost of capital or fair return are UNK directly among the various classes of service STOP 
START to be sure the capital UNK in or UNK the estimated fair values of the plant and equipment are UNK among the different classes as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services STOP 
START but any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs UNK to this class is reported as a return realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service STOP 
START thus during any given year a if the revenues from the residential service are UNK b if the operating expenses UNK to this class of service come to UNK and c if the net investment in or value of the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to UNK the cost UNK will report that residential service in the UNK has yielded a return of UNK or UNK per cent STOP 
START other services will show different rates of return some probably much lower and some higher STOP 
START there are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding cost of capital from the direct UNK of annual costs among the different classes of service notably the UNK of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute cost of capital or fair rate of return STOP 
START but the practice is likely to be UNK since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the UNK operating expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the rates of charge for this service are UNK STOP 
START needless to say any such UNK would be quite UNK STOP 
START for the reason just suggested i shall assume the use of the first UNK of fully distributed cost UNK in the following UNK example STOP 
START that is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to be included directly in the cost UNK STOP 
START UNK analysis of the costs of an electric utility business in order to UNK the UNK of a typical fully UNK cost analysis let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own UNK plant STOP 
START let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc. to residential commercial and industrial customers STOP 
START this latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis the distinction among costs that are functions of UNK of the same service measured along different dimensions STOP 
START since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might suppose that the problem of total cost UNK would be very simple that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per UNK of consumption STOP 
START in fact however the problem is not so simple STOP 
START for a statement of costs per UNK would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of UNK output or consumption of energy STOP 
START a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required STOP 
START the UNK division and the one most frequently used with UNK in gas and electric rate cases is a UNK division of the total operating and capital costs into customer costs energy or UNK costs and demand or capacity costs STOP 
START if this UNK division of costs were to have its UNK in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does have in some rates there would result a UNK rate for any one class of service STOP 
START for example the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge a UNK charge for 250 UNK of energy at per UNK and a UNK charge for a maximum demand of 2 UNK during the month at the rate of $1 per UNK a total bill of UNK for that month STOP 
START but our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs STOP 
START let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn UNK that this UNK classification is used only for UNK purposes actually vary in much more complex ways STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START -hlthe customer costs these are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power consumption STOP 
START included as a minimum are the costs of UNK and UNK along with whatever other expenses the company must UNK in taking on another consumer STOP 
START these minimum costs may come to $1 per month more or less for residential and small commercial customers although they are substantially higher for large industrial UNK who require more costly connections and UNK devices STOP 
START while costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates in the form of a mere service charge they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which UNK the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment STOP 
START but the really controversial aspect of UNK UNK arises because of the cost UNK frequent practice of including not just those costs that can be definitely UNK as UNK for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary UNK distribution system a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a UNK system of minimum capacity STOP

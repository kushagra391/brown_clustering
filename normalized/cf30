START surrounded by ancient UNK the campus is UNK and beautiful STOP 
START the buildings are mostly UNK STOP 
START the dartmouth student does not live in UNK UNK as he once did STOP 
START but his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go far even though he may go fast for sophisticated UNK STOP 
START he is still UNK to the rare gifts of space and silence if he UNK to be STOP 
START he is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century down from the hills with bear UNK on his hair and a UNK for book learning in his heart STOP 
START the men's shops on UNK main street compare favorably with those in UNK and new haven STOP 
START and the automobiles that stream out of hanover each weekend toward smith and UNK and mount UNK are no less UNK than those leaving cambridge or west philadelphia STOP 
START but there has always been an outdoor air to dartmouth STOP 
START the UNK UNK and the UNK youth adopt this air without UNK STOP 
START no one here UNK fun at UNK virtues STOP 
START and this gives rise to an easy UNK probably UNK elsewhere in the UNK league STOP 
START it even affects the faculty STOP 
START thus when UNK winter UNK widely recognized as the greatest UNK UNK college weekend anywhere any time was broadcast over a national television UNK UNK john sloan UNK appeared on the screen in rugged winter UNK UNK off by a UNK which he UNK had been acquired from a smith girl STOP 
START president UNK golden UNK UNK in the snow at his feet added to the picture of UNK UNK STOP 
START this UNK UNK for side UNK up again in the same television broadcast STOP 
START dean UNK UNK wearing UNK clothes was UNK a UNK UNK queen of the UNK STOP 
START she must have looked UNK pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head STOP 
START so he kissed her STOP 
START no dartmouth man was surprised STOP 
START dartmouth students enjoy other unusual UNK with equal UNK STOP 
START for example groups regularly UNK down the connecticut river STOP 
START this is in honor of john UNK class of UNK who UNK a UNK out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days STOP 
START and these hardy UNK are not UNK today STOP 
START they are UNK by the nation's press and smith girls UNK the UNK at UNK and UNK the UNK with hot soup and UNK STOP 
START UNK favorite and most characteristic recreation is UNK STOP 
START since the days when their two thousand pairs of UNK UNK those assembled anywhere else in the united states the students have stopped regarding the UNK UNK team as another name for their own STOP 
START yet dartmouth still is the dominant member of the UNK UNK union which includes the winter sports colleges of canada as well as those of this country STOP 
START dartmouth students UNK everywhere in winter starting with their own front door STOP 
START they can hire a horse and go UNK behind him or move out to oak hill where there's a lift STOP 
START the dartmouth UNK at UNK UNK ten miles north of the campus has one of the best UNK in the east ranging from UNK to expert STOP 
START forty miles farther north is mount UNK UNK own mountain STOP 
START here at the UNK lodge president UNK acts as host every year to about a hundred UNK who are being introduced by the dartmouth UNK club to life on the trails STOP 
START the lodge built of UNK virgin UNK can handle fifty people for dining sleeping or UNK in its huge living room STOP 
START the UNK club also owns a chain of fourteen UNK and several shelters extending from the vermont hills just across the river from the college through hanover to the college grant UNK acres of wilderness UNK miles north up in the UNK country STOP 
START the UNK are equipped with bunks blankets and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for UNK and UNK trips STOP 
START the club runs regular trips to the UNK but many of the students prefer to take off in small UNK groups for a weekend of hunting fishing climbing or UNK STOP 
START under the UNK of the UNK club dartmouth also has the UNK club which takes on tough UNK like mount mckinley and UNK bullet whose interests are UNK and even sports a UNK team which UNK with other new england colleges in wood UNK and UNK UNK races and the like STOP 
START there is much to be said for a college that while happily UNK to the sophisticated UNK still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game deer or even bear is not UNK STOP 
START city boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an UNK handle or in the sharp UNK of a UNK come upon suddenly in a UNK UNK camp STOP 
START and on the summit of mount washington where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the UNK because it is there STOP 
START there is much to be said for such a college and dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly STOP 
START their affection for their college home has even caused president UNK to comment on this place loyalty as something rather UNK UNK STOP 
START probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the supreme court of the united states STOP 
START early in the nineteenth century the state of new hampshire was UNK about for a way to found its own state university STOP 
START it fixed on dartmouth college which was UNK and just what the UNK ordered STOP 
START the legislators decided to UNK dartmouth and entered into a UNK with the college trustees over the control of UNK faculty and chapel STOP 
START for a time there were two UNK on the campus fighting for possession of the student body STOP 
START the struggle was resolved in UNK in the supreme court in one of the most UNK cases in our judicial history STOP 
START in UNK the lawyers were generally UNK the legal UNK of private contracts and UNK STOP 
START a lawyer hired by the college was UNK specifically for dartmouth daniel UNK class of UNK made her UNK the dramatic focus of his whole plea STOP 
START in an age of UNK he was the king of UNK and both he himself and chief justice marshall were UNK in UNK tears as uncle UNK reached his UNK climax it is sir as i have said a small college and yet there are those who love it STOP 
START dartmouth is today still a small college and still a private one thanks to UNK UNK STOP 
START this is not out of keeping with its UNK probably the most humble of any in the UNK group STOP 
START UNK UNK a presbyterian minister founded the school in UNK UNK it after the second earl of dartmouth its sponsor and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK on the hanover plain found its great forests and UNK good and with his own hands built the first college hall a log hut dedicated for the education instruction of youth of the indian tribes in this land in reading writing all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and UNK for UNK UNK children of UNK as well as in all liberal arts and sciences also of english youth and any others STOP 
START it was a hardy UNK and UNK was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness STOP 
START a road had to be UNK through UNK forests between hanover and UNK to permit governor UNK and a company of gentlemen to attend the first dartmouth UNK in UNK STOP 
START the governor and his UNK thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver UNK which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college STOP 
START the UNK on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth UNK STOP 
START a student UNK produced tears from a great number of the learned even before the UNK was served STOP 
START then from the branches of a UNK tree an indian UNK UNK both the platform and the english language UNK the UNK in his UNK tongue STOP 
START governor UNK contributed an UNK for a barbecue on the green beneath the UNK UNK and a barrel of UNK was UNK STOP 
START the cook got drunk and president UNK proved to be a man of broad talents by UNK the UNK himself STOP 
START future UNK were more UNK perhaps but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace STOP 
START by the end of the nineteenth century in UNK when the big three columbia and UNK were UNK centers of learning dartmouth graduated only UNK STOP 
START the UNK including the beloved dartmouth hall could barely house two hundred students in UNK fashion STOP 
START then in UNK dr. william UNK UNK became president and the UNK great UNK began STOP 
START he transformed dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college STOP 
START by UNK the number of UNK had UNK to UNK STOP 
START and at his last UNK in that year dr. UNK and dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors UNK to the new stature of the college STOP 
START the presidents of UNK wisconsin UNK UNK vermont brown columbia UNK yale and harvard and the presidents UNK of harvard and michigan were there STOP 
START dartmouth is UNK still a small college today with approximately UNK hundred UNK STOP 
START but it has achieved a UNK of students from almost all the states and two-thirds of its UNK come from outside new england STOP 
START over UNK different schools are usually represented in each entering class STOP 
START only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation STOP 
START about two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools STOP 
START it is still a college only and not a university is in fact the only college in the UNK group STOP 
START however three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional UNK the dartmouth medical school third oldest in the country and founded in UNK the thayer school of engineering and the UNK UNK school of business administration STOP 
START all three are UNK kept small with a current total UNK of about two hundred STOP 
START all three schools UNK their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and like the college proper place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study STOP 
START students of the college who are candidates for the UNK degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year thus completing the UNK UNK course in one year STOP 
START the thayer school offers a year of UNK study in somewhat the same way after a boy UNK a UNK in engineering STOP 
START so dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the UNK group STOP 
START it is still however the junior member of the league if not in years at least in the UNK up it has had to do STOP 
START it has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other UNK have enjoyed STOP 
START however much football has been UNK the public likes to measure its UNK favorites by the UNK so while yale need never give its record a thought again since UNK its opponents UNK to 0 in the season of UNK dartmouth had to wait until its UNK team of UNK for national recognition STOP 
START it has come on with a rush in more significant areas STOP 
START today it UNK certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat UNK STOP 
START but dartmouth preserves its youthful UNK even in its educational attitudes and although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage they make for lively copy STOP 
START president UNK UNK once proposed to UNK an UNK of brains in hanover STOP

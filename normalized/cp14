START she was moving through a screen of UNK in among the white UNK and UNK STOP 
START the sounds from the UNK began to UNK in her ears STOP 
START she stood once more listening STOP 
START she had never been here at this hour STOP 
START she felt as if some dark totally UNK shape would UNK at her arm she found the path she always used the UNK of branches she had broken those she had pushed aside she walked easily now and more slowly until she could see the dark UNK of water beneath her STOP 
START if i ever committed suicide she thought i would dive straight down from here and no one would find me for days STOP 
START she smiled and UNK let herself downward holding this known root or that her UNK sliding in the leaves STOP 
START she jumped out onto the flat UNK of rock and UNK herself shook her UNK brown hair and tilted her chin far upward STOP 
START the UNK music of the UNK had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until it was UNK STOP 
START julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and UNK her hands tightly around the bent knees STOP 
START she had accomplished a miracle STOP 
START this was her place STOP 
START the hour couldn't change it STOP 
START only only her thoughts were a little strange STOP 
START they were becoming confused STOP 
START perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had no business to be here now STOP 
START she was thinking of paul a few weeks ago in the easter holidays with her at one of those awful friday evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend STOP 
START UNK UNK how are you then off he went so casually to someone else with UNK better developed more obvious in a UNK dress someone without a UNK of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him STOP 
START i wish he was with me now she thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only UNK and acute UNK STOP 
START oh god wish i were older or younger julia UNK thought STOP 
START i wish so much someone loved me STOP 
START george UNK remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night UNK in a white UNK standing like a ghost at the threshold STOP 
START she had vanished must have slept again STOP 
START he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him STOP 
START it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning STOP 
START this room was like a prison STOP 
START he would not be UNK to sam him as if at the end of some remote UNK he heard the UNK of a vacuum UNK STOP 
START his fingers UNK across the UNK STOP 
START they had left both of his eyes UNK STOP 
START well he told himself let's put the show on the road STOP 
START he was walking across to the bathroom STOP 
START he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands STOP 
START a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water were UNK up through the blood vessels and expanding them STOP 
START he recognized his jacket and UNK STOP 
START the fabric was dark UNK weren't too apparent there were his shoes thank god but his shirt was one terrible mess STOP 
START he UNK and then tore away the UNK parts and wound the rest around his neck like a UNK STOP 
START sam would be amazed to find him gone STOP 
START UNK would have to understand STOP 
START she must have put his clothes in the closet STOP 
START he found a UNK rising in his throat because of that one simple act of UNK STOP 
START he was on the UNK of tears STOP 
START alex UNK in a fashion he owed a debt to that UNK gentleman STOP 
START at least alex had told him he wasn't dying STOP 
START perhaps george UNK would be better off dead STOP 
START what time was it peered at his UNK STOP 
START strange it was still running STOP 
START a quarter to seven STOP 
START too early for a vacuum UNK but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs STOP 
START he was UNK to tie his UNK STOP 
START his fingers felt UNK thick and UNK STOP 
START he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door STOP 
START he barely knew himself STOP 
START this was some UNK two UNK of UNK tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass of UNK suddenly moist over his UNK STOP 
START the surface however was perfectly white STOP 
START he was drinking another glass of water STOP 
START it was after seven o'clock STOP 
START he was supposed to be in court this afternoon at city hall STOP 
START who would take over have to think but the main thing the UNK necessity was to leave before sam UNK was up and about and before UNK UNK him with sympathy STOP 
START he entered the UNK STOP 
START he was actually walking down the stairs STOP 
START a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this UNK UNK of a man desperately trying to get away STOP 
START father is that you voice issued from the UNK of the hall below STOP 
START george did not reply STOP 
START is that you father there a moment he felt like a UNK discovered STOP 
START then julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room STOP 
START she stood UNK at him STOP 
START uncle george was trying to smile at her STOP 
START UNK shouldn't be up should you i i was just leaving here UNK STOP 
START i'm all set STOP 
START just about to call a taxi STOP 
START she was wearing some sort of gray UNK STOP 
START she seemed UNK tall her UNK UNK in concern STOP 
START well at least you won't have to do that she was saying STOP 
START i'm about to leave myself STOP 
START i'll drop you off STOP 
START you're leaving i'm going back to school she answered STOP 
START UNK driving me STOP 
START i'm just UNK breakfast STOP 
START but have you told mother you were going asked him STOP 
START no STOP 
START i just don't want anyone disturbed UNK STOP 
START that's my wish STOP 
START it's quite a big one he added STOP 
START her face seemed to UNK in an UNK bright shaft of sunlight STOP 
START well won't you come in then have a cup of coffee or something maybe a drink asked in a way that seemed UNK sophisticated UNK and yet perhaps partly UNK STOP 
START he tried to see her face more clearly STOP 
START no nothing at all he said after a UNK UNK STOP 
START i'll just wait for you here STOP 
START he leaned his head against the wood UNK behind him but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his UNK STOP 
START he raised them STOP 
START julia moved past STOP 
START i have to say UNK upstairs STOP 
START i won't be long STOP 
START as a great favor UNK he said please don't mention you've seen me STOP 
START not to anyone no please STOP 
START i'll call your mother as soon as i get home STOP 
START it'll be so much easier STOP 
START all right she was staring at him STOP 
START i'm fine UNK STOP 
START please you just go ahead STOP 
START she had disappeared STOP 
START he could feel a UNK UNK against the UNK STOP 
START he imagined UNK voice george what the hell goes on wouldn't have the strength to answer he thought STOP 
START maybe i couldn't have called a taxi STOP 
START he could hear the UNK overhead STOP 
START he saw the suitcase which julia was holding STOP 
START he stood up STOP 
START i'll take that UNK for you STOP 
START oh no she said STOP 
START i can manage STOP 
START she went ahead of him STOP 
START outside the lincoln was parked STOP 
START he could hardly believe he was getting in STOP 
START UNK was UNK at him in an UNK UNK fashion that didn't matter STOP 
START we'll drop mr. UNK off in UNK julia said and for the UNK second george was reminded of her father's tone with servants STOP 
START to the manner born odd to have such a thought at a time like this her UNK seemed forced or UNK STOP 
START he could not stop to UNK STOP 
START he had never felt particularly close to her STOP 
START UNK seemed more UNK but obviously julia had respected his request STOP 
START he took her hand STOP 
START i wish i didn't have to go back to school she said and then i wish you lived in new york STOP 
START that's in the opposite direction STOP 
START i wish i did he responded STOP 
START i wish i wasn't wearing this ridiculous UNK and that we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we knew he stopped speaking STOP 
START forget we ever knew what oh just sort of everything in general STOP 
START she said nothing until UNK had UNK their pace STOP 
START i know you feel badly but that sounds like such a UNK thing for you to say STOP 
START does it asked STOP 
START yes perhaps STOP 
START i'm supposed to joke about things aren't i sometimes life can be rather a UNK business STOP 
START his voice seemed thick and UNK STOP 
START he UNK her hand STOP 
START he could see the stone building where he lived STOP 
START just a few more steps STOP 
START abruptly he reached into his pocket STOP 
START yes there was the key STOP 
START are you positive you'll be all right by yourself asked him STOP 
START for a moment he smiled STOP 
START yes UNK dear STOP 
START you've done me the greatest possible service STOP 
START by myself i'll be fine STOP 
START take care of yourself then STOP 
START i will STOP 
START you also STOP 
START don't work too hard STOP 
START it was an automatic phrase he crossed through the UNK he regretted it STOP 
START he should have discovered a more tender farewell STOP 
START someone shouted at him well you look at george UNK happened to you i UNK into a door handle george said STOP 
START someone laughed STOP 
START george walked steadily ahead into his entry STOP 
START his UNK seemed on fire STOP 
START he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it STOP 
START in the UNK the raw whiskey made him UNK STOP 
START just one or two UNK he told himself enough to UNK some of the pain STOP 
START he was UNK STOP 
START no UNK i'm home STOP 
START no really right as rain STOP 
START tell sam not to worry about the car STOP 
START i'll get it UNK away STOP

START yes sure i'll see the doctor this evening if you insist STOP 
START there was one more call to make STOP 
START joan did i wake you asked STOP 
START yes i thought you'd probably be up STOP 
START look UNK some fool was STOP 
START happened to be driving somewhat UNK last night STOP 
START unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss STOP 
START oh hell no i'm not in a hospital STOP 
START i won't be in town for a couple of days though and there's that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon STOP 
START too bad a jury isn't involved STOP 
START i might struggle in for a jury STOP 
START i'd win hands down STOP 
START but i thought maybe tony UNK could UNK for me STOP 
START he'll understand you might give him sort of a UNK UNK STOP 
START he's got all the facts STOP 
START i wouldn't want to ask for a UNK it's really just a routine thing STOP 
START what darling i'd rather you didn't come out STOP 
START a smile pulled at the lower strip of UNK tape STOP 
START don't even send flowers STOP 
START i'll see you wednesday STOP 
START i'll UNK you with a nice he was about to say double UNK but thought better of it STOP 
START i'll take you out to dinner STOP 
START okay he had put down the receiver STOP 
START a strange relationship between joan UNK and himself STOP 
START who knew about it lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those UNK houses whose brick UNK some early UNK had constructed STOP 
START she had two tiny rooms on the second floor STOP 
START she was a clever girl a most efficient secretary STOP 
START she let him come and go as he pleased or as it pleased her STOP 
START in the office you might have thought them only casual friends if he said make an excuse yourself come out here today she would have been on the next train and similarly if she had been in need he would have gone to her STOP

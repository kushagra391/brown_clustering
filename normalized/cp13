START but one night UNK moved in the direction of the women's lodge where shades of night had gone to UNK herself STOP 
START with the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill UNK the UNK with his lips making it whisper STOP 
START he saw her emerge suddenly coming in her UNK fashion her back stiff her head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter as if in her extreme UNK and indifference she would pass by all the UNK looks of those whom she might approach STOP 
START in her dark UNK fashion she proceeded to her UNK afraid of nothing not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding STOP 
START seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart UNK in him and turned away afraid now STOP 
START even he wanting her afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil UNK in her UNK more STOP 
START his breath caught and trembling he closed his eyes and stumbled off STOP 
START going he saw as often before some UNK hideous yellow face over his head shining and UNK like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the UNK when they are perhaps pressed by the UNK STOP 
START he cried out to her his back turned STOP 
START then he fled not waiting to see if she UNK him or took notice of his cry STOP 
START but she heard him go STOP 
START yet she did not UNK and only turned slightly her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way toward the end of the camp STOP 
START elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited the women UNK from their UNK then gathering in small curious UNK STOP 
START early spring came from her bed from beside her UNK husband UNK and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild UNK the sound of UNK voices STOP 
START standing there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge silent almost UNK her body UNK simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of UNK waited perhaps UNK the UNK that moved in her STOP 
START when at last she could suffer the UNK no longer nor face the UNK UNK she said in a voice UNK i shall call your father back where you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame the girl said only tell him i am here that i have come STOP 
START and it was not pile of clouds she meant STOP 
START but now with real anger at last something proud and UNK early spring stood like a she UNK before her UNK and cried i will not UNK at you will tell you to go not UNK STOP 
START telling you UNK the knife she used for UNK UNK she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her side STOP 
START you bring only UNK she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the UNK hunger of a wild animal STOP 
START speaking in a low voice of UNK she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright UNK bearing and did not even look at the knife STOP 
START go take UNK your evil spirit to the young boys the woman said STOP 
START they do not have to face battle STOP 
START i will not let your evil in STOP 
START i will simply kill you first STOP 
START now go other women had come close now their voices UNK together until they stood UNK in an angry UNK their threats UNK rising UNK at each other each trying to make her UNK and anger felt STOP 
START they picked up sticks and UNK them at the girl STOP 
START the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them UNK her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her UNK STOP 
START they were all shouting at her as if she were the UNK of the evil she brought STOP 
START but she did not move taking the words and the sticks in that old UNK of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came UNK among them swinging a great UNK whip STOP 
START go back to your UNK shouted STOP 
START a pack of dogs makes less noise made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some UNK over themselves in their flight STOP 
START and early spring seized the whip and said if you must UNK someone let it be her your daughter STOP 
START drive the UNK out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband the old man turned on her UNK the whip from her hand STOP 
START get into your UNK UNK STOP 
START go back to that UNK man of yours who so UNK his fine body among the young women STOP 
START keep him back if you must tell me what to do STOP 
START i will be the one to UNK my daughter not the wife of him who leads her to sin UNK before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where UNK stirred UNK sitting up in a half UNK to say what UNK thing happens thought i dreamed of UNK fighting STOP 
START but she went to him and pressed herself against his UNK UNK the UNK odor of the whisky he had stolen from UNK STOP 
START she said there is nothing that concerns you here STOP 
START lie back and go to sleep STOP 
START but do not dream STOP 
START do not let the UNK spirits enter your brain STOP 
START he sank back UNK and was soon asleep again STOP 
START outside the old man beyond all the UNK of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and twisted the UNK UNK of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her UNK ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms STOP 
START and UNK her against a UNK her back to him he UNK with the whip and made it UNK and crack in the damp air UNK its arc until it UNK to her flesh and the sound of it UNK and cracked settling its own cruel UNK on her shoulders while she stood as UNK as dark and UNK as ever her eyes open and staring at the pale UNK of the bark so close to her face STOP 
START she said to him her father how was i UNK in pain or joy it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me all know your foolish name stared at the pale UNK on the tree hearing her breath UNK from it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark STOP 
START she felt the UNK UNK and heard her father say in UNK UNK words which had no meaning like UNK sounds of an animal in rage and despair STOP 
START suddenly the UNK stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high UNK voice did you follow me to see my shame from the line or i will settle the whip on you STOP 
START move you hear the anger of the UNK UNK the girl saw UNK standing between his narrow shoulders UNK his arms hanging long and UNK STOP 
START he said let me take her UNK for there are UNK in me too STOP 
START then without knowing why she found herself running from them UNK wildly through the trees UNK her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the UNK ground with a big stone in the center behind which she UNK and UNK listening to the UNK of her heart and wanting for once to cry STOP 
START for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of UNK UNK in his harsh language as he talked with himself STOP 
START he shouted like a UNK old UNK his hair stiff and UNK STOP 
START he UNK and UNK the UNK of his enemies walking in circles in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great UNK UNK until finally UNK and sick he fell into his own UNK STOP 
START he UNK the young men who had been silent long enough STOP 
START but they could taste the UNK of violence and UNK through his UNK STOP 
START now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again UNK the gloom they saw in the faces around them STOP 
START they came out and held their games and races STOP 
START it was they who held the future in their hands STOP 
START they went into the sun together and UNK UNK in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred UNK dug far off in the UNK of UNK STOP 
START they UNK the UNK wildly at night the war dance and UNK their UNK in the UNK of UNK and rode their horses in swift UNK firing their few guns in UNK at some UNK signal STOP 
START UNK was among them and UNK and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing STOP 
START and a very young one UNK UNK tried to UNK them and followed UNK STOP 
START yellow UNK was there UNK of the young chief by an older brother long dead in whom also the UNK UNK of youth worked STOP 
START he would spring UNK upright suddenly after sitting quietly with UNK because something had UNK over in his UNK UNK STOP 
START all the young men UNK among them UNK them in matched racing STOP 
START they raced and UNK for war swinging their horses in single file and then UNK like cavalry STOP 
START at times they would ride UNK through the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they were in their UNK STOP 
START then again they would stand in circles making other preparations STOP 
START they UNK their hair and UNK it at the part and UNK the UNK so that the hair above their UNK stood rigid like the UNK of UNK UNK making love STOP 
START UNK UNK his UNK with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees STOP 
START he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a UNK arrow from the UNK bow UNK with a mad grace his UNK shining and UNK with meadow UNK STOP 
START he was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him UNK him STOP 
START and the suspicious UNK eyes of pile of clouds STOP 
START and those of early spring UNK and now full of hurt and UNK STOP 
START he felt so much like laughing like shouting and crying out from the UNK from which he could UNK as an UNK in a mad UNK from the UNK STOP 
START he and UNK planned a great parade with the young men STOP 
START they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their UNK STOP 
START they would ride with UNK UNK their colors UNK in the sun shouting the last UNK of a nation in the UNK of death STOP 
START and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood shifting then into the full heat and UNK which ran with their hearts STOP 
START they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills STOP 
START the young chief stared at the wall of his lodge listening STOP 
START the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad UNK UNK of the UNK horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell STOP 
START he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge STOP 
START standing then with the others UNK into the sun he saw the bright UNK UNK their hair flying like dark UNK only the thunder the roll of drums the mad UNK of the UNK accompanying them STOP 
START they leaned into the wind and seemed like one UNK UNK UNK and UNK until suddenly they rose straight in their UNK and in one UNK voice shouted UNK their UNK cry of war STOP

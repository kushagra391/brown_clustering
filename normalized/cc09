START UNK louis and his dance company appeared at the henry street UNK on friday and saturday evenings and sunday afternoons in the UNK of his latest work signal and the repetition of an earlier one journal STOP 
START signal is UNK for three male dancers to an electronic score by UNK UNK STOP 
START its abstract UNK is by john UNK STOP 
START program note reads as follows take hands urgent UNK UNK us STOP 
START here as in journal mr. louis has given himself the UNK share of the dancing and there is no doubt that he is capable of UNK and UNK a wide variety of difficult and UNK physical movements STOP 
START indeed both journal and signal qualify as UNK UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START but UNK of movements are not necessarily UNK and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove UNK STOP 
START one frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be UNK without notable loss of effect there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development STOP 
START it may be of course that mr. louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total UNK STOP 
START but it may be also that he is merely more UNK of UNK than of UNK at the present time STOP 
START one thing is certain however and that is that he is far more UNK to the detailed UNK UNK and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be STOP 
START an american journey a UNK UNK UNK of contemporary american UNK entitled an american journey was given its first new york performance at hunter college UNK last night by the helen UNK UNK dance company STOP 
START UNK by mr. UNK the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first new york showing of miss UNK once upon a time as well as her women's song and mr. UNK UNK figure STOP 
START eugene lester assembled a UNK and explicit score for an american journey and UNK UNK gave it UNK imaginative costumes STOP 
START mr. UNK has described four places each with its scenery and people added two UNK and concluded with a UNK for the young a UNK UNK interpretation of UNK dancing STOP 
START the places could be anywhere the UNK and UNK observed there could be UNK and the laugh is on us all STOP 
START but we need not mind too much because mr. UNK has expressed it through movement that is UNK and clever almost all the way STOP 
START miss UNK once upon a time is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures that bother them somehow STOP 
START unfortunately the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the UNK figures failed to make them any more so STOP 
START nor did the dancing involved really UNK the attention at any time STOP 
START the music here russell UNK UNK sounded good STOP 
START all the performances of the evening were smooth and assured and the sizable company with mr. UNK and UNK scott as its leading dancers seemed to be fine shape STOP 
START the symphony of the air greatly UNK by van UNK last night got its UNK beethoven cycle at UNK hall off to a good start STOP 
START at the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at UNK and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs UNK each of them in five different communities STOP 
START this news announced by UNK UNK the UNK administrative director brought applause from the UNK persons who filled the hall STOP 
START they showed they were glad that UNK would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the UNK with the departure to lincoln center of the new york UNK the philadelphia orchestra and the boston symphony STOP 
START this season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six UNK concerts for the UNK society of UNK in the county center in white plains STOP 
START the details of the suburban concerts next season and the centers in which they will be given will be announced later mr. UNK said STOP 
START the UNK that van UNK has been associated with in new york since his UNK return from russia in 1958 have been the UNK the UNK third and the prokofieff third STOP 
START it was pleasant last night therefore to hear him do something else a concerto he has recently recorded the emperor STOP 
START the young texas pianist can make great UNK ring out as well as anyone so last night the massive UNK of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him STOP 
START but they were not what distinguished his performance STOP 
START the elements that did were the UNK slow movement the beautiful transition to the third movement and the passages of UNK that UNK through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK gave the slow movement some of the quality of a UNK UNK STOP 
START alfred UNK the conductor sensitive UNK that he is picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding poetic mystery STOP 
START the collaboration was remarkable as it was in both the other movements too STOP 
START mr. UNK who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle also conducted the UNK UNK no. 3 and the fourth symphony STOP 
START the orchestra was obviously on its UNK and it played most UNK STOP 
START and although there was plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and UNK yet full of the UNK tension that is one of the UNK of beethoven STOP 
START UNK UNK will be the next UNK on feb. 4 STOP 
START there are times when one UNK that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in STOP 
START today in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show it is understandable that a song no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it STOP 
START in the more casually constructed UNK of the nineteen UNK and nineteen UNK there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit STOP 
START yet there is the classic case of the UNK the man i love STOP 
START deemed too static when it was first heard in lady be good in philadelphia in UNK it was dropped from the score STOP 
START it was heard again in philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of strike up the band and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up STOP 
START it finally reached broadway in the second and successful version of strike up the band in UNK STOP 
START still another song in strike up the band i've got a UNK on you was UNK from a UNK failure UNK girl STOP 
START second chance like the UNK richard UNK and UNK hart were UNK to let a good song get away from them STOP 
START if one of mr. UNK UNK seemed to deserve a better fate than UNK in boston or the UNK of a broadway failure mr. hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show STOP 
START several of these double entries have been collected by ben UNK and michael UNK along with UNK and hart songs that disappeared permanently UNK route to new york and others that reached broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard UNK and hart UNK in a UNK UNK UNK UNK and hart UNK UNK records UNK fifth avenue new york STOP 
START among the particular UNK in this collection is the UNK opening song of the UNK UNK an impressive UNK of the wit and melody that were to come from UNK and hart in the years that followed UNK UNK UNK of the UNK at the UNK music hall from i married an angel the UNK style with which charlotte UNK UNK the UNK hart lyrics of i UNK a song that was cut from a connecticut yankee STOP 
START altogether fifteen virtually unknown UNK and hart songs are sung by a UNK of able UNK STOP 
START norman paris has provided them with extremely effective UNK UNK STOP 
START turning to the current musical season on broadway the most widely UNK of the new UNK how to succeed in business without really trying has been transferred to an original cast UNK r. c. a. victor UNK UNK UNK UNK that has some entertaining moments although it is scarcely as UNK as the praise UNK by the show might lead one to expect STOP 
START robert morse singing with UNK UNK UNK carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in frank UNK score STOP 
START UNK UNK who shares star UNK with mr. morse makes only two appearances STOP 
START he shares with mr. morse a UNK of the college UNK he once sang while his second song is UNK away from him by virginia martin a girl with a remarkably UNK UNK in her voice STOP 
START in general mr. UNK has done a more consistent job as UNK than he has as composer STOP 
START like mr. UNK jerry UNK is both composer and UNK for milk and honey r. c. a. victor UNK UNK UNK UNK but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics STOP 
START for this story of an american couple who meet and fall in love in israel mr. UNK has written songs that are UNK UNK and dance music that UNK STOP 
START UNK voices there are the UNK UNK voices of robert UNK UNK UNK and tommy UNK to make the most of mr. UNK UNK UNK and for an occasional change of pace the bright humor of UNK UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from israel and the standard american UNK style in a manner that stresses the basic UNK of both UNK STOP 
START not content to create only the music and lyrics UNK UNK also wrote the book and directed sail away capitol UNK UNK UNK UNK a UNK of life on a UNK ship that is not apt to be included among mr. UNK more memorable works STOP 
START the UNK flow along UNK as mr. UNK songs usually do but his lyrics have a tired UNK quality STOP 
START elaine UNK who UNK with a UNK warm UNK UNK some life into most of her songs but the other members of the cast sound as UNK as mr. UNK songs STOP 
START with three fine russian films in recent months on world war 2 the house i live in the UNK are flying and UNK of a soldier we had every right to expect a real soviet UNK in the day the war ended STOP 
START it simply isn't not by a long shot STOP 
START the UNK presentation with english titles opened on saturday at the UNK theatre STOP 
START make no mistake this UNK studio drama is a respectable import UNK grave carefully written performed and directed STOP 
START in describing the initial allied occupation of a UNK german city the picture has color UNK pull and UNK moving moments STOP 
START told strictly from the viewpoint of the russian UNK the film UNK UNK over the shoulders of a UNK soviet couple at both sides of the UNK UNK STOP 
START unfortunately the whole picture UNK on this romance at the expense of everything else STOP 
START UNK and rather UNK the camera UNK on the abrupt deep love of a pretty nurse and a UNK teacher complicated by nothing more than a friend they don't want to hurt STOP 
START it's the old story war or no war and more than one UNK may recall UNK UNK several seasons back when the UNK concern was for the UNK UNK of a society UNK STOP 
START not that the picture is UNK STOP 
START under UNK UNK direction it begins UNK as UNK soviet and nazi troops silently UNK each other waiting for the first surrender gesture STOP 
START one UNK camera shot is magnificent as the germans UNK from a UNK UNK a huge UNK square and drop their weapons STOP

START doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies STOP 
START it was nevertheless almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a complete split over germany with hot heads on both sides planning to use the germans against their former allies and with UNK germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START when the yalta conference opened the american policy of UNK all discussion of russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down STOP 
START starting in great force late in december from a line stretching from east UNK to UNK the red armies had swept two hundred miles across poland to the UNK thirty miles from berlin and the upper UNK region was being rapidly UNK while the western allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the UNK STOP 
START the long delay in opening the second front was now working to russia's advantage STOP 
START the west was now glad to propose the UNK UNK line which was substantially russia's 1941 border as the boundary between russia and poland STOP 
START when this proposal was made stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference STOP 
START he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject STOP 
START the bitter memory of russia's UNK from the paris peace conference and of the UNK effort to UNK out UNK at its birth UNK up within him STOP 
START you would drive us into shame he declared STOP 
START the white russians and the UNK would say that stalin and UNK were far less reliable UNK of russia than UNK and UNK STOP 
START yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted the UNK line and even agreed UNK that there should be UNK from that line of five to eight UNK in favor of poland in some regions STOP 
START he did not mind the line itself which churchill declared in the house of UNK on february 27 1945 he had always believed to be just and right but he did not want it called by a hated name STOP 
START the west had long since forgotten the events of UNK but it was not so easy for the red leaders who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period STOP 
START in the UNK UNK of february 4 1942 the state department had expected to be able to hold russia in check by UNK agreement to her 1941 boundaries STOP 
START now stalin made it clear that he meant to move UNK western borders deep into germany back to the western UNK river lines taking not only east UNK and all of UNK but UNK and the tip of UNK back to and including UNK STOP 
START from six to nine million additional germans would be UNK though most would have fled and poland would receive far more from germany than the poor UNK including the great UNK UNK which she lost to russia STOP 
START stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer although it costs us blood in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense of the germans STOP 
START by this time churchill was not so UNK toward moving poland UNK as he had been at UNK where he and UNK had both UNK approved the idea STOP 
START after a prolonged study of the UNK line on a map at UNK churchill liked the picture STOP 
START he would tell the poles he said that they had been given a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way STOP 
START at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected to the western UNK river being chosen in the south instead of the eastern UNK both of which flow into the UNK STOP 
START the issue was left in UNK presumably for the peace conference STOP 
START however there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong poland both UNK and UNK and one UNK by large UNK of germans or russians STOP 
START the moving of millions of the german UNK from the very heart of UNK to make room for the polish UNK whom they had UNK and openly planned to UNK was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it was historically justified STOP 
START government STOP 
START UNK more importance to the west than UNK boundaries was the character of her government STOP 
START at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could be kept in its orbit in spite of the UNK soviet armies STOP 
START though little democracy had ever been UNK in this region and much of it was still ruled by UNK means it was taken for granted that at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this area and western capitalism preserved within it STOP 
START believing UNK as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it was important to both roosevelt and churchill that the poles should have them STOP 
START the issue was acute because the UNK polish government in london supported in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin government formed behind the red army STOP 
START more time was spent in trying to marry these UNK than over any subject discussed at yalta STOP 
START the result was an agreement that the lublin government should be UNK on a broader democratic basis with the UNK of democratic leaders from poland itself and from the poles abroad and UNK to hold free and UNK elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal UNK and secret ballot STOP 
START all democratic and UNK parties were to have the right to campaign STOP 
START roosevelt acted as UNK of the long debate on this issue STOP 
START it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had declared war in behalf of poland STOP 
START to stalin it was a matter of life and death STOP 
START he made this completely clear STOP 
START speaking with great UNK he said for the russian people the question of poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security STOP 
START throughout history poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into russia STOP 
START twice in the last thirty years our enemies the germans have passed through this corridor STOP 
START it is in russia's interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force STOP 
START it is necessary that poland should be free independent in power STOP 
START therefore it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the soviet state STOP 
START in other words the soviet union was determined to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful UNK against germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a UNK UNK against the soviets or UNK as an independent UNK power in between russia and germany STOP 
START UNK says that invariably thereafter the soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in poland STOP 
START this reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be STOP 
START any free elections that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government in which moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the west for free voting by UNK elements in poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START UNK europe in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern europe where the upper classes had generally UNK with the nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into russia as a part of UNK armies STOP 
START but at yalta the UNK expectations of east and west were UNK into an agreement by the big three to assist all UNK countries in europe to create democratic institutions of their own choice STOP 
START in any case here in their judgment conditions require UNK added they would form interim governmental authorities UNK representative of all democratic elements in the population and UNK to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments UNK to the will of the people STOP 
START other similar UNK in the declaration on UNK europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the western model STOP 
START later it developed that the soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed later and their judgment never told them that the big three should UNK in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them within their zone of influence STOP 
START professor UNK thinks that at yalta stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him that he thought the UNK of the UNK voters from east european elections would not be greatly UNK by his allies while neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly faced the fact that in poland at least UNK free democratic elections would return governments UNK to russia by any definition of international UNK STOP 
START also UNK propaganda and cooperation had UNK the differences between russian and western ideas of democracy and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal UNK than to UNK the military UNK over germany and japan STOP 
START the application of these UNK could not please both sides for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable STOP 
START while obliged to UNK governments in east europe allied with the soviet union instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in east europe STOP 
START this illusion was described in a UNK editorial in the new york herald tribune on march 5 1947 in connection with the UNK of the UNK peace UNK to the senate STOP 
START in doing so marshall and UNK were asking for the UNK of a grim lesson in the facts of international life STOP 
START we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world STOP 
START we were troubled about the fate of the UNK states STOP 
START yalta left us with UNK UNK of a western UNK political economy UNK supreme up to the UNK line and the borders of UNK UNK added STOP 
START this is a penetrating description of our UNK illusion which applied to other areas than east europe STOP 
START the same editorial continued that we expected to UNK japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily on our institutions STOP 
START we expected in short that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple from such a position to deal with the UNK UNK of the soviet union STOP 
START yet actually the image UNK in no way to the UNK of the UNK world STOP 
START neither our military our economic nor our ideological power reached far enough to determine the fate of east europe STOP 
START then the editorial added UNK how far they may reach in asia is yet UNK but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences STOP 
START here is the best short explanation of the UNK of the cold war that has been written STOP 
START failing to UNK the lesson so clearly contained in the UNK UNK president truman UNK the cold war on march 12 1947 in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald tribune editorial was written and a year after the cold war had been announced by churchill at fulton missouri in UNK presence STOP 
START then china promptly went communist and mr. truman had to fight the UNK korean war for the UNK of korea before we learned how far our UNK did reach in asia STOP 
START years of war strain and hatred heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to UNK before the united states could bring itself to accept the two chief results of world war 2 communist control of east europe and china a new balance of power STOP 
START UNK the cold war UNK it was easy to blame it all on yalta STOP 
START yet in UNK a series of careful UNK on the yalta conference UNK UNK could find no basis for yalta becoming a symbol for UNK and a UNK for the opponents of roosevelt and international cooperation STOP 
START when the yalta papers were finally published with great UNK they had revealed no UNK by anyone STOP

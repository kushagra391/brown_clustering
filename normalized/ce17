START you can build this vacation cottage yourself STOP 
START it is a full scale small but efficient house that can become a year UNK retreat complete in every detail STOP 
START because of the unique design by the architect UNK UNK you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time STOP 
START most of it is UNK and UNK standard materials and requires the use of only simple tools STOP 
START on the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim STOP 
START in recognition of the growing trend for second homes or vacation UNK we have designed this one specifically with the family UNK in mind STOP 
START it is a big project not to be taken lightly STOP 
START but each step has been broken down into easy stages UNK standard materials and simple tools well within the capabilities of the UNK STOP 
START the theory the idea behind our design is UNK units or UNK STOP 
START everything possible has been UNK to standard sizes and measurements of materials STOP 
START wall panels and structural UNK are standard as are windows and doors making for a minimum of cutting STOP 
START we have developed an UNK method of UNK these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop panel by panel according to plan STOP 
START thus when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor these can be UNK to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend STOP 
START the roof UNK are UNK and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days STOP 
START then you can do the UNK touches at your leisure STOP 
START a warning due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country the first thing to do is to find out what if any they are STOP 
START close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used a remote section there might be no restrictions at all STOP 
START this can usually be found out at the nearest town hall STOP 
START at the same time check the electrical UNK and UNK requirements as well as possible UNK regulations STOP 
START whether electricity and public water and UNK are available or not check the local customs in the use of UNK or UNK gas we give you alternatives later on STOP 
START be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an UNK opinion STOP 
START if there are any major restrictions they usually can be obtained in printed form STOP 
START where a building permit is required find out what you must present when applying for one STOP 
START in many cases you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector STOP 
START these will be available at cost from our plans department STOP 
START the site some general things to look for in a site if you haven't already bought one are UNK water drainage and orientation STOP 
START how are the roads and how will they stand up there evidence of UNK on the property areas or UNK springs visit in the early spring after a UNK will be very UNK STOP 
START note where the sun rises and sets and ask which direction the prevailing winds and UNK come from STOP 
START will the view be something you can live with worry too much about UNK or UNK UNK will take up alternative foundations later on STOP 
START the materials with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic UNK version and the UNK UNK version STOP 
START this will be for the shell of the house only roof walls and floor and does not include the UNK or UNK STOP 
START this will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost STOP 
START bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for UNK fancy UNK UNK and UNK electrical UNK and UNK all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues STOP 
START the wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard af and af of a good grade free from structural UNK STOP 
START they should be as straight as possible as this will effect their ability to UNK properly when the walls are erected STOP 
START the outside surface of the solid units shall be of an UNK grade of panel board such as UNK plastic UNK panel board high density particle board UNK board or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer STOP 
START the inner panels do not have to be UNK and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired STOP 
START all panel board comes in standard af foot size STOP 
START it is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame STOP 
START the fixed window panels with UNK should have a good grade of 1 UNK glass set in a UNK UNK compound STOP 
START the UNK are constructed as shown in the detail with a drop door for UNK STOP 
START there are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them STOP 
START the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of UNK grade STOP 
START the UNK panels for the UNK ends are cut from full af sheets as shown leaving no UNK STOP 
START the battens covering the joints are of af stock and are applied after the walls are erected STOP 
START all nails should be UNK and aluminum is highly recommended STOP 
START note if 1 panel board is used inside and out or 5 one side and 3 the other and 1 glass is used stock lumber in af af and af can be used in making the glass panels STOP 
START other UNK may UNK UNK a special size lumber for the glass trim STOP 
START in any case there is no special milling or UNK required for the panels STOP 
START with modern techniques of UNK and the UNK of cutting tools UNK and UNK available the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool STOP 
START the drill press consists of a vertical shaft UNK which is UNK or UNK on one end to hold a drill chuck a UNK housing UNK in which the UNK is mounted a head in which the UNK is mounted a feed lever which moves the UNK up or down a power source and a movable table upon which the work is placed STOP 
START there is often a means of locking the UNK and on larger UNK the table can be tilted STOP 
START the size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity the maximum diameter tool UNK it will hold or distance between the UNK center and the column STOP 
START a press with an 11 inch capacity UNK you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle STOP 
START a new UNK drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a UNK head that allows UNK to be done at any angle STOP 
START the head is mounted on a UNK arm that UNK on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work STOP 
START UNK and maintenance the drill press should be leveled and depending on whether it is a bench or floor model UNK UNK to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with UNK or expansion UNK STOP 
START this will reduce UNK and increase accuracy STOP 
START a coat of UNK wax or a UNK with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table with a slightly UNK cloth will UNK UNK of the column and UNK STOP 
START UNK not fitted with sealed UNK UNK will need a drop of oil now and then in the UNK holes in the UNK STOP 
START the rest of the press should be kept clean by UNK with a clean UNK or brush STOP 
START be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and UNK STOP 
START belt tension is adjusted by UNK of two locking UNK and a movable motor mount STOP 
START keep the belt just tight enough so the UNK won't slip when pulled by hand tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and UNK UNK STOP 
START most drill UNK have a UNK return spring that raises the UNK automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the UNK in the raised position STOP 
START the return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by UNK the spring housing with a pair of UNK to prevent the spring from UNK when it is released UNK the lock nut or screw and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved STOP 
START turning the housing UNK will reduce tension UNK will increase it STOP 
START don't lose the chuck key STOP 
START UNK manufacturers have had the UNK to provide a UNK for the chuck key you'll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring UNK somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and UNK to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use STOP 
START feeds and speeds drill speeds are important if you want a good job STOP 
START each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed depending on the material worked STOP 
START on most drill UNK it is impossible to get the exact speed but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the UNK UNK STOP 
START you will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction UNK that came with the tool STOP 
START see the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds STOP 
START generally the larger the tool and the harder the material the UNK the speed STOP 
START feed pressure is also of major importance STOP 
START too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and UNK or broken tools STOP 
START too light a feed particularly with metal or other hard material causes UNK of the tool and burning of the cutting edge STOP 
START the best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that UNK the tool cut easily at an even rate STOP 
START common UNK tools there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes STOP 
START the most common are the twist drill the solid center shaft with UNK cutting blades the double spur bit and the power wood bit STOP 
START all will do a good job if sharp but the twist UNK don't cut quite as smoothly as the others since they do not have the UNK UNK that UNK the fibers before actual UNK starts STOP 
START the UNK fly UNK is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut UNK UNK by UNK the UNK blade STOP 
START since fly UNK are one UNK and not balanced they should be used at the UNK speed available and fed very slowly to avoid binding STOP 
START fly UNK can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool so if you want to avoid UNK fingers keep your hands well out of the way STOP 
START simple hole UNK operations when UNK all the way through a UNK always place a piece of UNK wood underneath STOP 
START this will not only protect the work table but also assure a clean UNK STOP 
START another method of UNK a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through then drill half way with the dimensional bit turn the piece over and finish from the other side STOP 
START in soft woods with pronounced grain there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to UNK due to the varying UNK of the wood STOP 
START in this case UNK a small pilot hole or UNK the work will do much to improve accuracy STOP 
START when a hole is to be bored to a UNK depth mark the depth on the side of the stock then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark STOP 
START the depth gauge rod can now be set and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth STOP

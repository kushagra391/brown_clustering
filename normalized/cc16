START a year ago it was UNK that the primary character in UNK maria UNK new novel was based on the UNK UNK de UNK the spanish UNK who died driving in the UNK UNK automobile race of 1957 STOP 
START if this was in fact mr. UNK intention he has achieved a notable failure STOP 
START UNK of heaven has no favorites UNK UNK only in that he is male and a UNK quite a bad UNK whereas UNK was a good one STOP 
START he is a dull UNK and UNK person UNK UNK de UNK was intelligent UNK and passionate STOP 
START one looked forward to mr. UNK ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written UNK on automobile racing as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised STOP 
START UNK heaven has no favorites does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list STOP 
START mr. UNK conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble STOP 
START he proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a UNK between death from UNK and recovery STOP 
START his treatment of it is something else STOP 
START his UNK UNK to die the price of recovery years under the strict UNK of a UNK being higher than she wishes to pay STOP 
START her lover UNK her in death at the wheel and presumably he too has chosen STOP 
START between the first meeting of UNK and UNK and this UNK UNK mr. UNK has laid down many pages of UNK UNK some UNK and rather UNK UNK pleasant talk about some of the UNK and restaurants of europe and a UNK of automobile racing STOP 
START the UNK on life death and the wonder of it all are UNK UNK perhaps because it is pale and UNK when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and UNK is often charming automobile racing bears little relation to reality STOP 
START this latter failure is more than merely bad UNK and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn UNK as say a tournament UNK STOP 
START UNK to life and UNK on the golf course while UNK are UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK on the other hand are quite often killed on the circuit and since it was obviously mr. UNK intention to establish automobile racing as life in UNK one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of UNK and attitudes STOP 
START he does not STOP 
START the jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver and he may indeed have been although i do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature STOP 
START perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal STOP 
START the book carries a UNK in which UNK says it has been necessary for him to take minor UNK with some of the procedures and UNK of racing STOP 
START the necessity is not clear to me and in any case to present a UNK UNK as saying he has left his car which or whom he calls UNK parked on the place UNK UNK at a dozen UNK and UNK parked around him is not a liberty is an UNK STOP 
START but it is in the matter of UNK with death which is the primary concern of the book that UNK failure is UNK STOP 
START UNK is UNK preoccupied and passive STOP 
START to be human he believes is to seek one's own destruction the UNK UNK UNK inevitably cited whenever UNK talk about auto UNK STOP 
START in point of fact the UNK one knows are nearly always intelligent healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live STOP 
START a UNK may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit UNK could say as he did say to me if i die tomorrow still i have had UNK wonderful years i UNK die tomorrow live to be UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK may think of the engine driving his car as a UNK UNK under the UNK STOP 
START the italian master UNK UNK no less sensitive knows twice the UNK though he thinks of a UNK UNK to a wet UNK road at UNK miles an hour as a matter best expressed in UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK driving sees himself a UNK whose cone UNK down to hell UNK UNK UNK one of the greatest UNK of all time believes that UNK UNK driving is an art form related to ballet STOP 
START errors in technical UNK suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr. UNK hoped to tell us STOP 
START however my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the UNK treatment of UNK UNK UNK atomic UNK and all the UNK of our age as brooding UNK or UNK UNK STOP 
START the west is UNK according to this book STOP 
START in contrast the east is UNK led by such UNK heroes as khrushchev UNK and UNK STOP 
START against this UNK determination to UNK the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on UNK and each UNK to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all STOP 
START it is field marshal UNK belief that in most western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity 30 per cent call themselves christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable and only the last 10 per cent are genuine christians and UNK in democracy STOP 
START but these western countries do care about themselves STOP 
START each feels UNK national STOP 
START if say the russians intended to stop tom UNK going to the UNK then tom jones would fight the UNK STOP 
START but he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it such as cause STOP 
START for all practical purposes the west stands UNK UNK and UNK for the tasks of world leadership STOP 
START with this UNK montgomery of UNK UNK his attack upon the UNK of the west STOP 
START never given to UNK words he places heavy blame upon the UNK UNK leadership of britain and particularly america STOP 
START at UNK end leadership in western europe passed from britain because the UNK government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state STOP 
START with britain looking UNK overseas problems were neglected and the UNK was passed on to the united states STOP 
START montgomery believes that she started well STOP 
START america gave UNK in economic aid and military equipment to friend and UNK alike STOP 
START she pushed UNK and UNK nations into prosperity but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace STOP 
START america has divided more than she has united the west STOP 
START the reasons are that america generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars and that she UNK UNK to be liked STOP 
START however she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed STOP 
START but the greater reason for UNK UNK american leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the japanese attacked at UNK harbor STOP 
START they are determined montgomery writes not to be surprised again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary but also creates UNK among other nations in the western alliance not to mention such great UNK among the nations of the eastern UNK that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible STOP 
START the net result is that under american leadership the general world situation has become bad STOP 
START to UNK the american people who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third world war STOP 
START as UNK as has been our leadership clearly the united states must be UNK upon to lead STOP 
START the path to leadership is made clear STOP 
START montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the UNK own house in order STOP 
START such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence STOP 
START this leader must be a man who lives above UNK that UNK have shaped the foreign policy of the united states namely that russia will agree to a UNK germany that the east german government does not exist that events in japan in june 1960 were UNK that the true government of china is in UNK that UNK was the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 and that either china or russia wants or expects war STOP 
START such a leader must strengthen nato politically and establish that true unity about which it has always talked STOP 
START after UNK UNK nato western leadership should turn to reducing the UNK that tear apart the east and west STOP 
START major to this effort is to get all world powers to UNK to their own UNK say by UNK STOP 
START the west should make the central proposal the east would have to show sincerity in carrying it out STOP 
START but where is the leader who will handle all these things for us knew all the national leaders up to the time of kennedy STOP 
START the man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de UNK STOP 
START he alone has the wisdom the conviction the UNK and the courage to reach a decision STOP 
START but de UNK is buried in the cause of UNK UNK lost soul STOP 
START whoever rises to the occasion walks a UNK path to leadership STOP 
START the leader montgomery UNK will need to discipline himself lead a carefully UNK and orderly life allow time for quiet thought and reflection UNK decisions and plans to changing situations be UNK particularly with UNK and be honest and UNK proper STOP 
START all in all montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and UNK the events that UNK him STOP 
START in looking as far back as UNK UNK to cromwell UNK lincoln churchill and UNK montgomery attempts to trace the UNK and qualities of great men STOP 
START he believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was UNK represented by churchill who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for UNK war STOP 
START however montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice STOP 
START most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene STOP 
START like eisenhower he holds the UNK suspicion of politicians STOP 
START however at the same time montgomery UNK as his hero de UNK who is a UNK dominated by political ambitions STOP 
START UNK shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable UNK for giving adequate support STOP 
START for the most part his writing UNK and UNK UNK easy access by the reader to his true thoughts STOP 
START nevertheless montgomery has stated UNK and UNK the crisis of the western world STOP 
START it UNK from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership STOP 
START and it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events STOP 
START it is no common thing for a UNK critical or otherwise to hear a UNK live for the first time only after he has died STOP 
START but then UNK UNK was no common UNK and his whole career public and UNK was UNK with the kind of UNK UNK that terminate with the appearance of his first UNK only when he has ceased to be a living voice STOP 
START it is a kind of justice too that it should UNK in UNK royal albert hall where UNK the UNK if not the greatest performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate UNK victor UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START to be sure UNK made numerous concert UNK here and abroad but these did not take him to new york where the UNK critic might UNK STOP

START another element to concern the UNK is that of the visual devices of the theatre STOP 
START most UNK UNK true to their interest in the UNK of pure movement have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors often black and to give them a bare UNK for a setting STOP 
START but robert UNK the UNK artist has UNK with several of them STOP 
START he has designed a matching UNK and costumes of points of color on white for mr. UNK UNK so that dancers and background UNK into a UNK unity STOP 
START for mr. UNK images and UNK she made some UNK UNK that UNK hide and reveal the UNK and a UNK cape lined with grass STOP 
START mr. UNK has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of UNK and UNK STOP 
START in fact he calls his UNK UNK works of motion shape light and sound STOP 
START to raise the dancer out of his personal UNK self mr. UNK has UNK with relating him to a larger UNK orbit STOP 
START he began with UNK to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be STOP 
START he went on to use objects UNK poles UNK which he employed as UNK of the body of the dancer who moved with them STOP 
START the UNK continued as the dancer was further UNK by the play of lights upon his figure STOP 
START in each case the object the color even the UNK sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the UNK STOP 
START the dancer who never UNK her hold on a UNK begins to feel that it is part of herself STOP 
START or UNK from head to UNK in fabric stretched over a series of UNK the UNK may well lose his sense of self in being a UNK STOP 
START as the dancer is UNK his UNK are UNK and the combined elements give birth to a new being STOP 
START from this being come new movement ideas that UNK dancer and property as a single unit STOP 
START thus the UNK UNK have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition STOP 
START but since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity how are they to UNK the impressive array of materials at their disposal look deliberately to devices used by UNK in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work STOP 
START others less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter and musician STOP 
START an approach that has appealed to some UNK is UNK of charles UNK statement of the process of UNK verse one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception STOP 
START the creator UNK his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it UNK the reality of his experience STOP 
START he UNK external restrictions conventional UNK traditional UNK STOP 
START the unit of form is determined UNK the heart by the way of the breath to the line STOP 
START the test of form is UNK to the experience a gauge also accepted by the abstract UNK painters STOP 
START an earlier but still influential school of painting UNK had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience that event in which seemingly UNK objects are linked together through the curious associations of the UNK STOP 
START the resulting picture might appear a UNK of restless UNK and UNK but it is more true to life than a portrait of an UNK UNK order STOP 
START the contemporary painter tends to UNK not the concrete objects of his experience but their UNK as revealed in UNK of their lines colors masses and energies STOP 
START he is still concerned however with a personal event STOP 
START he UNK the UNK of his UNK because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation STOP 
START the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience STOP 
START some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment with its attendant UNK and UNK than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher more UNK level of truth STOP 
START rather than putting their trust in UNK UNK they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design which UNK an order more real than the UNK of the UNK world STOP 
START the concept remains subjective STOP 
START but in this approach it is the UNK ultimate insight rather than his immediate impressions that gives form to the work STOP 
START others look to more objective devices of order STOP 
START the musician UNK the UNK technique of composition UNK a mathematical system of UNK that once set in motion determines the sequence of UNK and even of rhythms and UNK STOP 
START the composer may reverse or UNK the order of his original set of intervals or rhythms or dynamic changes STOP 
START he may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers STOP 
START but he cannot order his elements by will either rational or inspired STOP 
START the system works as an impersonal mechanism STOP 
START musicians who use the chance method also UNK subjective control of formal development STOP 
START again the composer must select his own materials STOP 
START but a UNK of UNK with perhaps the added UNK of reference to the UNK of the i UNK the chinese book of changes UNK the handling of the chosen materials STOP 
START UNK UNK seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements have turned to similar approaches STOP 
START some let dances take their form from the experience of creation STOP 
START according to UNK UNK the becoming the process of realization is the dance STOP 
START the process UNK that the UNK sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the UNK of the quality that is to follow it STOP 
START the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example a quiet UNK UNK of the body succeeded by a violent leap it may involve more subtle distinctions the UNK may be gradually UNK or UNK its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head STOP 
START even the least UNK will change the quality STOP 
START an exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance STOP 
START the approach to the UNK of the experience of creation may be analytic as it is for miss UNK or spontaneous as it is for UNK UNK STOP 
START she too is concerned with the becoming the process of realization but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of UNK or UNK patterns STOP 
START the design is determined emotionally i must reach into myself for the spring that will send me UNK UNK into the chaos of event with which the dance UNK me STOP 
START looking back miss UNK feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of jackson UNK STOP 
START at one time she felt UNK to make dances that moved all over the stage much as UNK paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas STOP 
START but her conscious need was to break away from UNK patterns of form a need to let the experience shape itself STOP 
START UNK garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling UNK by an initial movement STOP 
START it may be a free UNK swing of the leg leading to a UNK swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground STOP 
START this became a dance called UNK to flight STOP 
START a UNK quality of free UNK and a building from turns close to the ground towards UNK into the air gives the work its central focus STOP 
START UNK UNK objects to art as an UNK of personal emotion STOP 
START he UNK to make his dancers more UNK by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape light color and sound STOP 
START if his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from mars this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world a world in which they are freed of their UNK UNK STOP 
START it is through the UNK dancer that the UNK of form is discovered STOP 
START in his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves and this self in the first revealed stroke of its existence states the theme from which all else must follow STOP 
START the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes UNK STOP 
START it may be a reaction to a UNK sound the following movements UNK further reactions STOP 
START it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color in which case changes in the light or color will set off a UNK of visual designs STOP 
START UNK with the practical function of his actions the dancer is UNK exclusively in their UNK content STOP 
START movements UNK freely because they are UNK by emotional UNK or UNK drive STOP 
START but the UNK must come first STOP 
START though he is also concerned with UNK dance from UNK UNK of activity UNK UNK has selected a very different method for achieving his aim STOP 
START he rejects all UNK UNK continuity any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect STOP 
START he bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything STOP 
START an order can be UNK rather than chosen and this approach produces an experience that is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered STOP 
START thus there is UNK not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well STOP 
START chance he finds UNK him to create a world beyond imagination STOP 
START he UNK with pleasure the comment of a lady who exclaimed after a concert why it's extremely interesting STOP 
START but i would never have thought of it myself STOP 
START the sequence of movements in a UNK dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life STOP 
START at one side of the stage a dancer UNK UNK another UNK UNK while still another is UNK an UNK STOP 
START a man and a girl happen to meet look straight at the audience not at each other STOP 
START he UNK her puts her down and walks off neither pleased nor disturbed as if nothing had happened STOP 
START if one dancer UNK another the victim may do a UNK sit down or offer his UNK a fork and UNK STOP 
START events occur without apparent reason STOP 
START their consequences are irrelevant or there are no consequences at all STOP 
START the sequence is determined by chance and mr. UNK makes use of any one of several chance devices STOP 
START he may UNK UNK may take UNK of paper from a grab bag STOP 
START the answers derived by these means may determine not only the UNK organization of the dance but also its UNK design special UNK UNK the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed STOP 
START the other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance STOP 
START the only factors that are personally set by the UNK are the movements themselves the number of the dancers and the approximate total duration of the dance STOP 
START the approximate is important because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method the result is not UNK STOP 
START each performance may be different STOP 
START if a work is divided into several large UNK a UNK drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the UNK for any particular performance STOP 
START and any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether STOP 
START mr. UNK tries not to UNK the chance method UNK to its UNK as UNK as he can STOP 
START however there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to UNK STOP 
START then the UNK must UNK STOP 
START he must UNK matters so that two performers do not UNK into each other STOP 
START he must construct UNK so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap STOP

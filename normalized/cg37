START fortunately the hole was found at last and UNK STOP 
START another week passed and even the UNK were enjoying the voyage STOP 
START the UNK was gone and after all the two young couples were on their honeymoon STOP 
START the only lasting difficulty was the food STOP 
START in spite of UNK UNK explicit instructions regarding variation of meals the food did not seem the same as at home STOP 
START everything UNK differently from what it does on land and those things i was most fond of at home i UNK the most here ann noted STOP 
START at last they concluded that the heavy full feeling in their UNK was due to lack of exercise STOP 
START walking was the remedy they decided but a deck full of chicken UNK and UNK was hardly suitable STOP 
START UNK was the alternative STOP 
START a rope was found and like children in school the UNK UNK for hours at a time STOP 
START finally UNK of so UNK a form of exercise they decided to dance instead STOP 
START it was much more fun UNK the girls of their old UNK days in the UNK UNK room at UNK STOP 
START the weather turned UNK and with it came better UNK although UNK was still a little UNK STOP 
START she could not face coffee or tea without milk and was always UNK types of food that were not available aboard a sailing ship STOP 
START by now she was sure she was going to have a baby deciding it would be born in india or burma that november STOP 
START she was more excited than frightened at the prospect of having her first child in a foreign land STOP 
START the crew of the UNK never failed to UNK ann who during her stay in salem must frequently have UNK strong UNK language STOP 
START she wrote in her journal i have not heard the least UNK language since i have been on board the vessel STOP 
START this is very UNK STOP 
START she was now enjoying the voyage very much STOP 
START even the first wave of UNK had passed although there were moments when captain heard pointed out on his compass the direction of UNK that she felt a little UNK at her heart STOP 
START as for UNK she found him to be the UNK of husbands STOP 
START on UNK with the permission of captain heard who usually attended with two of his officers services were held in the double cabin STOP 
START sometimes a ship would be UNK and the UNK pass so close that people could easily be seen on the distant deck STOP 
START captain heard did not communicate with any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the united states and britain STOP 
START as UNK temperatures were encountered ann and UNK were introduced to the UNK of bathing daily in salt water STOP 
START when may came the UNK had already crossed the UNK STOP 
START they were sailing round the cape of good hope weather had turned wet and cold STOP 
START at this time UNK wrote in a letter which after their finally landing in india was sent to her mother i care not how soon we reach UNK and are placed in a still room with a bowl of milk and a UNK of indian bread STOP 
START i can hardly think of this simple UNK without UNK oh what a luxury STOP 
START i have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel and the almost UNK smell after the rain that i have done little more than UNK on the bed for several days STOP 
START but i have been UNK with excellent spirits and UNK have been running about the deck and dancing in our room for exercise as well as ever STOP 
START while studying at the UNK in UNK UNK had been working on a new testament translation from the original greek STOP 
START he had brought it along to continue during the voyage STOP 
START there was one particular word that troubled his conscience STOP 
START this was the greek word most often translated as UNK STOP 
START born a UNK he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having a few drops of water UNK on his head yet nowhere in the whole of the new testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized by UNK STOP 
START john the baptist used total UNK in the river UNK for UNK christ was baptized by this method STOP 
START the more UNK looked at the greek word for UNK the more unhappy he became over its true meaning STOP 
START as was only natural he UNK his UNK to ann UNK UNK that it certainly looked as if their own UNK were wrong and the UNK right STOP 
START ann was very troubled STOP 
START by this time she had learned that it was UNK to argue with her young husband yet the uncomfortable fact remained the american UNK were sending them as UNK to the far east and paying their UNK STOP 
START what would happen if UNK changed horses in UNK and UNK in new england were on friendly terms STOP 
START how embarrassing it would be if the newly appointed UNK UNK should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace baptist UNK if you become a baptist i will not ann informed her husband but sweeping her threat aside UNK continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he found himself STOP 
START by early june they were a hundred miles off the coast of UNK by which time all four UNK were hardened UNK STOP 
START even UNK could UNK write i know not how it is i hear the thunder roll the lightning flash the waves threatening to UNK up the vessel yet remain UNK STOP 
START ann UNK to the sight of a delicate UNK and two strange tropical birds STOP 
START land was near and on june 12 one hundred and fourteen days after leaving america they actually saw twenty miles away the coast of UNK STOP 
START captain heard gave orders for the ship to be UNK in the bay of UNK until he could obtain the services of a UNK pilot to UNK her through the shallow waters STOP 
START sometimes ships waited for days for such a man but captain heard was lucky STOP

START a little man with a a dark copper color skin he was wearing UNK UNK and a white cotton short gown STOP 
START ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance STOP 
START he looks as UNK as you can imagine she decided STOP 
START the pilot possessed excellent skill at his calling day long the UNK slowly made her way through the difficult passages STOP 
START UNK to UNK UNK his language while thus employed left much to be desired STOP 
START he swore so loudly at the top of his voice that she didn't get any sleep all the next night STOP 
START next morning the UNK was out of the UNK bay STOP 
START relieved of the major part of his responsibility for the safety of the ship the UNK UNK became fewer STOP 
START slowly she moved up the UNK river a mouth of the mighty UNK toward UNK STOP 
START ann was UNK with the view as were her husband and friends STOP 
START running across the deck which was empty now that the livestock had been killed and eaten they UNK the UNK UNK that came from the shore each pointing out new and exciting UNK to the other STOP 
START out came the journal and in it went UNK own description of the scene on each side of the UNK where we are now sailing are the UNK UNK as thick together as the houses in our UNK STOP 
START they are very small and in the form of UNK without either UNK or windows STOP 
START they are situated in the midst of trees which hang over them and appear truly UNK STOP 
START the grass and fields of rice are perfectly green and UNK of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river and the natives are scattered about differently employed STOP 
START some are fishing some driving the team and many are sitting UNK on the banks of the river STOP 
START the UNK we have passed are much larger than the houses STOP 
START UNK was just as delighted STOP 
START where were the UNK she had expected was certain now that it would be no harder to bear her child here in such pleasant UNK than at home in the big white house in UNK STOP 
START with UNK innocence she wrote of the indians as walking with fruit and UNK in their hands with the UNK children around them STOP 
START this is the most delightful trial i have ever had she decided STOP 
START the indians who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly even if she was UNK shocked according to the customs of the society in which she had been UNK to find them naked except a piece of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle STOP 
START at last they saw UNK largest city of UNK and the UNK UNK STOP 
START founded august 24 UNK by job UNK of the east india company and commonly called the city of UNK it seemed a vast and elegant place to ann UNK UNK STOP 
START solid brick buildings painted UNK white large UNK and tall UNK UNK stretched as far as the eye could see while the UNK and harbor were filled with UNK sailing ships STOP 
START the noise UNK her STOP 
START crowds UNK through the UNK streets UNK loudly in their UNK UNK tongue STOP 
START UNK mouth UNK with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last to her UNK milk and fresh bread STOP 
START ann pleased to see her friend happy was UNK by the new fruits a friend of captain heard had sent on board for their enjoyment STOP 
START UNK she UNK her first UNK and another fruit whose taste she UNK to that of a rich UNK STOP 
START though she did not then know its name this strange new fruit was a UNK STOP 
START six the first act of UNK and samuel on reaching UNK was to report at the police station a necessity when landing in east india company territory STOP 
START on the way they tried to discover all they could about burma and they were disturbed to find that michael UNK book had not presented an altogether true picture STOP 
START he had failed to realize that the UNK were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself STOP 
START they were in fact quietly laughing at him for their king wished to have nothing to do with the western world STOP 
START when captain john UNK of salem had visited burma in UNK his ship the UNK had been promptly UNK and taken by her UNK up the UNK river STOP 
START although after much trouble he did manage to get it back he discovered there was no trade to be had STOP 
START all captain UNK took back to salem were a few items for the town's east india museum STOP 
START a year later another salem ship returned from burma with a UNK of gum UNK which nobody wanted to buy STOP 
START after that salem ships decided to UNK UNK burma STOP 
START the UNK appeared to have little knowledge of british power or any idea of trade STOP 
START they UNK foreigners STOP 
START cruel UNK UNK could on the slightest UNK take a man's life STOP 
START as for UNK even if they succeeded in getting into the country they probably would not be allowed to UNK the christian faith to the UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK or even execution might well be their fate STOP 
START go back to america or any other place UNK friends of captain heard advised them but put thoughts of going to burma out of your heads STOP 
START somewhat UNK the two american UNK reached the police station where they were questioned by a most UNK clerk STOP 
START when he discovered they had received from the company's court of directors no permission to live in india coupled with the fact that they were americans who had been sent to asia to convert the UNK he became more UNK than ever STOP 
START they explained that they desired only to stop in india until a ship traveling on to burma could be found STOP

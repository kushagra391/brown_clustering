START if one characteristic UNK UNK UNK it is the consistency with which every person on the stage including the chorus comes alive in the music STOP 
START much of this UNK quality results from UNK care in UNK his vocal line on natural speech UNK STOP 
START in this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera composers as UNK UNK and UNK with the same goal in mind had developed styles of UNK UNK UNK to their own languages STOP 
START through long experimentation in his songs UNK developed a russian UNK as different from others as the language itself STOP 
START giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra he UNK the speech fall into place as if by coincidence but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words STOP 
START the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and UNK UNK STOP 
START otherwise UNK UNK his vocal UNK for prolonged expressions of emotion UNK first UNK for example STOP 
START even then the flexibility of the UNK suggests that the word comes first in importance STOP 
START aside from UNK himself one need but examine the secondary roles to place UNK among the masters of musical UNK STOP 
START even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision STOP 
START consider the four UNK who figure UNK in the action UNK UNK UNK and the UNK UNK STOP 
START under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other musical setting has an individual touch STOP 
START UNK is an old man weak in body his voice rarely rises to a full UNK but firm and clear of mind STOP 
START his UNK offers contrast to UNK youthful excitement STOP 
START a quiet but sturdy theme somewhat UNK in character appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life this theme comes to represent the outer world the realm of UNK and UNK seen from a distance quite distinct from the UNK spiritual life in the UNK STOP 
START it changes and develops according to the text UNK UNK when he comes before UNK in the last act STOP 
START once he has been identified however a new melody is used to UNK his narrative a UNK UNK with UNK UNK creating a rather ancient effect an imaginative UNK UNK takes on the character he describes as if he were UNK the old UNK blindness and UNK cure STOP 
START here the composer uses a favorite device of his the UNK of the mood through key relationships STOP 
START the original d minor seems to UNK blindness UNK in spite of all attempts to move away from it STOP 
START as the child addresses the UNK in a dream light in the form of the major mode begins to appear and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining d major STOP 
START UNK and UNK always appear together and often sing together in a UNK UNK vigorous UNK that UNK them from the more subtle and UNK UNK STOP 
START their UNK song might easily be a folk melody the same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene STOP 
START apparently their origin is humble their approach to life direct and UNK STOP 
START whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't UNK them now STOP 
START UNK is the straight man not very UNK UNK when he does speak STOP 
START UNK is loud UNK UNK in his UNK and UNK with anyone who is not the same STOP 
START a rough UNK figure heard first in the introduction to the UNK scene UNK him UNK and UNK whenever he comes into the action the song of UNK in which this figure becomes a UNK UNK UNK in the picture of UNK high spirits STOP 
START the UNK is UNK and the abrupt key changes have a primitive UNK STOP 
START we can imagine how they startled audiences of the UNK STOP 
START UNK music begins to UNK as he feels the effects of the wine but he UNK himself together when the need arises STOP 
START both UNK respond to the UNK challenge with a few phrases of their UNK song clever UNK touch is UNK UNK reading of the warrant STOP 
START as the UNK gradually comes back to him his rhythm becomes UNK with the rigid UNK of an UNK reader STOP 
START for the only time in the opera words are not set according to their natural UNK do so would have UNK the dramatic point of the scene STOP 
START UNK and UNK UNK is as far removed from the conventional monk as UNK STOP 
START his music shows a UNK coupled with an UNK quality that suggest somehow a UNK with UNK in UNK UNK STOP 
START his speech shows none of the native UNK of the russian characters spite of the italian name he sounds french STOP 
START his personality appears more striking by contrast with UNK who is perhaps UNK rather UNK characterized STOP 
START UNK first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth in a key totally UNK to what has preceded it STOP 
START the effect is as if he had UNK out of nowhere STOP 
START he speaks quietly UNK his authority beneath a smooth UNK just as the shifting UNK that UNK him all but hide the firm UNK point beneath them STOP 
START he addresses UNK with great UNK calling her UNK at first is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name placing himself by UNK in the position of a UNK father STOP 
START curiously this scene is a close parallel to one that UNK was writing at the same time the scene between UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK and UNK have the same purpose forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's cause and their tactics are much the same STOP 
START UNK begins by describing the sad state of the church brings a reaction of distress from UNK STOP 
START the music becomes UNK as he calls up a vision of her own UNK it is she he tells her who can bring the truth to russia and convert the UNK STOP 
START as if in a UNK she UNK his words then UNK with a shock her own UNK STOP 
START this is no assignment for a UNK girl she UNK him STOP 
START now UNK comes to the point and we hear for the first time a long downward UNK scale that will become the characteristic UNK of his sinister power STOP 
START it is a phrase as UNK as a UNK gesture with a UNK turn of harmony giving an effect of UNK STOP 
START another theme UNK UNK appears as he UNK her to gain power over UNK by any means even at the cost of her honor STOP 
START coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice UNK rebels at this suggestion STOP 
START her pride is as much at stake as her virtue is the UNK beauty the UNK who turns away UNK by the dozen STOP 
START UNK she UNK UNK for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her STOP 
START at once the UNK UNK out all the UNK STOP 
START to music of a UNK darkness he describes the powers of UNK gaining control of the girl UNK her soul with pride and destroying her beauty STOP 
START the combined threat of UNK and UNK is too much for her and she falls UNK at his feet STOP 
START with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and protective UNK her to trust and UNK him as god's spokesman and the UNK scale UNK in ominous contradiction STOP 
START whatever the source of UNK power UNK is his UNK now are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love UNK again throwing a chill over the atmosphere STOP 
START the most unusual feature of UNK however is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus STOP 
START this is the real UNK of the drama conflict is not UNK UNK UNK or UNK or even the ghost of the UNK child but UNK UNK the russian people STOP 
START UNK makes this quite clear by the extent to which UNK scenes UNK the action STOP 
START UNK first entrance seems almost a UNK to the UNK of the UNK scene with its UNK confusion of UNK STOP 
START we have a brief glimpse of the UNK public personality the official UNK but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd a significant contrast with its UNK UNK in the opening scene its bitter resentment and fury in the final act STOP 
START one reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression STOP 
START it rarely speaks as a unit STOP 
START even in its most conventional appearance the UNK song of praise to UNK there are a few female UNK UNK the UNK for her UNK STOP 
START in many passages for example the council of UNK each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion STOP 
START hot arguments arise between UNK and UNK who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea STOP 
START the opening scene shows this method at its most individual STOP 
START UNK UNK a telling picture of the common people those who must suffer the effects of their UNK struggle for power without understanding the causes STOP 
START they are held in control by force but barely STOP 
START they will UNK and UNK for UNK leadership in a UNK intense song its phrases UNK broken as if UNK for breath but when the police with their UNK move away they UNK and UNK and fight among themselves STOP 
START there is a quick change from the UNK song to a UNK tone STOP 
START hey UNK asks one group what are we shouting about UNK apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd UNK that he has no notion STOP 
START the UNK and arguments grow louder until the police return the people strike up their song with even more UNK than before ending it with a UNK of despair STOP 
START UNK frequently uses UNK music with considerable dramatic force STOP 
START in UNK cell the soft prayers of the UNK heard from UNK not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young UNK thoughts and his situation STOP 
START this is especially striking between UNK quiet UNK and UNK UNK UNK against UNK STOP 
START again as UNK feels himself nearing death a UNK files into the hall singing a UNK its UNK UNK adding a UNK touch to the grim atmosphere the words are hardly calculated to put the UNK mind at ease STOP 
START they UNK the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who UNK and UNK for mercy and there is no mercy STOP 
START the living as well as the dead now UNK him final UNK of his guilt is the fatal one STOP 
START one of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the st. UNK scene usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score STOP 
START though brief it has a sharp dramatic edge and great UNK STOP 
START in addition it is an important link in the plot giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward UNK and the false UNK STOP 
START the UNK in the forest of UNK is a natural UNK STOP 
START the st. UNK scene opens with little groups of UNK milling around the square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny STOP 
START in the orchestra we hear first a UNK UNK UNK figure then the UNK police UNK as it appeared in the opening scene STOP 
START the service is over and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman UNK in the lead STOP 
START they bring the news that the UNK has been UNK is met with UNK by the UNK who claim that UNK is lying or drunk STOP 
START UNK UNK contrasts the two groups by their UNK UNK solemn UNK or UNK UNK STOP 
START there is still more news UNK UNK they have prayed for the soul of the UNK STOP

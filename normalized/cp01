START they neither liked nor disliked the old man STOP 
START to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass and at noon and at six each evening its tone UNK UNK never breaking the boredom of the streets STOP 
START the old man was UNK STOP 
START yet if he were not there they would have missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees UNK against the screen door in early june the smell of thick UNK UNK the ripe smell that was both sweet and UNK rising up from aluminum UNK wrapped in UNK UNK STOP 
START or the UNK UNK sounds of UNK at night when their black bodies UNK into the UNK above and below the UNK street lights STOP 
START or the bay of female dogs in heat STOP 
START they never called him by name although he had one STOP 
START UNK UNK that's what he was called in the old country here he was just UNK or the old man STOP 
START but this was not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its UNK STOP 
START youth UNK when commanded STOP 
START it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession STOP 
START but youth asked nothing of its parents not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing STOP 
START the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened STOP 
START but the past was dead here as the present was dead STOP 
START once the old man had had a wife STOP 
START and once she too ignored him STOP 
START with a tiny UNK wrapped around her shoulders she UNK her UNK UNK down the street before him and didn't stop STOP 
START in one hand she UNK a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase STOP 
START the way she UNK down the street the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both STOP 
START without looking at him without looking at anything except UNK street directly in front of her she climbed up into one of those orange UNK rode away in it and never came back STOP 
START but she shouldn't have come here in the first place the women had said STOP 
START no no STOP 
START not that one STOP 
START she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK gave herself fancy UNK because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought she could carry her head higher than ours STOP 
START they had UNK their UNK STOP 
START it's not for making pretty speeches about UNK those UNK get paid so good STOP 
START UNK fingers UNK only by the UNK of polished UNK had UNK UNK beneath UNK UNK where tiny black hairs UNK never to be UNK away STOP 
START UNK UNK that had never known anything UNK than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again STOP 
START UNK if the old man even thought about his wife now nobody cared a UNK STOP 
START it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the UNK UNK of a woman he had consumed watching her become UNK and UNK in the distance as thin as the UNK on her UNK and still UNK STOP 
START his voice had not commanded her to stop STOP 
START it had not questioned why STOP 
START the women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell he might have been UNK away the UNK that UNK from his yellow dog onto him STOP 
START he was never without that dog STOP 
START and his eyes those UNK UNK of UNK yellow had not altered their expression or direction STOP 
START the old man's very soul could have left him and UNK down that street but he wouldn't have had anyone know it STOP 
START perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife STOP 
START but when he called for his UNK wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar seemed to be a UNK purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to UNK street and his back in opposition to the church behind him STOP 
START for all he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the UNK of philadelphia STOP 
START it could have been bari or UNK for the way it smelled STOP 
START what did it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the UNK station into the city's center at UNK intervals that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the UNK place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion in his UNK STOP 
START to him they were one and the same STOP 
START UNK for the old man was framed in by a wall of UNK trees which divided these quarters from the city STOP 
START UNK lined the streets with UNK houses the color of ash STOP 
START it UNK the UNK UNK UNK with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden UNK STOP 
START it UNK with the UNK UNK and UNK with the UNK UNK of screen doors STOP 
START even the UNK which housed nothing now but the UNK of UNK had a lawn before it STOP 
START and the coffee shop on UNK street where the men spent their evenings and UNK playing cards had a rose UNK beneath its window STOP 
START the UNK UNK of coffee UNK thrown against it STOP 
START only one house on the street had no lawn before it STOP 
START it UNK low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron UNK supporting a glass UNK STOP 
START that was UNK shop STOP 
START above it from a UNK UNK wooden angels UNK the neighborhood STOP 
START did the old man remember them there everywhere else UNK was UNK and wood in square blocks like UNK UNK against the UNK of the hill rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery STOP 
START only UNK UNK UNK through the walls of those UNK into the mysterious core of UNK behind the houses where UNK owned no fences where one man's property UNK with the next to form UNK in which no one knew privacy STOP 
START love and hatred and fear were one here UNK only by UNK trees and UNK UNK STOP 
START and the UNK tongue of gossip UNK its sinister way from back porch to back porch STOP 
START the old man silently fed upon these streets STOP 
START they kept him alive waiting STOP 
START waiting for what and for whom only he could tell and would not STOP 
START it was as though he had made a UNK with the devil himself but it was not yet time to pay the price STOP 
START he was holding out for something STOP 
START he was determined to hold out STOP 
START the old man's son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step taking in the UNK of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich STOP 
START at fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother that he couldn't remember her face or her touch did he care that aunt rose provided for him STOP 
START he was named UNK as a tribute to his heritage and he couldn't have cared less about that either STOP 
START to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep STOP 
START when he would be a man he would be a rich man STOP 
START he would not be like the rich americans who lived in UNK houses on the other side of the park STOP 
START he would not ride the UNK local to the city each morning STOP 
START he would not carry a brief case STOP 
START nor would he work at all STOP 
START he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step STOP 
START he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a UNK fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running UNK with her running calling out in her UNK at your service STOP 
START he would order her to bring coffee and would take from his UNK pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff he would not remove his UNK and light and smoke STOP 
START he could do that when he would be a man STOP 
START hey laura called to his sister on the porch above the steps STOP 
START she was only ten months older than he STOP 
START laura what would you say if i UNK a pipe did not answer him STOP 
START she leaned UNK against the broken porch fence UNK and drying her wet UNK hair in the sun STOP 
START one UNK leg UNK the UNK and swung loosely before the UNK torn UNK STOP 
START her UNK foot whose arch swept high and white pointed UNK toward UNK toes toes like fingers whose tips UNK white STOP 
START all the while she sat there her UNK arms UNK before her chest STOP 
START her face showed no sign of having heard UNK STOP 
START it was a face that had lost its UNK UNK and was beginning to UNK within its UNK features a UNK that UNK the lyric lines of its contours STOP 
START the eyes blue and always somewhat UNK possessed a UNK quality STOP 
START even though the boy could not see them he knew they were UNK by distance STOP 
START he was never sure they fully took him in STOP 
START UNK called again laura the only answer that reached him was the UNK of the porch rail from her leg moving against it STOP 
START she's in a mood he thought there's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood STOP 
START well what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one nobody would stop him STOP 
START not even laura STOP 
START suddenly he was interrupted in his UNK by a warm UNK UNK against his chin and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a UNK UNK tongue UNK against the salt taste of him STOP 
START above the tongue an aged yellow eye UNK and UNK UNK within a sphere of UNK pink skin stared UNK at him STOP 
START christ sake UNK UNK the UNK would not STOP 
START you're UNK milk ain't you it with his hand knowing the UNK UNK and the swollen UNK of UNK that wrinkled UNK to his touch STOP 
START UNK rolled over STOP 
START his head UNK gradually covering space to come UNK beneath the UNK belly within the warmth of those UNK STOP 
START with his mouth opened wide he UNK the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue UNK the light UNK taste of it STOP 
START the boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a UNK player pressing and pulling UNK in what he did STOP 
START above him slid the UNK shadow of a storm cloud STOP 
START its form was a heavy figure in a UNK UNK STOP 
START but the boy could see only the UNK belly STOP 
START the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him UNK something UNK in it STOP 
START he knew it was there knew also what it was about but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow UNK back STOP 
START there would be time enough perhaps the old man UNK himself to pay the devil his due STOP 
START time enough to give up his soul STOP 
START in the meantime six UNK stained an UNK the same color as UNK UNK hair UNK up close to him STOP 
START the UNK they made on the concrete interrupted him in the UNK pleasure he knew so that he quickly released his hold on the UNK and UNK to be UNK its UNK for UNK STOP 
START he knew at a glance that the biggest UNK belonged to UNK the UNK ones to UNK and the UNK ones to UNK UNK UNK brother STOP 
START UNK expected UNK small body to sink closer and closer to the ground STOP 
START he expected UNK thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy and her UNK UNK voice to sound against the UNK of his UNK flesh that was never sure of hearing anything STOP

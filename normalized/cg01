START northern liberals are the chief UNK of civil rights and of integration STOP 
START they have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state STOP 
START and both in their objectives of UNK and of social progress they have had ranged against them the southerners who are called UNK STOP 
START the name presumably UNK from the french royal house which never learned and never forgot UNK whiskey though of kentucky origin is at least as much favored by liberals in the north as by UNK in the south STOP 
START the nature of the opposition between liberals and UNK is too little understood in the north STOP 
START the race problem has tended to obscure other less emotional issues which may UNK be even more UNK STOP 
START it is these other differences between north and south other that is than those which concern discrimination or social welfare which i chiefly discuss UNK STOP 
START i write about northern liberals from considerable personal experience STOP 
START a UNK married to a new UNK i have lived for many years in a connecticut UNK town with a high percentage of artists writers publicity men and business UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START most of them are democrats and nearly all consider themselves and are viewed as liberals STOP 
START this is UNK to an UNK conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism because it is clear that these democrats who are UNK are at opposite poles from the liberal jefferson who held that the best government was the least government STOP 
START yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view jefferson as one of their UNK UNK STOP 
START when i question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy i find that they fall into two categories the simpler ones who have simply accepted the UNK of their faith without analysis the intelligent UNK ones who UNK reply that these things don't count any more in the world of UNK STOP 
START i am naive they say to make use of such words STOP 
START i take this to mean that the intelligent and therefore necessarily UNK liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local UNK as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it STOP 
START this seems like an attitude UNK a sort of UNK UNK which under a president of the same UNK would try to UNK an UNK congress or supreme court STOP 
START as for UNK rights they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as UNK of a minor and UNK nature which exist now only as UNK STOP 
START the american liberal may in the world of UNK have a strong case he presents it publicly so UNK in UNK that it is not an honest one STOP 
START why in the first place call himself a liberal if he is against UNK and UNK an UNK central government with UNK controls over everybody he UNK little importance to personal liberty why not make this known to the world if he is so UNK of the rights of states why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more UNK support am concerned here however with the northern UNK attitude toward the south STOP 
START it appears to be one of intense dislike which he makes little effort to UNK even in the presence of southern friends STOP 
START his assumption seems to be that any such friends being UNK UNK must be more liberal than most southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views STOP 
START UNK editor thomas griffith in his book the UNK culture wrote most of what was different about it the deep south i found myself UNK to STOP 
START this for the liberals i know would be an UNK STOP 
START theirs is no mere lack of sympathy but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against UNK STOP 
START i do not think that my experience would be typical for southerners living in the north STOP 
START in business circles usually conservative this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found STOP 
START but in our case and neither my wife nor i have extreme views on integration nor are we given to emotional UNK the situation has ruined one or two valued UNK and come close to UNK several more STOP 
START in fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south because it is not easy for the most objective UNK to sit calmly by when his host is telling a UNK of people that the only way to deal with southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down STOP 
START accounts have been published of northern liberals in the south up against UNK prejudice especially in UNK universities where pressure may be strong to UNK the majority view STOP 
START but these accounts do not show that UNK have been subjected to UNK or UNK by UNK displayed in social UNK STOP 
START from my wife's experience and other sources this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles STOP 
START the strong feeling is certainly there there is a UNK of liberalism among college graduates throughout the south especially among those who studied in the north STOP 
START and social relations arising out of business ties UNK UNK if not sympathy toward resident and visiting UNK STOP 
START also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the UNK southern attitude on most social problems STOP 
START there are of course many UNK for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been UNK and those who haven't STOP 
START my definition of this much UNK UNK is that a UNK rebel is one who is glad that the north won the war STOP 
START nobody knows how many southerners there are in this category STOP 
START i suspect that there are far more UNK ones than the north likes to believe STOP 
START i never heard of a UNK being taken on the question STOP 
START no doubt such a thing would be considered UNK STOP 
START prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerners would have voted against the UNK STOP 
START since the supreme UNK decision of that year this is more doubtful if a UNK had been taken immediately following the UNK of troops to little rock i believe the majority would have been for the old south STOP 
START belief in the traditional way of life UNK much more in the older states than in the new ones STOP 
START probably a larger percentage of UNK and south UNK remain UNK than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and alabama following along after them STOP 
START old attitudes are held more UNK in the UNK than the UNK that a line running down the length of the south marking the upper limits of UNK would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course important minority UNK STOP 
START the UNK areas of states like virginia and south carolina developed the UNK culture to its UNK UNK and there the memory is more precious and the consciousness of loss the greater STOP 
START also we should not even UNK discount the fact that a region such as the UNK UNK UNK on UNK had closer ties with england and the west UNK than with the north even after independence STOP 
START the social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area STOP 
START in certain respects defeat increased the persistent UNK of the old south STOP 
START poor where they had once been rich UNK where they had been UNK having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country STOP 
START and no doubt many people in states like the UNK and georgia which were among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly regretted the UNK against the crown STOP 
START among UNK the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining UNK than other factors STOP 
START all southerners agree that slavery had to go many historians maintain that except for northern UNK it would have ended in states like virginia years before it did STOP 
START southern resentment has been over the method of its ending the invasion and reconstruction fears now are of UNK and negro political control in many counties STOP 
START but apart from racial problems the old UNK south to use the moderate words favored by mr. thomas griffith finds itself UNK to most of what is different about the civilization of the north STOP 
START and this in effect means most of modern america STOP 
START it is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise STOP 
START and UNK i feel many UNK UNK themselves about the south STOP 
START for one thing this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed STOP 
START there seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence UNK it STOP 
START i suppose the reason is a kind of UNK thinking don't talk about the final stages of reconstruction and they will take care of themselves STOP 
START or else the north really believes that all southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past and are now at heart UNK of the american dream like everybody else STOP 
START if the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true STOP 
START the situation of the south since UNK has been unique in the western world STOP 
START regardless of rights and UNK a population and an area appropriate to a UNK 1 great power have been following UNK ruled against their will by a neighboring people and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike STOP 
START and the great majority of these people are of anglo-saxon or UNK descent STOP 
START this is the only case in modern history of a people of UNK origin UNK without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination STOP 
START the fact is due mainly to international wars both hot and cold STOP 
START in every war of the united states since the civil war the south was more UNK than the rest of the country STOP 
START so instead of being tests of the UNK loyalty the spanish war the two world wars and the korean war all served to overcome old UNK and cement reunion STOP 
START and there is no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism STOP 
START had the situation been UNK had for instance england been the enemy in UNK because of issues of concern chiefly to new england there is little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain STOP 
START it is extraordinary that a people as proud and UNK as southerners should have been as UNK as they have STOP 
START the north should thank its stars that such has been the case at the same time it should not draw false UNK UNK STOP 
START the two main charges UNK against the UNK by liberals is that they are UNK and social UNK STOP 
START there is much truth in both these charges and not many UNK deny them STOP 
START whatever their UNK they are not UNK STOP 
START most of them UNK believe that the anglo-saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure STOP 
START many UNK believe this too but few of them will say so publicly STOP 
START the UNK economic philosophy moreover is not very different from that of northern UNK STOP 
START but those among the UNK who remain UNK go much further than this STOP 
START they believe that if the south had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern america STOP 
START as it is they consider that the north is now UNK the fruits of excess UNK that in spite of its high standard of living the american way has been proved UNK to the english and UNK ways although they UNK of the UNK features of the latter STOP 
START the UNK UNK to northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners harsh UNK lack of appreciation of the arts of living like UNK and the use of leisure STOP 
START their own easier UNK UNK is especially dear to southerners i have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up north because they so much prefer the UNK habits of their home town STOP

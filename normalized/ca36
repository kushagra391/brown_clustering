START sen. john l. mcclellan of arkansas and rep. david martin of UNK are again beating the drums to place the unions under the UNK laws STOP 
START once more the UNK equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the UNK laws there must be a corresponding UNK against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally STOP 
START or in the words of UNK france the law in its UNK equality must UNK the rich as well as the poor from UNK in the streets and sleeping under bridges STOP 
START the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the UNK into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr. UNK UNK into corruption in UNK relations and later into the UNK UNK that UNK industrial relations at the missile sites STOP 
START the senator was shocked by UNK over UNK trivial UNK that delayed our missile program STOP 
START in addition UNK that missile workers were UNK sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere UNK his UNK on behalf of the american taxpayer who was UNK the bill STOP 
START it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the UNK strike expenses when the latter UNK to fight a strike STOP 
START business week aug. 9 1961 reports that the united aircraft company against which the international association of UNK had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating STOP 
START the company UNK some UNK million of expenses UNK to four factors advertising to attract new employees UNK and training them extra UNK and UNK work performed by the new workers STOP 
START the company has UNK the united states government for UNK of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the UNK business STOP 
START rep. frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee STOP 
START the committee remains UNK STOP 
START neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter are preoccupied with ending labor UNK by extending the UNK laws to the unions STOP 
START the recent publicity attending the successful federal UNK of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has UNK a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their UNK nor by the results they have obtained STOP 
START the anti-trust laws UNK a business that it must compete but along completely UNK lines must play a game in which there never is a UNK STOP 
START the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law STOP 
START UNK thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy STOP 
START let us look at the UNK industry in which general electric UNK and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of UNK in a conspiracy to UNK prices and UNK the market STOP 
START the industry is so structured that UNK by a UNK company will vary with the way overhead charges are UNK whether marginal or average UNK is applied STOP 
START the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment STOP 
START accounting procedures can be varied to provide a UNK for almost any price STOP 
START naturally enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small UNK can be forced to the wall in a very short time STOP 
START should these giants really UNK their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry STOP 
START uncle sam would then UNK them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition STOP 
START but if they show UNK they don't get the orders STOP 
START under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted STOP 
START UNK in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants STOP 
START the UNK implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a UNK consent UNK that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows STOP 
START in other words the anti-trust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday STOP 
START and which theory would UNK the UNK of the law on sunday question might be asked don't the UNK of the UNK manufacturers know these facts did they engage in a flood of UNK UNK throw a few UNK to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by UNK arnold in the folklore of capitalism back in UNK STOP 
START he wrote p. UNK the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which UNK felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure STOP 
START p. UNK anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to UNK business dictatorship STOP 
START p. UNK when corporate UNK were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal UNK would be UNK rather than control STOP 
START in this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws STOP 
START UNK UNK in any event it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial UNK the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government STOP 
START this escape from control has led to UNK UNK the risk of occasional UNK UNK as worth while STOP 
START a plea of UNK UNK followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this UNK license STOP 
START the UNK handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in anti-trust UNK perhaps because the UNK had displayed unusual UNK in their UNK activities STOP 
START if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a UNK impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest STOP 
START a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle STOP 
START however one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one UNK that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational STOP 
START quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union STOP 
START those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are UNK a brand new reform STOP 
START before UNK individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english STOP 
START the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in UNK implicit in the writing of section UNK of the national industrial recovery act has made it UNK to oppose collective bargaining in principle STOP 
START the wagner act the UNK act and the UNK act all UNK the principle of collective bargaining STOP 
START the basic purpose of an effective UNK system is the removal of wages from competition STOP 
START if a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being UNK off by UNK as a UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession STOP 
START the problem must be faced squarely STOP 
START if UNK are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many UNK of UNK and corn UNK by the way by any agricultural UNK then they may be UNK for UNK with complete UNK to a system that UNK such status upon them STOP 
START human labor was exactly that a UNK in UNK and nineteenth-century america STOP 
START as early as UNK adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations we have no acts of parliament against UNK to lower the price of work many against UNK to raise it STOP 
START UNK england upon whose customs our common law was built had UNK unions as UNK and UNK STOP 
START in UNK the boston house UNK strike for a UNK day was UNK by the organized employers who declared it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into UNK STOP 
START there were no UNK UNK then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly STOP 
START the courts shared the opinion of the employers STOP 
START in people vs. UNK justice savage of the new york supreme court declared without any UNK and UNK interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be UNK by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it the right does not exist to raise the wages of the UNK by any forced and artificial means STOP 
START compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin according to the daily labor report of sept. 19 1961 UNK the necessity of UNK anti-trust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent UNK fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment STOP 
START senator mcclellan is UNK the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation STOP 
START his bill UNK aimed at UNK would UNK the sherman clayton and UNK acts to UNK the UNK of federal UNK in any transportation strike and would make it UNK for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international STOP 
START paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation the civil UNK board was UNK the UNK that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act STOP 
START indeed it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers UNK from the anti-trust laws example the organization of UNK conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek UNK STOP 
START at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the UNK of anti-trust legislation a drive is on to UNK collective bargaining under the UNK of extending the UNK laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates STOP 
START the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant UNK STOP 
START it was most effective against trade unions STOP 
START in the famous UNK UNK case a suit was brought against the union by the UNK company for UNK practices e.g. trying to persuade UNK not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer STOP 
START the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment STOP 
START in UNK the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a UNK STOP 
START the law could not UNK economics STOP 
START labor remained a UNK but presumably a UNK one granted UNK from the anti-trust laws STOP 
START the courts by interpretation UNK the act STOP 
START in UNK the united mine workers struck the UNK coal company STOP 
START the company UNK under the anti-trust laws UNK that the UNK activity UNK with the movement of interstate commerce STOP 
START what other purpose could a striking union have but to UNK the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce STOP

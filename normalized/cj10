START apart from the UNK practically all bees and UNK UNK in a state of UNK STOP 
START occasionally you may come across one or two UNK in the cold season when you are turning over UNK in your garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see them at all STOP 
START they keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their bodies and in spite of their often colorful UNK you may very well mistake them for UNK of dirt STOP 
START i must add at once that these animals are what we call UNK young females that have UNK in the previous summer or autumn STOP 
START it is on them alone that the future of their race depends for all their relatives mothers husbands brothers and UNK sisters have UNK with the arrival of the cold weather STOP 
START even some of the UNK will die before the winter is over falling UNK to enemies or disease STOP 
START the survivors emerge on some nice sunny day in march or april when the temperature is close to UNK and there is not too much wind STOP 
START now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful UNK UNK such as the red UNK UNK of our pacific northwest or otherwise a good UNK tree or perhaps some nice UNK UNK in bloom preferably one with male or UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK of UNK and of the UNK and UNK are the places where large numbers of our early insects will UNK UNK UNK and other wild bees and also various kinds of flies STOP 
START it is a happy UNK crowd STOP 
START each male UNK UNK is composed of a large number of small flowers STOP 
START it is not difficult to see that the UNK of the UNK are always arranged in pairs and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green UNK little scale STOP 
START by UNK the flowers one can also notice that the scale bears one or two tiny UNK STOP 
START those are the UNK or honey UNK fig. 26 page UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK then provide their visitors with both UNK and pollen marvelous arrangement for it provides exactly what the bee UNK need to make their UNK a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed STOP 
START the only exception to this is certain bees that have become UNK STOP 
START i will deal with these later on STOP 
START quite often UNK form a majority on the UNK UNK STOP 
START as we have already seen in the first chapter UNK are bigger UNK and much more colorful than UNK UNK various combinations of black yellow white and orange STOP 
START let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game and let us just call them UNK STOP 
START there must be several dozen species in the united states alone STOP 
START if you really insist on knowing their names an excellent book on the north american species is UNK and their ways by o. e. UNK STOP 
START if we manage to keep track of a UNK queen after she has left her feeding place we may discover the UNK little UNK which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter sleep STOP 
START as UNK a queen a UNK female is rather UNK and may spend considerable time searching for a suitable UNK place STOP 
START most species seem to prefer a UNK hollow such as a deserted UNK nest a bird house or the hole made by a UNK show a definite liking for making their nest in UNK STOP 
START once she has made up her mind the queen starts out by UNK in her chosen UNK a small floor of dried grass or some UNK material STOP 
START on this she UNK an egg compartment or egg cell which is filled with that famous UNK mixture called UNK STOP 
START she also UNK one or two UNK cups which she UNK with honey STOP 
START then a group of eggs is UNK in a cavity in the UNK UNK and the egg compartment is closed STOP 
START the queen afterward keeps UNK and UNK her eggs like a mother hen taking a UNK from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey UNK STOP 
START when the UNK UNK they feed on the UNK although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother STOP 
START she continues to add to the pollen supply as needed STOP 
START the UNK kept warm by the queen are full grown in about ten days STOP 
START each now makes a tough UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START after another two weeks the first young emerge four to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees collecting pollen and UNK in the field and UNK for the new young generation while the queen UNK to a life of egg laying STOP 
START the first worker bees do not mate or lay eggs and UNK females do not emerge until later in the season STOP 
START the UNK of workers that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones probably because they are better fed STOP 
START by the middle of the summer many of the UNK apparently receive such a good diet that it is optimal and it is then that young UNK begin to appear STOP 
START simultaneously males or UNK are produced mostly from the UNK eggs of workers although a few may be produced by the queen STOP 
START the young UNK and UNK leave the nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the UNK young UNK will begin to UNK in for the winter STOP 
START it is an amazing fact that in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full swing for instance in august STOP 
START the temperature then is still very high STOP 
START at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lay the UNK eggs that will produce females STOP 
START as a result the proportion of males which leave the nest increases and eventually the old colony will die out completely STOP 
START the nest itself the structure that in some cases housed about UNK individuals when the season was at its peak is now rapidly destroyed by the UNK UNK of certain UNK and UNK STOP 
START not always though does the development of a UNK colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described STOP 
START some members of the bee family have become UNK social UNK that live at the expense of their UNK relatives STOP 
START UNK can thus suffer severely from the UNK of UNK the UNK as it is called in some european countries STOP 
START female individuals of UNK look UNK like the workers and UNK of the UNK they UNK STOP 
START the one sure way to tell victim and UNK apart is to examine the UNK legs which in the case of the UNK UNK lack the pollen UNK naturally female UNK UNK much time in her efforts to find a nest of her host STOP 
START when she UNK she usually UNK to slip in UNK to UNK an egg on a completed UNK of UNK before the UNK seal the egg compartment STOP 
START the UNK never seem to recognize that something is UNK so that the compartment afterward is sealed normally STOP 
START thus the UNK of the UNK can develop at the expense of the UNK inhabitants and the store of UNK STOP 
START later on they and the mother UNK are fed by the UNK workers STOP 
START worse still in a number of cases it has been claimed that the UNK female UNK the UNK queen STOP 
START but let us return after this UNK UNK to our UNK UNK in the spring are other wild bees that command our attention STOP 
START it is almost certain that some of these usually a UNK smaller than the UNK are UNK or mining bees STOP 
START there are about 200 different kinds of UNK in europe alone STOP 
START one of my favorites is a. UNK a species very common in england where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn bee STOP 
START the females like to UNK in the short UNK of UNK UNK where their little UNK of earth often appear by the hundreds STOP 
START almost equal in size to a UNK a. UNK is much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species a rich UNK UNK red STOP 
START the males are much UNK STOP 
START after having UNK an UNK female UNK a hole straight down into the ground forming a UNK about the size of a lead pencil STOP 
START the bottom part of a UNK has a number of side UNK or cells each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of UNK STOP 
START the development of the UNK UNK is very rapid so that by the end of spring they have already UNK and become adults STOP 
START but they are still enclosed in their UNK cells and remain there throughout the summer fall and winter STOP 
START their appearance next spring UNK in an almost UNK way with the UNK of their host plants STOP 
START in the UNK valley in california for instance it has been observed that there was not one day's difference between the UNK of the UNK and the opening of the UNK UNK STOP 
START this must be due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and the animal STOP 
START after the male and female UNK have UNK the cycle is repeated STOP 
START although UNK is UNK so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of UNK together we must still call it a solitary bee STOP 
START its life history is much simpler than that of the truly colonial UNK and can serve as an example of the life cycle of many other species STOP 
START after all social life in the group of the bees is by no means general although it certainly is a striking feature STOP 
START on the basis of its life history we like to think that UNK is more primitive than the UNK STOP 
START the way in which it UNK its pollen is not so perfect either STOP 
START it UNK pollen UNK and UNK only a large number of long UNK hairs on its legs on which the pollen grains will collect STOP 
START still UNK will do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load looks like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind STOP 
START closely related to the UNK are the UNK or UNK bees STOP 
START UNK UNK can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of the united states west of the great plains for example in UNK and central washington STOP 
START in the united states department of UNK UNK of agriculture 1952 which is devoted entirely to insects george e. UNK UNK a site in UNK which was estimated to contain UNK UNK females STOP 
START often the UNK are only an inch or two apart and the bee cities cover several acres STOP 
START the life history of the UNK bee is similar to that of UNK but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer and the individuals UNK in the UNK stage STOP 
START in most places there are two generations a year a second UNK of adults appearing late in the summer STOP 
START i must UNK guilty to a special sympathy for UNK STOP 
START this may just be pride in my adopted state of washington but certainly i love to visit their mound cities near UNK and UNK in july or august when the bees are in their most active period STOP 
START the name UNK bee indicates that one has to look for them in rather UNK places STOP 
START sometimes although by no means always these are indeed UNK STOP 
START the thing is that these bees love a UNK soil that is moist the water in the ground should not be UNK either STOP 
START they dislike UNK UNK STOP 
START where does one find such conditions best chance of course is offered by gently UNK UNK where the water remains close to the surface and where the air is dry so that a high UNK leaves UNK UNK which permit only UNK plant growth STOP

START the popularity of folklore in america stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america STOP 
START and the emphasis on nationalism in america is in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world STOP 
START thus if we are to observe american folklore in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore nationalism and UNK at the outset STOP 
START historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence STOP 
START 1 every age UNK the events of its history in terms of what should have been creating UNK about itself that UNK contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions STOP 
START what actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred STOP 
START 2 as a country UNK its cultural and political attitudes on others it UNK its heritage in hopes of UNK its UNK STOP 
START its folklore and legend usually disguised as history are allowed to account for group actions to provide a UNK point for group loyalty and to become a cohesive force for national identification STOP 
START one can apply these facts to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her UNK over palm and pine and they can be applied again to the united states in more recent years STOP 
START the popularity of local color literature before the UNK war the steady currency of the lincoln myth the increased emphasis on the frontier west in our mass media are cases in point STOP 
START nor is it an accident that baseball growing into the national game in the last 75 years has become a UNK of american life that learned societies such as the american folklore society and the american historical association were founded in the UNK or that courses in american literature american civilization american anything have swept our school and college UNK STOP 
START of course nationalism has really UNK its usefulness in a country as UNK as ours and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture UNK of the UNK united states STOP 
START yet nationalism has lost few of its UNK for the historian writer or man in the street STOP 
START it is an understandable UNK that most american history and most american literature is today written from an essentially UNK and UNK point of view at the very time america is spreading her UNK over palm and pine STOP 
START after all the average american as he lies and UNK for the enemy in korea or as she UNK the newspaper in some UNK hope of personal contact with the front is UNK that his or her UNK is the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal UNK UNK and control STOP 
START UNK identification with an international struggle whether UNK or peaceful requires absurd UNK and intense emotional involvement STOP 
START such identification comes for each group in each crisis by UNK history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes STOP 
START in america such UNK has served a particularly useful purpose STOP 
START a UNK people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political UNK in a new and UNK land STOP 
START but we must never forget most of the appropriate heroes and their UNK were created overnight to answer immediate needs almost always with conscious aims and ends STOP 
START UNK UNK george washington became the symbol of UNK and the father image of the UNK states STOP 
START UNK lincoln emerged as an UNK of the national constitution STOP 
START robert e. lee represented the dignity needed by a UNK UNK STOP 
START and their roles are UNK by those of UNK henry UNK UNK andrew jackson UNK UNK theodore roosevelt and many many more STOP 
START therefore the scholar as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years will be UNK of two facts STOP 
START 1 most of the UNK that are created to fan the fires of UNK are essentially UNK and are not folk UNK at all STOP 
START 2 the concept that an american national folklore exists is itself probably another UNK legend STOP 
START folklore is individually created art that a UNK group of people preserve vary and UNK through oral transmission STOP 
START it has come to mean UNK UNK tales songs UNK UNK UNK UNK and such literary forms of expression STOP 
START related to written literature and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form it loses its vitality when UNK or removed from its oral existence STOP 
START though it may exist in either UNK or UNK societies it UNK a role of true cultural importance only in the latter STOP 
START in its UNK and commercial UNK to discover our folk heritage the public has remained ignorant of UNK such as this STOP 
START UNK americans have swept UNK and UNK materials like paul UNK tales UNK lincoln UNK and labor union songs up as true products of our american oral tradition STOP 
START nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of america the hundreds of isolated and UNK ethnic regional and occupational groups did not UNK into a UNK national unit until long after education and UNK had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying UNK significant material STOP 
START naturally such UNK facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan UNK by means of folklore STOP 
START that much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully UNK among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant STOP 
START as long as his material is UNK can in some way be UNK to the masses and appears democratic to his audience he remains satisfied STOP 
START from all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of UNK american folklore STOP 
START on the one side we have the university professors and their students trained in UNK methods of research who have sought out collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic regional and occupational groups that make up this nation STOP 
START on the other we have the UNK and the national UNK who have been willing to use any UNK frontier western or colonial material UNK STOP 
START unfortunately few of the artists writers movie producers UNK and musicians who have used american folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways STOP 
START after all the field is large difficult to define and seldom taught properly to american UNK STOP 
START in addition this country has been settled by many peoples of many UNK and their UNK has become UNK slowly in an age of print and easy communication within an UNK and changing society STOP 
START the problems UNK even the experts STOP 
START for that matter the experts themselves are a mixed breed STOP 
START UNK UNK historians and such by profession they approach their discipline as UNK UNK commercial UNK UNK or some combination of the four STOP 
START they have widely varying UNK and aims STOP 
START they have little UNK de corps STOP 
START the outlook for the amateur for instance is usually dependent on his UNK for local history or for the UNK STOP 
START his love of folklore has UNK in it and he doesn't care much about the UNK or the UNK STOP 
START folklore is his UNK and he all too UNK wishes it to remain as such STOP 
START the amateur is closely related to the UNK who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field STOP 
START the UNK UNK the contact with rural life UNK folklore for the very field and stream reasons that many persons UNK game only rarely is he UNK concerned with the meaning of what he has located STOP 
START UNK both these types the amateur and the UNK are UNK and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and UNK material STOP 
START but there are also the commercial UNK and the UNK one dominated by money the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship STOP 
START both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the UNK has found STOP 
START both UNK at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines STOP 
START the commercial UNK who can't afford to be critical gets along well with the amateur from whom he feeds but he frequently steps on the UNK toes by UNK to keep his material genuine STOP 
START his standards are of course completely foreign to those of the UNK STOP 
START to both the amateur and the commercial UNK the UNK UNK a soul UNK appreciation with his endless UNK and UNK STOP 
START dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system the UNK looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups although he cannot deny his debt to the UNK STOP 
START the knowledge that most americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial UNK and a few energetic UNK and UNK STOP 
START the work done by the UNK the men who really know what folklore is all about has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited learned audience STOP 
START publishers want books that will sell recording UNK want UNK that will not seem strange to ears used to UNK and jazz music grade and high schools want quaint but moral material STOP 
START the UNK is apt to be too honest to fit in STOP 
START as a result most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is see it as a UNK of charming moral UNK and UNK UNK with a UNK or remedy thrown in here and there STOP 
START and so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the UNK that even at the college level most of the UNK folklore courses given in the united states survive on sentiment and nationalism alone STOP 
START if one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant american public STOP 
START and while every writer must be dealt with as a special case the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each STOP 
START does the writer know the difference between an UNK UNK or tall tale and a true product of the folk the writer uses material does he UNK with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure the writer UNK he swept away by sentiment and UNK for an america that was does he UNK want to tap the real springs of american attitude and culture regardless of how UNK and embarrassing they may be he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged STOP 
START in the first place a good many writers who are said to use folklore do not unless one counts an occasional UNK or tale STOP 
START robert UNK for instance writes about rural life in new england but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems STOP 
START this has not however prevented publishers from UNK him a folk poet simply because he is a rural one STOP 
START in the second place a large number of writers making a more direct claim than UNK to being folk writers of one sort or another clearly make no distinctions between genuine and UNK material STOP 
START stephen vincent UNK john brown's body comes immediately to mind in this connection as does john UNK the UNK of UNK and carl UNK the people yes STOP 
START the last two writers introduce strong political UNK into their works and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon see folklore as a UNK of protest by a UNK and UNK UNK mass STOP 
START folklore as used by such writers really reflects images UNK into it by the very person using it STOP 
START the folk are simply not UNK with respect to nation or political attitude STOP 
START in fact there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional ethnic and occupational limits STOP 
START nevertheless with a reading public that UNK for the good old days and with an awareness of our expanding international interests it is easy for the UNK to obtain a UNK position in literature by use of all sorts of UNK real or UNK and it is easy for the UNK and UNK to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk STOP

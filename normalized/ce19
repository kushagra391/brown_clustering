START it is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool eight UNK vigorous UNK not wholly UNK years STOP 
START we have learned a lot a dash of UNK here a bit about UNK and UNK there STOP 
START we have had sound UNK in the principles of the UNK school of diplomacy STOP 
START we have become amateur insurance experts and UNK yard birds STOP 
START true our problems have UNK a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools thereby UNK our spectacular UNK STOP 
START but problems UNK to pools as any pool owner knows STOP 
START so our UNK UNK of spirit UNK us to share our trials errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool UNK for the first time in the UNK hope that some may profit from our experience STOP 
START where to put it position may not be everything but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties social and physical STOP 
START we speak from varying UNK STOP 
START one of us has a pool set in a UNK area very near the house STOP 
START the other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill STOP 
START if you are dreaming of a blue UNK pool right outside your living room windows close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children damp towels UNK tubes of UNK oil and UNK plastic toys STOP 
START you are likely to be nearer the truth STOP 
START you can also see that the greater the UNK of the pool to your main living quarters the greater the chance for violation of family privacy UNK noise and the UNK attitude STOP 
START on the other hand UNK does not lead to UNK when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long UNK to reach the pool STOP 
START another dilemma as UNK as a UNK pond in the forest may be trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the UNK of a pool STOP 
START yet a UNK approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is UNK STOP 
START as in choosing a wife it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good STOP 
START in the UNK UNK for instance you will have to live through the many UNK winter months when your pool will hardly look its best STOP 
START it may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay or an ice UNK UNK with UNK STOP 
START even a neat UNK UNK is not exactly a joy to UNK STOP 
START we do however recommend those UNK covers to prevent both people and UNK UNK and UNK generally from UNK UNK in the pool STOP 
START probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts STOP 
START naturally it will be UNK to a large extent by the shape and size of your land STOP 
START but if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day it is certainly more UNK to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate UNK of the house STOP 
START and a good several feet around the pool should be neither UNK nor woods but good hard pavement STOP 
START the placement of your pool however will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool UNK those that involve your social life and those UNK to safety STOP 
START UNK with them demands stern discipline of yourself as well as of your family neighbors friends and anyone you ever talked to on a UNK jet STOP 
START eight years ago while we were going through the UNK construction period we were each UNK by the vision of early morning UNK and evening UNK to a cool family collected around the pool with a UNK table laid out nearby for the lord and UNK UNK STOP 
START but not even our first UNK UNK came anywhere near those UNK UNK STOP 
START we seemed to be UNK the population explosion right in our own UNK STOP 
START our respective families looked as if they had UNK STOP 
START had we taken a UNK on a state park at all STOP 
START we had merely been discovered by the pool UNK STOP 
START we were in business proud UNK to UNK UNK and UNK was a short step no more than the change from city clothes to UNK STOP 
START naive of us maybe but the results of our UNK invitations to come over next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and UNK STOP 
START our book of UNK after the first few weeks it was obvious that rules had to be made laid down and UNK even if our popularity UNK became UNK as a result STOP 
START so rules we made in UNK UNK STOP 
START since our UNK in this respect UNK precisely we present the fruits of our efforts UNK as a single social code for pool owners STOP 
START first and foremost no one no not anyone in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle STOP 
START just short of forty UNK we finally managed to UNK our children to this view STOP 
START their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool but on our terms and at our times STOP 
START no friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least UNK UNK STOP 
START no UNK either even if they are UNK legitimate UNK STOP 
START we want to know when the UNK telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring so that we won't end up with a UNK UNK that looks like UNK island in august STOP 
START no young children may come without adults except for a specific organized UNK party STOP 
START and accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities STOP 
START a UNK of UNK mothers backs to the pool is no UNK STOP 
START no bottle pool is UNK bottle pool being our UNK for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while UNK that they can only UNK and run STOP 
START UNK UNK and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we UNK became the neighborhood UNK stop STOP 
START we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours STOP 
START this has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less UNK to the young less fortunate than ours STOP 
START we also worked out UNK for sunday afternoon UNK who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an UNK lunch UNK UNK STOP 
START we gently UNK them to an island of tables and chairs UNK placed on the far side of the pool where they can UNK each other until we get ready to UNK sides STOP 
START all dressing UNK to be more exact must be done in our small bath house or at the UNK homes STOP 
START to avoid any possible excuse for a UNK parade through your house it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool and the parking area STOP 
START we do however provide a limited number of extra suits mainly for children and we stock extra towels and a few UNK bathing UNK STOP 
START UNK the UNK UNK kind are held in readiness too for the very young STOP 
START UNK life and UNK safety rules of course are more important than all the others put together STOP 
START in many UNK now the law requires all pools to be UNK usually to a minimum height of 5 feet STOP 
START but UNK or UNK no UNK is the place for running or UNK STOP 
START we allow no underwater endurance UNK either or UNK UNK of water UNK STOP 
START UNK boards must have UNK surfaces UNK UNK takes an awful beating from chlorine and UNK quickly but UNK UNK are excellent STOP 
START and UNK must be UNK to look before they leap either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge STOP 
START our pools also have wide shallow steps for the benefit of the UNK UNK who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder UNK STOP 
START all bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are UNK in favor of plastic or metal cups STOP 
START when you first acquire a pool we earnestly recommend for your own mental health a good long UNK with your insurance agent STOP 
START you should be prepared to cope with any UNK such as UNK into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer UNK STOP 
START UNK pools UNK do not just happen STOP 
START they are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements STOP 
START unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your UNK UNK purity its care and feeding from UNK content to UNK and UNK is best left to a weekly or UNK professional service STOP 
START of course if your pool is close to the house your wife can always add it to her UNK chores you hope STOP 
START or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers STOP 
START even so every pool owner in case of emergency should have some idea of what makes things work STOP 
START a brief course in UNK from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis STOP 
START UNK the pool a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool UNK green overnight STOP 
START you need more chlorine STOP 
START the walls feel UNK STOP 
START you need UNK STOP 
START with or without professional help you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse STOP 
START you should see to it that the trap the UNK in front of the UNK is always clean STOP 
START a pool is no place for a shut trap STOP 
START you should firmly insist that no bobby UNK or hair UNK be worn in the water STOP 
START when shed they leave UNK marks STOP 
START you can hope against hope that come spring cleaning your UNK friends will lend a hand at UNK and UNK STOP 
START it has happened STOP 
START many hours of spring cleaning will be saved however if you remove the main drain UNK when you close the pool season in the fall STOP 
START as the pool is UNK stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet STOP 
START much of the dirt and leaf UNK is easily removed when damp but requires UNK if allowed to dry STOP 
START if you have a UNK to UNK drain pipe you may easily wash out all the UNK when the UNK is out STOP 
START of course when your UNK UNK of water is released it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties STOP 
START do not forget this possibility STOP 
START if your pool is located on or near UNK ground it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first UNK out the water and then UNK out all the UNK STOP 
START it may be true that pool lighting UNK an evening scene but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around STOP 
START once on the water these little visitors seldom leave and this UNK to your UNK and UNK problems as well as providing a UNK good time for all those present STOP 
START often one UNK high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense STOP 
START our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible from UNK to UNK STOP 
START follow UNK instructions to the letter and be sure that one person in the family or not is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job with no chance for claiming it wasn't my turn STOP 
START never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the UNK even if the little boys do want to play space ship STOP 
START you may find yourself hitting bottom literally as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in STOP

START the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be UNK STOP 
START for men who had left cattle alone after getting their first UNK had received no second STOP 
START but the day of the UNK came and passed and the men who had UNK at the UNK laughed with satisfaction STOP 
START for with a single exception nothing had happened to them STOP 
START the exception was an iron mountain UNK named william lewis STOP 
START after walking out to his UNK that morning he'd been amazed to see the dust UNK up in front of his feet STOP 
START a split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded STOP 
START he'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come STOP 
START but he had found all of the UNK and points of cover deserted STOP 
START there had been no sign of a UNK and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near STOP 
START lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow UNK STOP 
START he hadn't even UNK to be farming his spread STOP 
START his land had never been UNK STOP 
START he had done his UNK openly and UNK about it STOP 
START he had received both first and second anonymous UNK and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them STOP 
START he had cursed at them and threatened them STOP 
START he was a man those neighbors testified later who didn't have a friend in the world STOP 
START william lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet and once more he accused and threatened everyone STOP 
START i'll be ready next time UNK STOP 
START i'll be UNK right back STOP 
START he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happened again STOP 
START this time lewis had his own rifle in his hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious UNK shot then spent most of the day searching out the area STOP 
START he found nothing but he still refused to give up and move out STOP 
START just let me meet up with that damned UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START that's all i ask never got that chance STOP 
START for the UNK UNK UNK aimed a little higher the third time STOP 
START a bullet smashed directly into the center of william UNK chest STOP 
START he UNK against a log fence rail then tried to lift himself STOP 
START two more shots followed in quick succession dropping him limp and UNK on the ground STOP 
START an UNK was held and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county UNK estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards STOP 
START UNK of the offer tom horn had made at the UNK association meeting had UNK out by then and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got UNK the UNK attorney a colonel UNK ordered that the tall stock detective be UNK for questioning STOP 
START it took some time to locate horn STOP 
START he was finally found in the UNK hole region of UNK county two counties away STOP 
START UNK UNK immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment STOP 
START but that indictment was never made STOP 
START for tom horn it turned out had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to UNK with straight faces that he had been in UNK hole the day of the killing STOP 
START the former UNK UNK couldn't be shaken STOP 
START the authorities had to release him STOP 
START he immediately rode on to UNK threw a UNK drinking UNK and dropped some very strong UNK among friends STOP 
START dead center at three hundred yards that UNK said grin STOP 
START three shots in that UNK UNK he hit the ground UNK there's two men in this state can shoot like that he denied everything STOP 
START privately he created and UNK an image of himself as a hired UNK STOP 
START for a UNK ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do STOP 
START tom horn was soon back at work giving his secret employers their UNK worth STOP 
START a good many UNK settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats STOP 
START the company UNK were being UNK less often and UNK and UNK all over the range were standing deserted STOP 
START but there were other UNK who passed the lewis murder off as a personal UNK killing the work of one of his neighbors STOP 
START the UNK problem was by no means solved STOP 
START even in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still UNK STOP 
START for less than a dozen miles from the UNK land of the dead man lived another UNK who had ignored the UNK that his existence might be UNK on a UNK and UNK UNK named fred powell STOP 
START fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle his own hired man andy ross mentioned later STOP 
START everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it even after them notes came even after he'd heard about lewis even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times UNK the morning of september 10 UNK powell and ross rose at dawn and began their day's work STOP 
START UNK time was close at hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay UNK STOP 
START UNK a team to a UNK they drove out to a UNK creek about a UNK off then climbed down and began UNK STOP 
START andy ross had just started swinging an UNK at his second UNK when the distant blast of a rifle sounded STOP 
START he looked around in surprise then noticed that fred powell was UNK his chest STOP 
START the hired man ran over to help his boss STOP 
START my god i'm shot UNK STOP 
START and he collapsed and died instantly STOP 
START ross had no intention of searching for the UNK STOP 
START he UNK the dead man onto the UNK yelled and UNK at the team and got out of there fast STOP 
START but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the UNK the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing STOP 
START a detailed UNK of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a UNK of rocks that might have been the UNK hiding place STOP 
START there were no tracks of either UNK or boots STOP 
START not even an empty UNK case could be found STOP 
START once again tom horn was the first and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately STOP 
START once again he shook his head kept his face UNK and his voice very calm and had a strongly supported UNK ready STOP 
START later riding in for some UNK enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of UNK he laid claim to the killing with the vague UNK he made STOP 
START UNK cow UNK is just a business proposition with me he'd UNK announce STOP 
START and i sort o' got a corner on the market STOP 
START tom a friend asked him once how come you UNK them UNK wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain UNK UNK STOP 
START he had lots of friends then as always STOP 
START even as he became widely known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in UNK seemed proud to call him a friend STOP 
START no man's name brought more UNK when it was announced in a UNK STOP 
START well he explained UNK you was a UNK UNK the long rope would you be most UNK of a UNK or a UNK yeah i can see that the friend was forced to agree STOP 
START but well it just don't seem UNK somehow UNK tall UNK UNK stared in UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK again in soft wonder STOP 
START i seen a lot o' things in my time STOP 
START i found a UNK once the UNK had UNK on an UNK hill and another time we ran across some UNK they'd caught tied UNK down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was UNK right out o' their UNK STOP 
START i heard o' texas UNK UNK a cow UNK up in green UNK and UNK the sun UNK 'em and squeeze him to death STOP 
START but there's one thing i never seen or heard of one thing i just don't think there is and that's a UNK way o' UNK a man the first two murders the warning notes were rarely ignored STOP 
START the lesson had been learned STOP 
START the examples were plain STOP 
START when fred UNK UNK charlie UNK moved into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time on a first notice if you don't leave this country within 3 days your life will be taken the same as UNK was STOP 
START this was the message found UNK to the cabin door STOP 
START UNK left within three days STOP 
START all through albany and UNK counties other men were doing the same STOP 
START houses of settlers UNK treated the company UNK as a natural UNK free for the taking were sitting empty with UNK growing high in their yards STOP 
START the small UNK tended fields of men UNK spent more time UNK cattle than farming were lying UNK STOP 
START no cow UNK could count on a jury of his sympathetic UNK to free him any longer STOP 
START jury judge and UNK were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could UNK anywhere at any time to UNK an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long UNK STOP 
START for three straight years tom horn UNK the southern UNK UNK and how many men he killed after lewis and powell if he killed lewis and powell will never be known STOP 
START it is possible although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every UNK murder in the state STOP 
START it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend UNK him STOP 
START for that legend was growing UNK UNK was UNK he received a price of $600 a man STOP 
START the best evidence is that he received a monthly wage of about UNK very good money in an era when top hands worked for UNK and found STOP 
START UNK had it he slipped two small rocks under each UNK head as a sort of UNK STOP 
START a detailed search of old UNK reports fails to UNK this in the slightest STOP 
START one thing was certain his method was effective so effective that after a time even the warning UNK were often unnecessary STOP 
START the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three UNK UNK out of the upper UNK country in a single week STOP 
START my UNK my stock in trade tom mentioned more than once STOP 
START he evidently couldn't UNK that it might be his UNK in the end STOP 
START he had made himself the UNK of the devil to the UNK STOP 
START but to the UNK who had been facing UNK from UNK losses and to the UNK who had been faced with UNK a few years earlier he was becoming a UNK different type of UNK figure STOP 
START such UNK as UNK and clay and the UNK brothers carried him on their books as a UNK even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown STOP 
START he made their UNK his headquarters and he helped out in their UNK STOP 
START in the cow camps tom horn was regarded as a hero as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local UNK STOP 
START the hands and their UNK saw him as a UNK knight of the range UNK a dedicated UNK against a UNK new society that was threatening a beloved way of life STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him STOP 
START by UNK UNK losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in UNK STOP

START throughout history the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others for good or bad STOP 
START since the industrial revolution when factories emerged this classical pattern has been followed STOP 
START until recently STOP 
START there have always been tales of UNK the competent UNK who became an administrator UNK or not and found he didn't like it scientist who UNK against the personnel and paper work much more commonly in recent years the engineer who found that other duties UNK with or eliminated his engineering contributions STOP 
START there have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very UNK managers or UNK in paper work to their own and the UNK UNK and loss STOP 
START this has been more evident since our products have incorporated UNK increased technology STOP 
START the UNK have been many and varied attempts to teach management techniques either in plant at special schools or in university crash courses provision of UNK assistants or associates STOP 
START but the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer STOP 
START some men have no talent for or interest in management them into management can only create trouble STOP 
START the old shop UNK still holds a good UNK is usually a bad boss STOP 
START yet our economy UNK UNK to recognition of UNK status as the UNK of success STOP 
START labor UNK to change its collar from blue to white STOP 
START all grades of management seek more UNK titles and UNK because of social pressures STOP 
START as several recent books have UNK we have become the most UNK nation in the world STOP 
START what can be done for the individual UNK who is extremely important and likely to be more so in the operation of the UNK oriented company is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside concerned about america's belief that UNK and success are measured in dollars and titles STOP 
START yet titles are UNK given only to management men and income tends to rise with title STOP 
START even the college professor in america has been affected STOP 
START it is as one engineer says indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could UNK UNK skills STOP 
START this difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course STOP 
START this leads one to conclude as you have that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people STOP 
START nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering UNK and chief engineers STOP 
START so we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the UNK problem and more UNK their solutions STOP 
START in the paragraphs that follow we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page STOP 
START first what title what UNK the more familiar plans for UNK UNK is that of general electric STOP 
START this is not a mutually exclusive plan is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the UNK path upward STOP 
START further the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path STOP 
START it is common to shift back and forth working up through a number of UNK and UNK positions STOP 
START actually there are a number of UNK positions in both operating departments and in the UNK services operation that are filled by men with successful UNK experience who are currently UNK their capabilities STOP 
START also moving into a UNK position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert STOP 
START as examples at UNK UNK b. warren formerly manager of the UNK division widely recognized as a UNK designer STOP 
START the late w. r. g. baker a pioneer in television design and UNK UNK UNK of the electronics division and later by his own choice an individual consultant STOP 
START harold e. UNK expert in UNK design for a long period UNK UNK of the measurements industrial products division and who currently approaching retirement is vice-president and consulting engineer in the UNK control division STOP 
START in the UNK plan a number of individual UNK have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers STOP 
START these positions carry such titles as consultant advanced development consulting engineer consulting engineer heat transfer consulting electrical engineer senior electrical engineer senior UNK STOP 
START UNK has a similar system with two UNK representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side consulting engineer or scientist as the case may be and advisory engineer or scientist STOP 
START many companies have systems particularly in r d which work more or less well depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration as will be UNK apparent in subsequent UNK STOP 
START another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is as one man says it that the UNK for UNK top people along UNK lines is UNK to the UNK trained approach STOP 
START senior staff engineer company instituted early in 1959 a vertical classification system consisting of four levels STOP 
START there is no formal UNK to the UNK ranks top UNK level senior staff engineer UNK status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision STOP 
START the second level senior engineer rates slightly below UNK supervision STOP 
START the expectation is that UNK UNK will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level with very few coming from the first level STOP 
START the company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for UNK engineers but probably not into executive levels STOP 
START in this organization about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision engineering or elsewhere STOP 
START this reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products which are not military STOP 
START several other examples central and UNK we have over 20 divisions each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer STOP 
START we have set up a central r d department as well as UNK departments about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants STOP 
START a separate research department is of course confined to new or future designs STOP 
START part of this headquarters staff however are engineering managers who work between UNK chief engineers and headquarters management STOP 
START these headquarters engineers headed by the vice-president engineering counsel and UNK UNK managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions STOP 
START these men are considered managers of engineers STOP 
START they must learn to wear several hats so to speak working with management sales and engineering problems related to the product STOP 
START we do not have people in our organization termed UNK or fellows who are specialists in one particular technical subject STOP 
START i suppose it is because we are just not big enough STOP 
START we have a few UNK retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems STOP 
START the only fellows in our company are those who have been honored by UNK UNK or UNK STOP 
START i am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist because of his wider UNK STOP 
START another structure we have tried to make both paths attractive so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either STOP 
START one way to UNK this is in the job structure STOP 
START we have these positions which compare directly af above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of UNK r aj STOP 
START the latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the UNK side STOP 
START we have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical UNK comparable to our higher levels of management but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president STOP 
START top job research scientist STOP 
START UNK four years ago we initiated a UNK ladder of UNK for technical persons STOP 
START the highest position is known as a research scientist STOP 
START this approach has not been entirely satisfactory STOP 
START the primary UNK appears to lie with the technical people themselves and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society STOP 
START scientists who UNK hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it STOP 
START we have discovered that the UNK UNK such as private offices and private UNK are extremely important although we have attempted to provide these status symbols support of the UNK plan has been UNK despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist UNK with that of men in top UNK positions STOP 
START a serious problem accompanying the UNK approach is the difficulty of clearly UNK responsibilities and standards of performance for each level STOP 
START with no set standards there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance STOP 
START promotion is too often based on UNK and time in salary grade instead of merit STOP 
START if no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level the result is a department UNK with UNK UNK personnel STOP 
START staff engineer UNK manager we have two approaches for the technical man the position of staff engineer which is UNK as high in salary as department manager an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work STOP 
START these are only halfway measures and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige STOP 
START a complete plan we have made limited application of the parallel ladder plan STOP 
START the highest UNK UNK engineering title is research engineer STOP 
START the salary schedule permits UNK greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision engineering section head STOP 
START we also have an engineering section head research engineer classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer STOP 
START above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder STOP 
START we also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a professional and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence STOP 
START these include encouragement of and assistance to the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers STOP 
START we have two media for UNK individual technical activity a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers STOP 
START publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies STOP 
START a recent and more pertinent action has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for engineering STOP 
START this function is UNK by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title member of the technical staff STOP 
START UNK compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management STOP 
START additional symbols of status are granted such as reserved parking distinctive UNK passes UNK special UNK and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit STOP 
START we presently are involved in UNK a new development center STOP 
START operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status STOP 
START all scientific staff members will have the title UNK member STOP 
START the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific UNK acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field STOP 
START contrary to usual UNK UNK the position to which UNK members report UNK will not necessarily UNK the duties of the UNK member therefore are not necessarily evaluated as highly STOP 
START these recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence STOP 
START it is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts STOP 
START fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that in the business community prestige and status are UNK in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he UNK in the management functions STOP

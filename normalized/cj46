START the vast central valley of california is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world STOP 
START during the summer of 1960 it became the setting for a bitter and basic UNK struggle STOP 
START the UNK in this economic struggle are the agricultural workers UNK committee UNK of the UNK and the agricultural employers of the state STOP 
START by virtue of the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces STOP 
START it is not a pleasant or easy position but one we have UNK to maintain STOP 
START we have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose STOP 
START inevitably one side was pleased and the other UNK regardless of how we ruled STOP 
START often the UNK parties interpreted our decision as UNK UNK toward the other STOP 
START we have UNK ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an UNK proceeding STOP 
START it is UNK nevertheless to read in a labor weekly UNK UNK down to UNK and then to be confronted with a UNK publication which states UNK UNK obviously phony and UNK strikes as UNK UNK STOP 
START for a number of years there have been UNK attempts in california to organize farm workers STOP 
START these attempts met with little UNK for a variety of reasons STOP 
START they were UNK financed without experienced leadership and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole STOP 
START this past year the pattern has been different the UNK program had the full support of the UNK which supplied staff and money to the UNK as well as moral support STOP 
START leadership was experienced and UNK and financial resources were significant STOP 
START regardless of where personal UNK may lie as between the parties failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life STOP 
START as a result of these changed conditions the impact of the UNK effort on agricultural UNK relations has been much greater than in the past STOP 
START the UNK has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor the strike and the UNK line with considerable success particularly in the area of wages STOP 
START by the very nature of the situation it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management STOP 
START to date at least the strategy of the UNK has been selective is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any UNK engagement with management throughout an area or the state STOP 
START primarily we became involved in these UNK because of our UNK obligations under our farm placement program STOP 
START normally because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility STOP 
START but the current issues arose out of the UNK act concerning UNK to an establishment where a labor dispute exists and out of public law UNK and the UNK labor agreement if mexican UNK were employed at the ranch STOP 
START most of us remember and think of the UNK act in its historical sense as a major UNK in the development of public placement services STOP 
START UNK do we think of it as a living continuing operating control over the system STOP 
START however when labor UNK arise its provisions come clearly into play STOP 
START california has accepted the provisions of that act as have all other states by UNK into our code section UNK a provision that the state of california UNK the provisions of the UNK act and will observe and UNK with the requirements of that act STOP 
START with respect to labor UNK the UNK act states only in carrying out the provisions of this act the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or UNK to UNK before they are referred to employment STOP 
START other provisions of the act UNK the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions and he has done so STOP 
START the pertinent regulation for our purposes is section UNK as follows UNK in labor dispute situations STOP 
START no person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which 1 is vacant because the former UNK is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute or 2 the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute STOP 
START with respect to positions not covered by UNK 1 or 2 of this paragraph any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his UNK STOP 
START in UNK this regulation let us take the last sentence first STOP 
START it permits UNK under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute STOP 
START assume for example a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields STOP 
START the packing shed workers go on strike STOP 
START there is no dispute involving UNK STOP 
START we concluded that we may refer workers to the UNK but not the packing shed work provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute STOP 
START so far no UNK cases have UNK under this provision STOP 
START it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue STOP 
START note that it UNK UNK under either condition 1 or condition 2 STOP 
START employer representatives have contended that the secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the grounds that the UNK act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists STOP 
START into court the matter got into the courts this way one of the early strikes called by the UNK was at the UNK UNK UNK in UNK county STOP 
START we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute STOP 
START accordingly under UNK 1 of the UNK regulation we suspended UNK to the employer STOP 
START incidentally no mexican UNK were involved STOP 
START the employer seeking to continue his harvest UNK our right to cease UNK to him and sought relief in the superior court of UNK county STOP 
START the court issued a temporary UNK order UNK us to resume UNK STOP 
START we of course UNK the court order STOP 
START however the attorney general of california at the request of the secretary of labor sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the federal district court on grounds that it was UNK a federal issue since the validity of the UNK regulation was being UNK STOP 
START however the federal court held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the UNK act into its own code and presumably therefore also the regulations it was now a state matter STOP 
START it accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction UNK the california superior court made the UNK order permanent STOP 
START under that order we have continued referring workers to the ranch STOP 
START a similar case arose at the UNK ranch in UNK county and the superior court of that county issued similar UNK orders STOP 
START the UNK have UNK argued that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the UNK regulation STOP 
START i cannot accept that view either as a lawyer or as an administrator STOP 
START legal considerations first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved STOP 
START it is an accepted UNK principle in california that a superior court decision does not constitute a binding legal UNK STOP 
START it is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard STOP 
START it is not binding upon another superior court which could rule to the contrary STOP 
START only when a decision is rendered by the district court of appeal or of course the supreme court is a binding UNK established STOP 
START in that event we can correctly say that we have received an UNK interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be UNK in other superior courts STOP 
START but over and beyond the UNK need for a binding UNK decision i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts which in effect UNK the UNK regulation are not a correct interpretation of the UNK power under the federal law STOP 
START i believe i am in good company in this view STOP 
START the attorney general of california UNK in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the district court of appeal STOP 
START the attorney general of the united states in considering the power of the secretary to issue similar regulations under the UNK act relating to the interstate UNK of farm workers has rendered an opinion UNK his authority STOP 
START further and as an evidence of legislative intent only the senate of the united states recently defeated by a substantial majority the UNK amendment to the fair labor standards act which would have specifically limited the UNK authority of the secretary in these matters STOP 
START next let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals STOP 
START there is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in UNK STOP 
START the UNK of the issue are enormous STOP 
START a decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to UNK situations and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as UNK STOP 
START the public interest is so dominant in such an issue that i cannot be so UNK as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two superior courts in the state STOP 
START it is an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial UNK is achieved STOP 
START as an administrator i cannot place the employment service in california in UNK of being out of UNK with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the UNK of appeal open to me STOP 
START to have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in superior court in my opinion would have placed us clearly out of UNK with the UNK act and would have immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so inclined to UNK the governor of such UNK set a date for hearing and issue his finding STOP 
START the impact of UNK under the UNK act is clear the UNK of some UNK million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or as a UNK the taking over by the federal government of its operation STOP 
START thus far the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of UNK where the job is vacant due to a strike condition 1 in the regulation of the secretary STOP 
START none has yet UNK under condition 2 relating to UNK to jobs the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute STOP 
START here the problem is essentially one of UNK the word filling STOP 
START should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job UNK union membership union jurisdiction and the like should it have a broader UNK of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of filling the job STOP 
START because of the uncertainty of this definition i UNK the interpretation of the secretary of labor STOP 
START he has advised me that the UNK interpretation is the proper one is that if wages for example is the only issue in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute we may continue to make UNK STOP

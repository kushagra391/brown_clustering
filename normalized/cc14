START UNK UNK sang so UNK saturday night at hunter college that it seems a pity to have to register any UNK STOP 
START still a UNK or two must be entered STOP 
START UNK is of course UNK STOP 
START for style and assurance for a supreme and UNK bearing there is still no one who can touch her STOP 
START if the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be it is still a beautiful instrument controlled and flexible STOP 
START put to the service of UNK of UNK UNK UNK and UNK in a UNK and musical way it made its effect with ease and precision STOP 
START but what has been happening recently might be described as UNK UNK STOP 
START instead of her old confidence in the UNK UNK most moving musical expression miss UNK is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride that subtle UNK that sometimes UNK a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside STOP 
START the symptoms saturday night were UNK STOP 
START clever light songs were UNK UNK tragic songs a little too UNK STOP 
START there was an extra pause here a UNK or a sigh there here and there an extra little twist of a word or note all in the interest of effect STOP 
START the result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the UNK touched up almost to the point of UNK STOP 
START there were UNK musical phrases too and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication STOP 
START miss UNK and her excellent pianist john UNK often achieved the highest UNK ideals of the UNK tradition STOP 
START all the more reason why there should have been no place for the UNK UNK is too great an artist to need them STOP 
START the dance dancers and dance UNK UNK of them had a much better time of it at UNK stadium on saturday night than all had had two nights earlier when stadium concerts presented the first of two dance programs STOP 
START on saturday the orchestra was UNK situated down on the field the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing and the order of the program improved STOP 
START there was UNK a UNK for the UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK de UNK appeared in the first new york performance of mr. UNK roots of the blues a work given its UNK three weeks ago at the boston arts festival STOP 
START otherwise the program included as on thursday the UNK design for strings the UNK UNK the UNK UNK the UNK and the UNK de UNK from the UNK STOP 
START maria UNK and UNK UNK who UNK the UNK UNK de UNK were also seen in the UNK UNK de UNK from don UNK another brilliant UNK that displayed their technical UNK UNK STOP 
START among the other UNK ballet dancers of the evening UNK carroll and UNK allen were particularly impressive in their roles in the UNK a work that depends so much upon the precision and UNK of the two principal UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK roots of the blues an UNK and very human modern dance work provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening STOP 
START as brother john UNK sang five blues to the guitar and drum UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK mr. UNK and miss de UNK went through UNK dances that were by turns UNK threatening UNK and UNK STOP 
START their UNK were two UNK a chair and a palm fan STOP 
START he wore the clothes of a UNK and she was UNK UNK in a yellow and orange dress STOP 
START the UNK UNK and UNK of both dancers were UNK in UNK UNK UNK and UNK that were almost invariably UNK in a work of strong sometimes almost frightening tensions STOP 
START roots of the blues may not be for gentle souls but others should welcome its UNK impact STOP 
START perhaps it is better to stay at home STOP 
START the UNK UNK preserves his UNK STOP 
START this somewhat UNK comment may be found in blue skies brown studies a collection of travel UNK by william sansom who would never consider staying home for long STOP 
START mr. sansom is english UNK UNK UNK the UNK author of numerous volumes of short stories of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something UNK between STOP 
START the only man alive who seems qualified by his learning his disposition and his UNK to a baroque UNK of language to UNK the literary mantle of UNK UNK mr. sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to UNK worthy of a UNK UNK creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a UNK beauty her third and an american UNK his fourth STOP 
START the result is rather wonderful but so rich as to be UNK if taken in too thick UNK STOP 
START there are sixteen UNK in blue skies brown studies STOP 
START most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines STOP 
START all are well written and are UNK STOP 
START but even if mr. sansom UNK too hard to UNK more UNK of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow he still can charm and UNK STOP 
START too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another STOP 
START mr. sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a UNK composed sentence with an intense UNK in all the UNK resources of english with a thick shower of sophisticated cultural references STOP 
START a UNK UNK i like to UNK a place and UNK what it really UNK and looks like its color its particular kind of life STOP 
START this is an exact description of what mr. sansom does STOP 
START he UNK UNK facts STOP 
START he only rarely tells a personal UNK and hardly ever sketches an individual or UNK his opinions STOP 
START it is an over-all impression mr. sansom UNK for an impression compounded of visual details of a UNK mixture of UNK of much loving attention to architecture and scenery of lights and shadows of UNK of atmosphere and of UNK of the past STOP 
START william sansom writes only about europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as london vienna the french UNK and the UNK UNK STOP 
START but no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions STOP 
START a writer lives at best in a state of UNK he says STOP 
START beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all STOP 
START to UNK that feeling he writes STOP 
START this may not be true of many writers but it certainly is true of mr. sansom STOP 
START so in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional UNK of st. UNK that still UNK in st. UNK the sun and the heat of UNK lands always much UNK and UNK to an englishman than to an american used to summers in new york or kansas city the supreme UNK to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants la UNK UNK which is situated on the UNK twenty miles west of the nice airport at the infinite variety of london STOP 
START mr. sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls to those who recall easily the UNK of UNK and the UNK paintings of UNK STOP 
START he can UNK a neat phrase a street UNK with an UNK of people with UNK wide and UNK as a UNK ears a UNK a landscape UNK of UNK and clarity STOP 
START and for all his UNK almost UNK UNK he can make one recognize the UNK of an unexpected comparison STOP 
START beauty borrowed from UNK in one of his best UNK mr. sansom UNK his enthusiasm for the many country UNK designed by UNK UNK himself that dot the UNK of UNK STOP 
START how far that UNK and UNK style has shed its influence mr. sansom UNK us thus the white UNK UNK southern UNK is directly UNK via the grey and UNK stone of UNK england to the golden UNK of one particular part of the blue south the UNK orbit stretching out from UNK the old mind of UNK UNK still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a southern porch the deep UNK of his UNK music rise firm above the UNK UNK in the kitchen his feeling for light and shade brings a UNK from a tall UNK UNK his sense of columns UNK the warm UNK night has brought together a million couple of UNK lips STOP 
START nice even if a UNK UNK STOP 
START blue skies brown studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs STOP 
START in recent days there have been extensive UNK over the absence of original drama on television but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio STOP 
START UNK the UNK UNK on the UNK band has decided to do what it can to correct this UNK UNK STOP 
START yesterday it offered poised for violence by jean UNK STOP 
START UNK is on the right track in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre as the UNK and british UNK corporations continue to demonstrate STOP 
START unfortunately poised for violence was not the UNK vehicle with which to make the point STOP 
START mrs. UNK work is written for the stage it is mentioned for an UNK production in the fall and in addition UNK an UNK structure that particularly needs to be seen if UNK is to be encouraged STOP 
START the UNK device is to explore UNK UNK with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of UNK models who remain part of someone UNK painting rather than just be themselves STOP 
START in a succession of scenes they appear in different UNK UNK of a cafe performers in a UNK and UNK in a family picnic but in each instance they inevitably put UNK before beauty STOP 
START somewhere in mrs. UNK play there is both protest and UNK of merit STOP 
START but its UNK UNK and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a UNK UNK begins to UNK STOP 
START moreover her central figures are so UNK UNK their UNK assignments that none UNK as an UNK individual in his own right or as a UNK symbol of UNK UNK STOP 
START but quite UNK an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the UNK words STOP 
START which in itself is an immediate reward of the UNK experiment radio drama has its own special demands that badly need UNK STOP 
START a weekly UNK for contemporary music from the UNK UNK of UNK to the UNK and UNK of electronic music is UNK its fourth anniversary this month STOP 
START titled what's new in music UNK program is heard saturday afternoons on radio station aj STOP 
START the brief notes UNK each work offer UNK historical or technical points and many listeners are probably grateful for being UNK taken by the hand through an often difficult UNK STOP 
START the show is UNK and written by the UNK assistant continuity editor chuck UNK STOP 
START the first saturday in each month is set aside for new UNK STOP 
START last UNK interesting UNK included UNK UNK UNK UNK richard UNK and a brief UNK from a new space opera by the UNK composer UNK UNK STOP 
START other UNK are devoted to studies of a selected american composer a particular type of music or the music of a given country STOP 
START it is UNK that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene STOP 
START but one wishes when the appetite is UNK as it was in the case of the UNK UNK from the UNK opera that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their UNK and for a closer UNK look at the sense and nature of the UNK STOP 
START the UNK dance company dropped in at madison square garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long american tour to a close STOP 
START it is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its new york engagement earlier this season but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won UNK heart STOP 
START it is good to see those numbers again STOP 
START the suite of old russian dances that opened that UNK program with the slow and modest entrance of the UNK and built steadily into typical UNK vigor and warmth amusing UNK in which a UNK young man is given his UNK lovely and of course vigorous UNK or the meadow three UNK dances entitled UNK sweet and funny little dance about potato UNK called UNK the UNK picture of social life in an earlier day called city UNK are all just as good as one remembers them to have been and they are welcome back STOP 
START so for that matter are the newer dances the UNK dance with its animal movements that UNK UNK act by UNK UNK called the UNK the UNK and beautiful UNK celebration called summer the three UNK of UNK UNK up on their UNK and of course the UNK rock UNK roll STOP

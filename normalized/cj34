START it is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less successful in UNK with tone systems than with UNK or UNK STOP 
START no single explanation is adequate to account for this STOP 
START improvement however is urgent and at least three things will be needed STOP 
START the first is a UNK sample of successful UNK analyses STOP 
START even beginning students in UNK are made familiar with an UNK variety of UNK systems both in their general UNK and in many specific details STOP 
START an advanced student has read a considerable number of UNK of UNK systems including some of the more unusual types STOP 
START by contrast even experienced linguists commonly know no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the UNK distinction between register and UNK languages STOP 
START this limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely UNK work with tone STOP 
START tone analysis will continue to be difficult and UNK until a more representative selection of systems is UNK to every practicing field linguist STOP 
START papers like these four if widely read will contribute UNK to improvement of our analytic work STOP 
START the second need is better field techniques STOP 
START the great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of UNK types those who are convinced that tone cannot be UNK those who are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally those who are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis those who take a UNK view of the whole matter STOP 
START the result has been neglect UNK efforts or UNK treatment STOP 
START as these UNK UNK so must the cure STOP 
START analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone is impossible and that it is simple STOP 
START they will give suggestions that can be worked up into field procedures STOP 
START good field techniques will not only UNK linguists for better work but also help them overcome negative attitudes STOP 
START actually none of these papers says much directly about field techniques STOP 
START but it is worth UNK that very little has been published on any phase of field techniques in UNK STOP 
START these things have been UNK by other means but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic results STOP 
START the third need is for better theory STOP 
START we should expect that general UNK theory should be as adequate for tone as for UNK and UNK but it has not been STOP 
START this can only be for one of two reasons either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory and hence techniques or our existing theories are UNK general STOP 
START if as i suspect the problem is largely of the second sort then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all UNK UNK STOP 
START one issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different UNK UNK STOP 
START since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either UNK or UNK systems we might expect that they would be the UNK part of a UNK analysis STOP 
START actual practice does not often work out this way STOP 
START tone systems are certainly more complex than the number of units would suggest and often UNK more difficult than much larger UNK systems STOP 
START UNK has suggested one explanation STOP 
START tone languages use for UNK contrasts speech UNK which also function heavily in UNK use STOP 
START this may both UNK the attention of the UNK and cause confusion for the more UNK STOP 
START the problem is to UNK the UNK features of pitch from the UNK UNK features STOP 
START of course something of the same sort occurs with other UNK of the UNK UNK UNK have both a UNK and an individual component STOP 
START but in general the individual variation is a small thing added onto basic UNK features of greater magnitude STOP 
START with tone individual differences may be greater than the UNK contrasts which are UNK on them STOP 
START pitch differences from one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far exceed the small differences between tones STOP 
START however any such suggestion accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone or in developing a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic difficulties that occur even when tone is UNK recorded STOP 
START a second explanation is suggested by the material described in UNK paper STOP 
START tone and UNK often become seriously UNK STOP 
START neither can be adequately UNK until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the other STOP 
START other pairs of UNK UNK also UNK or UNK in this way example duration sometimes figures in both the UNK system and the UNK STOP 
START some UNK features for example UNK catch or UNK are sometimes to be assigned to UNK UNK and sometimes to UNK systems STOP 
START but no other two UNK systems are as difficult to UNK as are tone and UNK in some languages STOP 
START this explanation of tone difficulties however does not apply in all languages STOP 
START in some the UNK type mentioned above interaction of tone and UNK is restricted to the ends of UNK UNK STOP 
START in many of the UNK UNK can be safely ignored and much of the UNK analysis can be done without any study of UNK STOP 
START still even in such languages tone analysis has not been as simple as one might expect STOP 
START a third explanation is suggested by UNK analysis of UNK tone STOP 
START there we see a basically simple UNK system UNK in a very complex and UNK UNK system STOP 
START while the UNK can be very easily stated no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement until UNK UNK can be related in some way to UNK units i.e. until the UNK is worked out or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success STOP 
START in the typical tone language UNK UNK is of the same order of complexity as UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK systems which must support these UNK systems however are very different STOP 
START the inventory of tones is much smaller and commonly the contrasts range along one single dimension pitch level STOP 
START UNK systems are not merely larger they are UNK STOP 
START UNK rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system STOP 
START the possibilities in the UNK system are very numerous and only a small portion of them are actually used STOP 
START UNK connected by a UNK rule commonly show a good bit of UNK UNK possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system STOP 
START UNK UNK in a common case can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone STOP 
START the possibilities are few and the total number of rules may be considerably greater STOP 
START often therefore there are a number of rules having the same effect and commonly other sets of rules as well having the opposite effect STOP 
START UNK UNK is much more UNK to the beginning UNK than UNK UNK even when the total number of rules is no greater STOP 
START the difficulty of analysis of any UNK in the UNK is an UNK function of the size smaller systems are more UNK for any given degree of UNK complexity STOP 
START this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties of UNK analysis as well as the fact that UNK systems are often more UNK than UNK systems STOP 
START the statement of the system is a different matter STOP 
START smaller systems can of course be stated much more UNK STOP 
START a UNK system can be stated without reference to UNK but it cannot always be found without UNK STOP 
START and the more complex the UNK system is in relation to the UNK base the less easily a UNK system will be UNK without close attention to the UNK at least the less satisfying will a UNK statement be if it cannot be related through UNK rules to UNK meaningful structures STOP 
START the design of UNK has received much less attention from linguists than the problem deserves STOP 
START there has been a tendency on the part of many american linguists to assume that a UNK UNK will automatically be the best possible UNK and that the only real problem will then be the social one of UNK acceptance STOP 
START this seems naive STOP 
START most others have been content to give only the most general attention to the UNK and most obvious features of the UNK when UNK UNK STOP 
START apparently the feeling is that anything more would be involvement in technical UNK of possible UNK interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs STOP 
START the result of this attitude has been the domination of many UNK conferences by such considerations as UNK UNK which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain UNK carried over from european languages STOP 
START many of the suggested systems seem to have only the most UNK relationship to the language structures that they UNK to represent STOP 
START linguists have not always been more UNK than practical people and sometimes have insisted on UNK trivial points while UNK things of much greater significance STOP 
START as a result many people have been confirmed in their conviction that UNK design is not an activity to which experts can contribute anything but confusion STOP 
START a. e. sharp in UNK and UNK in UNK UNK one set of related UNK questions and its UNK background in detail STOP 
START his objective is merely to determine what distinctions of length and UNK it may be desirable to make explicit in a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START to do so he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts of the UNK thoroughly and in detail STOP 
START in the process he develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort that are often difficult STOP 
START a few of his examples are of very great interest and the whole discussion of some importance for theory STOP 
START his UNK recommendations are no UNK acceptance of UNK on the one hand or of UNK on the other STOP 
START rather he UNK each UNK fact in the light of its UNK usefulness STOP 
START he UNK that some changes can be made in the current UNK which will UNK improve its usefulness but UNK to suggest precise UNK devices to effect these changes STOP 
START i hope his suggestions are given the consideration they deserve in UNK circles STOP 
START this however will not UNK their practical usefulness as they rather clearly indicate what thorough UNK investigation can contribute to UNK design STOP 
START we need many more studies of this sort if the design of written languages is to be put on a sound basis STOP 
START one other paper deals with a UNK problem UNK harmony in UNK by j. UNK STOP 
START this UNK the already widely known facts in terms of UNK STOP 
START as a UNK it makes only a small contribution to knowledge of UNK STOP 
START but it would seem more intended as a tract UNK the UNK theory than a paper directed to the specific problems of UNK UNK STOP 
START the paper has a certain value as a comparatively easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treats a fairly simple and UNK phenomenon where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional though not structural statement STOP 
START it does show one feature of the system that has not been previously described STOP 
START but it does not as it claims demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods STOP 
START it seems to me that it rather easily can STOP 
START five of the papers deal with UNK problems STOP 
START on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety of subject matter STOP 
START my comments must be UNK than the papers deserve STOP 
START w. h. UNK writes on the verbal radical in UNK STOP 
START this must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement to his early a short description of UNK in UNK STOP 
START it exhibits much the same UNK technique and is open to much the same criticisms STOP 
START the treatment seems UNK UNK and complex largely because the method is UNK and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent UNK STOP

START he wondered if he had played it wrong STOP

START how do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club of course david has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer or a lawyer or an editor do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential that he will find himself give him time give him a chance STOP 
START cady snapped the UNK blind shut and slammed himself down before the UNK rolled in a fresh sheet and gave his letter the same savage attention he UNK on a salesman who needed to have the UNK taken off his thick head STOP 
START what a production to make of a letter UNK your own son UNK went up in UNK at his UNK panic STOP

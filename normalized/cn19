START he had better write a UNK to walter STOP 
START he opened the myth book again and there along the UNK next to robert UNK imaginative interpretation of the creation of the UNK from UNK UNK were the names of four UNK bars and meredith UNK address STOP 
START the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret UNK STOP 
START the code which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined to find out and put to use STOP 
START a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith and that might be good for something STOP 
START nicolas called on his UNK a line came back UNK man and all the UNK are UNK UNK STOP 
START that ought to draw a laugh nicolas UNK as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind STOP 
START and indeed his UNK did draw from walter a letter UNK his friend the poet nicolas UNK to his friend meredith UNK STOP 
START five days later on receiving it meredith sat UNK his UNK on his writing table STOP 
START UNK UNK cried STOP 
START his hand was large and square and heavily UNK STOP 
START the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt STOP 
START his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months STOP 
START he had returned to the pension a week ago STOP 
START now he was just in the late poems of UNK and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him plus next UNK class preparation STOP 
START he was determined to spend an UNK summer STOP 
START well maybe UNK wouldn't call STOP 
START UNK fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him UNK UNK die UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK of UNK gradually faded as meredith asked himself should he translate it how the dark UNK laughed more UNK the UNK UNK are laughing he missed the point that the UNK UNK might be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas UNK STOP 
START but nicolas too was being interrupted that morning STOP 
START not by the UNK sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the english gardens and sent him off to sleep by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and UNK regarded him STOP 
START should she wake him didn't have the heart STOP 
START her heart her UNK feeling in fact her being was too busy expressing itself as quietly UNK by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep under a blanket in a park like a scene from UNK STOP 
START she was just not able to break the spell STOP 
START would she have been able to had she known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of UNK marked bars look nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys no sex see if all these UNK was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money STOP 
START ballet dancer protests tears and take what you want nicolas i am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful STOP 
START to this UNK UNK nicolas had replied UNK i can use this blanket STOP 
START and when you get off this job tonight well you can UNK something to eat STOP 
START and as a matter of fact nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that UNK early UNK even in summer are UNK with UNK STOP 
START he had always known how to find a bed and on his own terms STOP 
START he used the blanket for late morning UNK when UNK of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few possessions STOP 
START mary jane UNK knew none of this STOP 
START her nicolas lay curled in the sun like a UNK black hair falling over his eyes STOP 
START she was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth STOP 
START this was surely a reunion in art it was all that poetry promised STOP 
START that long night with nicolas and UNK in UNK had opened her eyes STOP 
START his advice his voice saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her on the contrary he had put his head back and she had UNK his hair this was all new STOP 
START her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse of a new faith STOP 
START the next day he was gone STOP 
START mary jane might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most determined STOP 
START even so it took her several days to force walter to tell her UNK UNK STOP 
START packing a small suitcase UNK her husband whom she found in UNK bar that she was taking a train to germany to get away for a while UNK his arm UNK a drink getting on the train all this had only taken her two hours STOP 
START she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens STOP 
START dear girl walter had finally said he writes me that he is sleeping in the english gardens STOP 
START how like him jane had UNK said STOP 
START his address walter added is that great UNK home the american express STOP 
START and i will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband STOP 
START for the last half hour mary jane had UNK half the length of the gardens and at last come upon her knight STOP 
START his presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her freedom from the UNK of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels STOP 
START she set down her suitcase STOP 
START should she wake him STOP 
START smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched STOP 
START the sun grew UNK as it approached the UNK STOP 
START nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the UNK of a UNK car STOP 
START he began UNK STOP 
START in his dream he cried slow down for UNK half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass STOP 
START his nose was UNK STOP 
START he UNK STOP 
START he blew his nose UNK between his fingers STOP 
START he spit STOP 
START he half sat up and UNK at the hair on his forehead and then more vigorously between his legs STOP 
START he UNK he stretched STOP 
START mary jane got up quietly and walked away STOP 
START twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the UNK pension her tears dried UNK a hotel form and asking for a bath STOP 
START mary jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and UNK in all the major and minor cities STOP 
START she had UNK to this world STOP 
START the UNK who was UNK by her told her your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair STOP 
START families are very interesting STOP 
START nevertheless there is no bath STOP 
START but a young american has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it this once STOP 
START and then we shall see STOP 
START the UNK was partial to the word shall STOP 
START meredith was UNK when the UNK knocked at his door and told him she is a great beauty we allow her not to have a bath she is a sad beauty i believe STOP 
START you shall see her at dinner STOP 
START rather UNK he listened to the bath water running it stopped he began UNK UNK sitting up in a UNK way STOP 
START before dinner he UNK for the second time that day STOP 
START a thing he did not like doing generally STOP 
START singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part of his italian sun UNK STOP 
START he UNK his muscles for several minutes got into the tub and then grew UNK of UNK as he washed STOP 
START in the small gallery used as the UNK dining room meredith sat down at his place and as always began UNK the young UNK STOP 
START he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets she also served as maid when he saw the UNK followed by a UNK blond girl approaching his table STOP 
START it would be literary license calculated to UNK life to say that he oh dropped his UNK so startled was he by mary UNK beauty STOP 
START yet he did drop his UNK with the ordinary country girl as much in UNK to the UNK as UNK that here indeed was something special STOP 
START mary jane had made very little effort STOP 
START above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green UNK sweater with as he soon perceived no UNK beneath STOP 
START her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders STOP 
START perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and UNK that day STOP 
START she had touched her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip UNK which made her lips UNK but no UNK than usual STOP 
START the result was grace and UNK STOP 
START as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank you for the use of your bath when she sat down opposite him spoken in a low voice came across with UNK of intelligence and control STOP 
START meredith began falling in love STOP 
START soup only this morning UNK oh i couldn't possibly eat all this then you were UNK poems this afternoon UNK if you think i would understand it smile STOP 
START what a beautiful room STOP 
START like as if it were built of books STOP 
START having opened the windows onto the UNK lit the fire translated the UNK meredith grinned and took down a little UNK of books bound together in old UNK STOP 
START opening these he brought out a UNK bottle and small gold UNK glasses hidden inside it STOP 
START i think the maids UNK in the afternoon STOP 
START those sweet girls you're UNK STOP 
START it UNK a little like UNK STOP 
START what's its name she whispered UNK to herself several times UNK it STOP 
START would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself voice was always deep with rough bass notes in it reading on UNK even in the large auditorium of the UNK poetry center nights his voice was intimate thoughtful and a UNK shy STOP 
START his new poem a love poem told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed STOP 
START the husband points the steps out with his UNK its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind UNK with appetite UNK her hands that UNK my UNK and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes UNK all night mary jane asked herself if meredith was UNK at this line or was it the fire but he read on STOP 
START in the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go on in dull domestic UNK i watch her staring face still blind start UNK in UNK to dirty waters UNK UNK and UNK waiting below stairs in her mind STOP 
START mary jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words STOP 
START oh it's that myth about UNK and what is her name can never UNK it STOP 
START she repeated UNK STOP 
START the third time rather UNK STOP 
START but with her hand poem again STOP 
START she raised her face and nodded it's sweet and very sad STOP 
START they discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds STOP 
START they finished the small bottle of UNK STOP 
START she UNK she was unhappy he asked was it her husband began to explain there was this poet in italy he interrupted please don't judge all poets STOP 
START they smiled STOP 
START at her door two or three hours later mary jane whispered everyone is asleep STOP 
START UNK her he whispered several times UNK STOP 
START the third time rather UNK STOP 
START but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited UNK and finally UNK UNK with the feel of her hand against his mouth STOP

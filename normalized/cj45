START a STOP 
START UNK for selecting mail questionnaire method there were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available 1 interviews in depth with a few selected companies and 2 the more limited UNK of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire STOP 
START while the method of UNK a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to UNK fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies STOP 
START as a result it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in UNK some of the fundamental and UNK problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government STOP 
START it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest UNK inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature STOP 
START it is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations STOP 
START there is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different UNK STOP 
START simple yes or no answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various UNK may have STOP 
START a UNK may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question STOP 
START there is also the problem of the UNK frame of reference STOP 
START is the UNK making a recommendation for his own benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific government department or service for the benefit of the defense program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the taxpayers is also the question of whether the UNK based his answers on UNK information and carefully considered judgment or whether his answers were casual UNK STOP 
START finally there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held whether it is a firm opinion or one that the UNK UNK only slightly over the alternatives STOP 
START the research team was very UNK of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire STOP 
START under the circumstances however the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point STOP 
START in the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure and UNK used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations STOP 
START b STOP 
START UNK of the questionnaire the questionnaire was designed to UNK three types of information 1 the facts regarding certain characteristics of the UNK including their experience with and interest in UNK defense business 2 the actual selling and buying practices of the UNK 3 the attitudes and opinions of the UNK concerning UNK procedures and the methods of UNK defense contracts STOP 
START it was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the UNK would offer UNK to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did STOP 
START the major sections of the questionnaire see UNK b are devoted to the following 1 STOP 
START UNK for UNK UNK part a of the questionnaire 2 STOP 
START UNK of defense sales activities part b of the questionnaire 3 STOP 
START UNK practices in participating in UNK UNK for defense business part c of the questionnaire 4 STOP 
START UNK practices in participating in UNK UNK for defense purposes part d of the questionnaire 5 STOP 
START UNK opinions regarding UNK UNK part e of the questionnaire 6 STOP 
START UNK opinions regarding UNK UNK part f of the questionnaire 7 STOP 
START UNK UNK regarding the methods of UNK defense contracts part g of the questionnaire the questionnaire provided a place for the name of the UNK but stated that identification of the UNK was UNK STOP 
START the questionnaire also stated that in any event all UNK would be treated UNK STOP 
START it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves STOP 
START c STOP 
START UNK and UNK of the questionnaire the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months STOP 
START in june 1960 an early draft of the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of washington STOP 
START several days after the companies had received the questionnaire members of the research team UNK the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any UNK or difficulties the UNK might have experienced in completing the questionnaire STOP 
START this test resulted in further UNK of the questionnaire STOP 
START the research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might be different when no phone or personal UNK was made STOP 
START accordingly another test of the UNK was made STOP 
START the revised draft was mailed in july 1960 to 100 firms throughout the united states STOP 
START fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from UNK names submitted by member companies of the UNK industries association UNK list and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of UNK names UNK by the research team from the thomas register UNK list STOP 
START the method of UNK the UNK and UNK lists will be described later STOP 
START ten days after the UNK were mailed UNK UNK UNK were sent UNK those companies which had not yet returned their UNK to do so at once STOP 
START UNK returns in all were received STOP 
START the responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the UNK STOP 
START the cover letter questionnaire and UNK UNK were then revised into final form see UNK a b and c STOP 
START d STOP 
START UNK of UNK lists the objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs STOP 
START the firms to receive the UNK were selected with this objective in mind STOP 
START three lists of companies were made and used in the study STOP 
START the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work STOP 
START the primary consideration in the UNK of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers STOP 
START the second list was derived from a group of approximately UNK names supplied to the research team by the UNK industries association STOP 
START these names were secured from member companies by the association from the UNK sources listed in UNK aj STOP 
START each source selected from its approved UNK list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems STOP 
START where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address STOP 
START the UNK lists supplied by the UNK member companies were UNK and UNK names were eliminated STOP 
START there was further UNK of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive STOP 
START the remaining names were then checked against the thomas register list see below and UNK names were removed from the UNK lists STOP 
START by these steps the final UNK list was reduced from UNK to UNK STOP 
START the third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the thomas register STOP 
START it was UNK as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the UNK industries association were UNK different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs STOP 
START such a difference might have resulted from 1 STOP 
START -hlthe fact that the UNK industries association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe fact that companies on the UNK lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection STOP 
START accordingly as UNK they might have different opinions and practices than an UNK composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START -hlthe fact that UNK lists might not have been selected on a random basis STOP 
START the control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the UNK UNK of manufacturers in the thomas register STOP 
START if the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted STOP 
START fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion STOP 
START e STOP 
START UNK the questionnaire each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm STOP 
START the UNK were mailed in UNK washington and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of UNK UNK oregon and washington STOP 
START UNK was used for the addresses outside the pacific northwest STOP 
START each letter contained a UNK return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the pacific northwest and by UNK for those outside the pacific northwest STOP 
START approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a UNK UNK UNK was sent to each of the original names STOP 
START the first test UNK to 14 companies was made in june 1960 STOP 
START the second test UNK to 100 companies was made in july 1960 STOP 
START the final UNK of the questionnaire was made late in august 1960 to UNK firms consisting of UNK from the UNK list and UNK from the UNK list STOP 
START f STOP 
START UNK received over 1,000 returns were received within two weeks after the final UNK was made STOP 
START they continued to arrive until the end of december 1960 by which time a total of UNK returns were received representing UNK per cent of the UNK UNK sent out STOP 
START UNK returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed STOP 
START the remaining UNK returns that were processed came from the categories in table 2 STOP 
START g STOP 
START UNK the returns each questionnaire was UNK for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a UNK number by the source list from which the company name was selected and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the UNK on the return envelope STOP 
START all responses except comments were UNK UNK to permit use of UNK equipment STOP 
START the codes were UNK into UNK UNK cards and UNK STOP 
START each return required three cards and involved key UNK UNK UNK columns STOP 
START in order to be able to properly UNK the data for a single company each of the three cards UNK the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate UNK number of the UNK STOP 
START the cards were then processed using standard UNK UNK card equipment including an UNK UNK computer STOP 
START the first step in processing was to UNK the returns from questions 1 2 and 3 to determine whether the UNK were large businesses or small businesses in accordance with the UNK contained in UNK section UNK STOP 
START see chapter 2 STOP 
START the results are shown in table 3 STOP 
START the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms STOP 
START the second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the UNK list with those from companies on the UNK list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to UNK the responses for the purposes of the study STOP 
START the methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in UNK aj STOP 
START it was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in or UNK to sell to defense programs STOP 
START in the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the UNK list alone STOP

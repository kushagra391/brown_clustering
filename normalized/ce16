START UNK is 23 feet long with an UNK beam and every inch a family boat STOP 
START UNK can ride in the forward cockpit where the UNK has a clear view STOP 
START youngsters can sleep or UNK themselves safely in the large cabin which has UNK UNK UNK bunks for three UNK and marine toilet STOP 
START the UNK can sun themselves in the UNK UNK cockpit STOP 
START all are well distributed not crowded together near the stern STOP 
START and with passenger weight shifted forward UNK levels off for speed under power of a UNK 800 STOP 
START the UNK motor UNK her at 25 UNK with six aboard only two aboard UNK does better than 27 UNK and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a UNK UNK STOP 
START she also banks into a turn like a fine UNK not UNK in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin UNK STOP 
START nor is she a wet boat STOP 
START we've been out in UNK waves and stayed dry STOP 
START a lot of thought went into storage space construction STOP 
START there's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for UNK and other items STOP 
START the cabin has several UNK for small items and storage under the bunks for water UNK life UNK etc. STOP 
START the UNK cockpit has a af storage UNK over six feet long that UNK as a seat STOP 
START on each side of the motor well there's storage for battery UNK line and spare UNK with UNK gas tanks below STOP 
START the well itself is designed to take two UNK UNK or UNK if you wish and there's room for a UNK UNK gas tank below it STOP 
START needless to say you can't build UNK in a couple of weeks STOP 
START our building time was slightly over 400 hours but the total cost for the hull with UNK bottom sink head and hardware was under UNK STOP 
START a comparable manufactured boat would cost close to UNK STOP 
START consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the UNK and your building time is well worth it STOP 
START a UNK trailer model UNK is used to transport the boat to the UNK STOP 
START this piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in UNK and UNK fees in a few years STOP 
START all UNK in UNK is UNK UNK which in the dressed state you buy it is about the 13 thickness specified in the drawings STOP 
START therefore the lumber is bought in UNK and UNK to size for battens etc. on a table saw STOP 
START besides UNK bronze UNK UNK bronze UNK nails made by independent UNK packing co. UNK mass. are used UNK in assembly and UNK UNK UNK is used in all the joints STOP 
START construction follows a thorough study of the drawings STOP 
START start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor STOP 
START draw each outline in a UNK UNK one on top of the other STOP 
START in this way you will be able to UNK any obvious mistakes STOP 
START the transom frame is made first with the joints UNK glued and fastened with UNK no. 12 UNK nails STOP 
START after UNK it for the UNK UNK and battens the UNK UNK transom is secured to it with UNK and the same type nails STOP 
START all frames are UNK at the joints and 3 UNK UNK are glued and nailed on each side of each joint again using the UNK no. 12 nails STOP 
START the frames are UNK only for the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START if UNK for the battens they would require more work be UNK and UNK holes would have to be bored so that UNK water could flow through STOP 
START nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK is erected after the frames and transom are complete STOP 
START this is an important step because any UNK would cause UNK worse UNK in the hull as you advance in construction STOP 
START be sure all members are parallel vertical and level as required STOP 
START after the frames and transom are set up on the UNK and temporarily UNK a piece of UNK UNK only UNK will be given since the 13 thickness is used throughout is UNK between frames one and two below the line of the UNK STOP 
START the frames are glued and screwed to this piece STOP 
START the joints are also UNK on each side with small blocks set in UNK UNK cloth and nailed STOP 
START it is over this piece that the UNK stem and UNK are UNK STOP 
START the UNK made of two UNK UNK is next installed STOP 
START the first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece UNK between frames one and two STOP 
START the second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first STOP 
START note however that it is six inches shorter at the forward end STOP 
START UNK no. 10 UNK are used in both cases STOP 
START a stem UNK is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one STOP 
START the stem is UNK from four pieces STOP 
START take two UNK pieces and UNK them down the center of the thickness to make the four STOP 
START then spread a generous amount of UNK on the four pieces and bend them into place on the UNK STOP 
START the first two pieces butt against the inner member of the UNK and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames STOP 
START the second two pieces lap over the inner member of the UNK and butt against the outer member STOP 
START they're glued and screwed to the inner member of the UNK STOP 
START a number of c UNK hold the pieces together on the UNK until the UNK sets STOP 
START all bottom battens are two inches wide STOP 
START the side ones are a UNK UNK STOP 
START the battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary UNK on all frames STOP 
START UNK and UNK no. 10 UNK are used STOP 
START placement is important because the rear seat bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens STOP 
START with the exception of two battens all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful UNK STOP 
START the UNK go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of UNK wood for strength and easier UNK STOP 
START UNK is always a UNK job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill UNK and a simple UNK STOP 
START i UNK a UNK piece of aluminum to the base of the UNK with a pair of sure UNK STOP 
START the aluminum flush against the battens acted as a UNK stick and enabled me to plane the UNK and UNK to the proper UNK easily STOP 
START if you don't own a UNK and don't want to buy one it's well worth UNK STOP 
START the UNK is UNK 3 UNK royal marine UNK STOP 
START this can be obtained in UNK UNK 24 feet long STOP 
START the UNK width leaves very little waste STOP 
START four pieces are used STOP 
START UNK the sides first using UNK and UNK no. 12 UNK nails at all battens the stem and the transom STOP 
START another person inside with a weight against each UNK will help in the UNK STOP 
START the best procedure is to have a few friends hold the UNK in place while you mark it off STOP 
START then trim the excess STOP 
START i used a UNK UNK made by porter UNK for this job STOP 
START it's good for cutting all the UNK because it cuts with a UNK blade at high UNK and does not UNK the UNK like a UNK saw STOP 
START when cut the UNK is UNK in place for a final and careful UNK STOP 
START then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom frames UNK and all the battens STOP 
START it may then be UNK for the UNK STOP 
START the next step is to remove it and spread UNK where it has been marked at the contact points STOP 
START then it is replaced and fastened STOP 
START the bottom UNK is applied in the same manner STOP 
START after UNK the bottom gets a layer of UNK STOP 
START the spray UNK are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with UNK STOP 
START then the UNK are rounded off and the bottom is UNK in preparation STOP 
START since the sides are also covered up to the spray UNK they are also UNK in that area STOP 
START the cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time STOP 
START a UNK width is used on each side and it UNK the UNK line by about three inches STOP 
START lay the cloth in place and trim it to size STOP 
START then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of UNK STOP 
START when the UNK has hardened mix up another UNK with a UNK added if you wish STOP 
START i used bright red UNK the UNK in thoroughly before adding the UNK STOP 
START using a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with the UNK and then apply the cloth STOP 
START when the cloth is smooth apply another coat of UNK spreading it with a paint UNK STOP 
START be sure it is well UNK and then allow it to UNK STOP 
START when the whole bottom has hardened use a disk UNK to UNK the edges of the cloth at the UNK line and near the spray rail STOP 
START then lay a UNK strip of cloth along the UNK line from the transom to the point of the stem STOP 
START before the UNK has hardened screw a UNK UNK UNK strip along the UNK STOP 
START this UNK the bottom in UNK STOP 
START UNK materials are available from glass plastic supply co. UNK w. elizabeth ave. UNK n. j. STOP 
START they will also supply literature on application STOP 
START the hull is now turned over with the help of about seven friends and placed in a level UNK position STOP 
START i set it on the UNK trailer STOP 
START i laid three UNK of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also UNK a bow eye at this time STOP 
START for added strength i also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and UNK joint STOP 
START again these blocks were set in UNK glass cloth and nailed STOP 
START after UNK off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to UNK them to the UNK at a working height the top of the side UNK is installed STOP 
START this is made up of UNK left over from the sides and bottom STOP 
START these UNK parts really help to keep the boat dry STOP 
START when they're on the top edges are UNK even with the sheer UNK STOP 
START the sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom forming a real strong transom brace STOP 
START note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces STOP 
START the UNK is UNK UNK marine UNK STOP 
START all the UNK and the storage UNK is UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START most floor battens are glued and screwed to the UNK STOP 
START the exception is where the UNK UNK STOP 
START these battens are glued and screwed to the frames STOP 
START with all deck battens in place the UNK is cleaned and painted up to the floor line STOP 
START use one coat of UNK and one coat of marine paint STOP 
START UNK of the UNK are also painted and the UNK is then screwed in place STOP 
START after the UNK is on the cabin sides are installed STOP 
START they're followed by the front and rear UNK as illustrated STOP 
START the UNK glass is UNK and UNK is used in the cabin STOP 
START inside bunks are framed up and installed as indicated STOP 
START a head is a handy thing to have and i installed one under a UNK section of the port bunk STOP 
START the sink in the UNK panel above the bunk UNK into the head and a UNK water tank is mounted on the UNK above the sink STOP 
START for UNK the seats and bunks i used UNK type aj STOP 
START UNK UNK fire UNK and UNK stable it is easily UNK to the wood with contact cement STOP 
START available in af sheets it costs about a dollar a square foot STOP

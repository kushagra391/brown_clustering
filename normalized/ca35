START there are so my UNK friends tell me mechanisms of UNK and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory STOP 
START UNK are a case in point STOP 
START the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the UNK scheme tended to UNK out the possibility of future development STOP 
START though this may or may not be good UNK it does UNK illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education STOP 
START there can be no doubt that the american catholic UNK in the field of higher education is most impressive our european UNK never cease to UNK at the number and the size of our colleges and universities STOP 
START the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by UNK UNK at that STOP 
START by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic UNK and UNK which brought the parochial school system into existence STOP 
START there is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and UNK picture STOP 
START UNK the american catholic educational achievement in UNK we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university STOP 
START but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy STOP 
START official encouragement is one thing but the UNK test is the allocation of UNK and parochial funds STOP 
START american catholics have responded UNK to UNK and UNK appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning STOP 
START they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made STOP 
START UNK authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility STOP 
START all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how UNK authorities could have acted otherwise STOP 
START yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not UNK their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative UNK and UNK of individual religious communities STOP 
START community UNK de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible STOP 
START to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the UNK de corps of the religious community STOP 
START it is something more than the UNK sum of individual UNK of UNK and UNK STOP 
START a religious community with a vital sense of mission UNK a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere STOP 
START the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and UNK by the UNK of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension STOP 
START the net result is a UNK satisfying sense of UNK the kind of UNK which UNK enthusiasm and UNK the cutting edge of sacrifice and UNK STOP 
START american catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious communities STOP 
START had it not been for such private enterprise UNK authorities might of course have been UNK into establishing institutions UNK by UNK funds and parish UNK and UNK by religious as paid employees STOP 
START there is however no point in UNK about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning UNK their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business STOP 
START this UNK spirit is the real explanation of the UNK of our achievement STOP 
START it is this spirit which explains some of the UNK of american catholic higher education in particular the UNK UNK apparent in some areas STOP 
START i think for example of three women's colleges with UNK small UNK UNK within a few miles of a major catholic university which is also UNK STOP 
START this is not an isolated example aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough STOP 
START it would seem to represent UNK de corps run UNK STOP 
START apart however from the question of UNK UNK there is another aspect of the family business spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny STOP 
START for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by UNK institutions which in temper and tone closely UNK junior colleges and UNK schools it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely UNK the university in its pursuit of excellence STOP 
START at the earlier UNK excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conducted on an UNK community basis STOP 
START but with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for UNK becomes more pressing STOP 
START the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for STOP 
START UNK on the earlier stage the UNK UNK chapter of the american association of university professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative UNK noted that the term UNK as opposed to e.g. maintenance employee was a not UNK description STOP 
START today however the UNK is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order otherwise the college would not be interested in UNK him and to be UNK to the democratic processes of the secular or state university STOP 
START and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class UNK drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement STOP 
START in the above mentioned report of the UNK UNK chapter of the american association of university professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty UNK very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it even with the best of intentions he the president of the university is UNK to UNK such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which considered as it must be by him in individual terms is UNK UNK and of extremely varying UNK interests and capabilities STOP 
START it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that UNK phrase the UNK of excellence STOP 
START the pattern here UNK is clearly not peculiar to UNK UNK it is simply that the UNK involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty STOP 
START it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of UNK tension STOP 
START but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one STOP 
START outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business STOP 
START there are two reasons why failure to come to UNK with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university STOP 
START in the first place there is the obvious problem of UNK high UNK personnel STOP 
START word UNK rapidly in the tightly UNK academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences STOP 
START expressions of even UNK UNK by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of UNK the already existing stereotype STOP 
START in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a UNK all that happens is that the better qualified teacher UNK to UNK two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere STOP 
START to appreciate the nature of the UNK it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service STOP 
START much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now UNK firm tenure STOP 
START this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated STOP 
START when a man UNK a block of his years at a university without gaining the UNK promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services STOP 
START a man does not make that kind of UNK if he UNK that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family STOP 
START just as it is possible to UNK the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to UNK the significance of the now relatively adequate UNK paid by major catholic institutions STOP 
START adequate compensation is indispensable STOP 
START yet adequate compensation and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those UNK which cause a man to sacrifice part of his UNK potential by taking up college teaching in the first place STOP 
START UNK speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an UNK but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university STOP 
START religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to UNK both the UNK UNK of UNK and his need for this identification STOP 
START there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels STOP 
START the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal UNK over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution STOP 
START but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation STOP 
START the second reason for being concerned with the UNK between faculty members who are part of the UNK that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the UNK effect on the UNK of the teaching itself STOP 
START this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure STOP 
START yet though it may seem difficult to UNK any UNK resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order STOP 
START the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with UNK titles but no real authority STOP 
START in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be UNK STOP 
START competent teachers are well UNK in the technique of leading students to UNK conclusions without destroying the UNK illusion that they are making their own decisions STOP 
START those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by UNK and UNK decision making STOP 
START in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all STOP 
START in the UNK UNK report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to UNK communication STOP 
START in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to UNK policy i.e. members of the religious community which owns and UNK the institution have their own eating arrangements STOP

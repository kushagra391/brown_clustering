START some years ago UNK UNK proposed to an audience made up of members of the british association for the UNK of science that man's UNK or UNK UNK are now in the same case as were his mathematical UNK during the ice age STOP 
START as a UNK dr. UNK interests himself in the possibilities of human development and one thing we can say about this suggestion which comes from a leading UNK is that so far as he is concerned the scientific outlook places no rigid UNK upon the idea of future human evolution STOP 
START this text from dr. UNK is sometimes used by UNK to indicate that they have the permission of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful UNK of UNK powers in human beings STOP 
START there may be a case of this sort but it is not one we wish to argue here STOP 
START even if people do in a not far distant future begin to read one UNK minds there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind is especially worth reading worth more that is than what you can read in good books STOP 
START even if men eventually find themselves able to look through walls and around corners one may question whether this will help them to live better lives STOP 
START there would be UNK to be drawn of course UNK are impressive evidence pointing to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts of UNK and organic UNK the basic UNK of existence would still be UNK and we should still have to work out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article STOP 
START all we want from dr. UNK statement is the feeling that this is an open world in the view of the best scientific opinion with practically no UNK commitments as to what may happen next and no important UNK with respect to what may be possible STOP 
START it seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human beings arise from the fact that man is not one but many STOP 
START each man that is is both one and many STOP 
START he is a UNK of the good society with a plan to put into effect and he is an individual UNK with something to make for himself and the people of his time STOP 
START he is a parent with a child to UNK here and now and he is an UNK who worries about the children half way round the world STOP 
START he is a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made UNK by the circumstances of today STOP 
START he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself STOP 
START he is a UNK wife who UNK about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a UNK genius who goes boating with the town baker when UNK from the local university have come to call STOP 
START he is the stern UNK of the status quo who has raised the UNK structures of the age and he is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic UNK to UNK for the men he has killed STOP 
START what will be the final UNK of the good society what do the UNK labor on a desk is a UNK of UNK representing the efforts of some of the best men of the day to UNK these questions STOP 
START the UNK are about law the corporation forms of government the idea of freedom the defense of liberty the various UNK which UNK our major institutions the gap between traditional social ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their realization STOP 
START the thing that is notable in all these discussions is the lack of ideological UNK STOP 
START there is another kind of UNK a quiet sure devotion to the fundamental UNK of human life but no angry utopian UNK STOP 
START actually you could wish for some passion now and then but when you look around the world and see the little UNK of current history which partisan social passions have UNK you are glad that in these UNK there is at least some civilized calm STOP 
START you could also say that in these UNK is a UNK quality of maturity STOP 
START there is essential UNK in reading the writing of men who are not angry who can UNK without UNK STOP 
START this is the good kind of UNK and with all our problems and crises this kind of UNK has UNK in the united states during recent years STOP 
START a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry is found in joseph p. UNK introduction to the agreeable UNK a recent UNK study of the institutions of modern democratic society STOP 
START mr. UNK gives voice to a temper that represents we think an achieved UNK of UNK thinking STOP 
START after UNK about for a way of describing this spirit we decided that it would be better to use mr. UNK introduction as an illustration STOP 
START he begins at one time it seemed as if the soviet union had done us a favor by providing a striking example of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations STOP 
START as things turned out however we have not UNK greatly from the lesson instead of UNK following a national program of our own we have often been satisfied to be against whatever soviet policy seemed to be at the moment STOP 
START such activity may or may not have UNK the kremlin but it has frequently condemned america to an UNK UNK that has UNK our effort to give leadership to the free world STOP 
START the UNK has been exaggerated by another bad habit our tendency to rate the goodness or UNK of other nations by the extent to which they UNK the UNK we UNK about ourselves STOP 
START since the UNK have little application to reality and are UNK to boot the applause is faint even in areas of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection for free government STOP 
START shocked at the response to our UNK we grow more defensive and worse we lose our sense of humor and proportion STOP 
START mr. UNK is subjected to stern lectures on UNK by our department of state and an american president UNK UNK that UNK would be a little less UNK if it were a little more UNK STOP 
START one thing you can say about mr. UNK is that he does not suffer from any UNK as an american STOP 
START those who are UNK fear to be UNK in UNK STOP 
START only the strong look squarely at weakness STOP 
START the maturity in this point of view lies in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being clearly understood STOP 
START mr. UNK continues even if the self portrait we UNK for popular consumption were accurate it would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society STOP 
START we would be UNK the special circumstances of other countries STOP 
START the picture is the more UNK when it UNK the facts of american life STOP 
START the discrepancy between what we commonly UNK and what we practice or UNK is great and it does not escape the notice of others STOP 
START if our sincerity is granted and it is granted the discrepancy can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe UNK and legend about ourselves in UNK to an understanding gained by earnest UNK STOP 
START what is more the UNK have become so UNK that the very habit of UNK or UNK UNK of low UNK and men who practice it are UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START although we continue to pay our UNK UNK to free private enterprise individual initiative the democratic way government of the people competition of the UNK etc. we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition is UNK in large areas UNK is UNK representative government technology is UNK the UNK confidence in his own power to make decisions and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically into the ground STOP 
START the interesting thing about mr. UNK approach and the approach of the UNK to the agreeable UNK UNK publications 1961 to the situation of american civilization is that it is concerned with UNK the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect on american life STOP 
START in an ideological argument the UNK tend to UNK the table STOP 
START they are determined to prove something STOP 
START the new spirit so well illustrated by mr. UNK work is wholly free of this anxiety STOP 
START the problem is rather to find out what is actually happening and this is especially difficult for the reason that we are UNK being defended from a knowledge of the present sometimes by the very agencies our educational system our mass media our UNK on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding of ourselves STOP 
START the introduction continues we experience a vague UNK about events a suspicion that our political and economic institutions like the UNK in the bottle have escaped UNK and that we have lost the power to recall them STOP 
START we feel uncomfortable at being UNK by a corporation or a union or a television set but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and what they are doing to us we can hardly learn to control them STOP 
START it does not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles on the national purpose STOP 
START the agreeable UNK is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today STOP 
START the men who UNK on these institutions have for the most part come to at least one common conclusion that many of the great enterprises and associations around which our democracy is formed are in themselves UNK in nature and possessed of power which can be used to UNK the citizen who is trying to assert his UNK in the modern world STOP 
START these institutions which mr. UNK names agreeable UNK where did they come from one thing we can be sure they were not UNK out by the revolutionary UNK of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the free society STOP 
START no doubt there are historians who can explain to a great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth century STOP 
START going back over this ground and UNK the composition of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken by the center for the study of democratic institutions in santa UNK STOP 
START but however we come finally to explain and account for the present the truth we are trying to UNK right now is that the makers of UNK and the designers of institutions find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all their enterprises STOP 
START the host is the flowing life of the human race STOP 
START this life has its own UNK and rhythms its own multiple UNK and UNK STOP 
START on occasion it produces extraordinary UNK STOP 
START should rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory for the UNK of television atomic energy and UNK machines would thomas jefferson feel after reading factories in the field tell us sir that we are free because we have in one hand a ballot and in the other a stock UNK STOP 
START with these we shape our destiny and own private property and that sir makes ours the best of all possible societies STOP 
START the reality of the situation however is described by mr. UNK many of us may even be UNK relieved at having a UNK excuse to UNK ancient civic responsibilities to a new UNK of experts STOP 
START thus the member of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business agents who may proceed without interference or recall UNK UNK his UNK the citizen UNK his political participation to the mere act of voting if he votes at all STOP

START furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible STOP 
START the instrument is shown in fig. 1 and consists essentially of a hard sharp UNK UNK knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating STOP 
START the force required to accomplish removal is UNK by means of an electronic UNK against distance of removal STOP 
START since the removal force is a function of coating thickness a differential UNK pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness STOP 
START this too is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut STOP 
START a number of adjustment features are included in the UNK to UNK measurement and permit ready removal of coatings UNK on such UNK as iron and other UNK glass wood and plastic surfaces STOP 
START the measurement of UNK on UNK can also readily be carried out STOP 
START UNK results have been found to compare UNK with UNK knife scratching tests STOP 
START the instrumental method however is about 100 times more sensitive and UNK numerical results which can be accurately repeated at will over a period of time STOP 
START if a UNK coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the UNK with a knife of constant rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating STOP 
START at low UNK a cutting or UNK phenomenon is often encountered STOP 
START as the coating becomes UNK the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure STOP 
START if the coating becomes still UNK a UNK type failure finally can occur STOP 
START the typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in figs. 2 3 and 4 which are single frame UNK of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process STOP 
START it can be seen from fig. 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating STOP 
START the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface STOP 
START the pictures of figs. 3 and 4 show the cracking and UNK types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at or close to the UNK between coating and substrate STOP 
START if the force required to remove the coatings is UNK against film thickness a graph as illustrated UNK in fig. 5 may UNK result STOP 
START here h is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and t is the film thickness STOP 
START it can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to UNK removal STOP 
START also it can be readily seen that the cutting and UNK types of failure show a steady state response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature STOP 
START it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating UNK upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness STOP 
START presumably the UNK bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case STOP 
START what then are the factors that contribute to these phenomena should the practical UNK of a coating as UNK by a knife method change initially increasing rather rapidly and then UNK UNK to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness mechanism of cohesive failure the cutting or UNK removal process has been previously described STOP 
START it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure STOP 
START the details of the removal process are shown UNK in fig. 6 STOP 
START the various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane which makes an angle UNK with the substrate STOP 
START the action and reaction forces are r and af respectively and are equal and opposite in direction STOP 
START all the other force UNK are derived from these STOP 
START af is the force required to cut a coating of thickness t from the substrate STOP 
START af is the shear force along the shear plane and af are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife respectively is the normal UNK force acting on the shear plane is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the knife STOP 
START UNK is the rake angle of the knife is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate is the friction angle UNK is the angle the UNK make with the plane of the substrate STOP 
START an analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle UNK and the friction angle UNK determine the vector direction af of the force UNK r and af STOP 
START consequently both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process STOP 
START it is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of r directly STOP 
START in actual practice the values most readily UNK to measurement are the cutting force af and the shear angle aj STOP 
START these two values and the rake angle UNK are sufficient to determine the other UNK of these relationships STOP 
START UNK is defined by the UNK of the knife can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate is UNK determined STOP 
START from fig. 6 the relationship between these UNK can readily be derived and the cutting force is af where UNK is the shear strength of the coating and is a UNK of the coatings material UNK is the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness STOP 
START if the cutting force af is UNK against film thickness a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope af STOP 
START however in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods for any thickness of coating a number of UNK effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by UNK 1 STOP 
START UNK knife one of these is the fact that the knife employed no matter how well UNK will have a slightly rounded cutting edge STOP 
START this UNK that UNK the rake angle is no longer a constant to zero film thickness STOP 
START the UNK of this UNK is in the case of the UNK knife employed in the UNK determined by the grain sizes of the polished UNK and the UNK UNK UNK UNK together in the knife body and is in the order of UNK to UNK UNK STOP 
START the force vector concept of fig. 6 can readily be applied to this condition also STOP 
START because the rake angle af at the tip of the knife is very much smaller or even negative when compared to the value of UNK for the major portion of the knife a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result STOP 
START this UNK to the relationship af where af is the UNK at zero thickness of the UNK of the slope indicated in UNK 1 af is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the UNK off of the knife tip af is a straight line first UNK of this UNK and the other symbols are equivalent to those of UNK 1 STOP 
START it can be seen that af is a constant and is determined for the most part by the UNK of the knife STOP 
START the UNK the knife the higher is the value of af STOP 
START the importance of a hard UNK knife material like the UNK employed in the UNK immediately becomes apparent STOP 
START UNK UNK would UNK very rapidly making the value of af UNK STOP 
START in extreme cases of very soft UNK this value may even change during the course of a measurement STOP 
START knife friction a second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the UNK determined cutting force is the UNK resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate STOP 
START this is not a constant value like af but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the UNK r and af of fig. 6 STOP 
START under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip UNK a thrust af against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of af STOP 
START the resultant friction force af is thus directly proportional to af and consequently also to film thickness STOP 
START the value of af can readily be UNK by determining the UNK force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external UNK STOP 
START a straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of af against load l having slope UNK and af STOP 
START since the load l under actual cutting conditions is caused by af it can be seen that af STOP 
START the measured force h in cutting removal of coatings from their UNK consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating af that due to the UNK of the knife af and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate af or af STOP 
START the first two forces are directly UNK and depend upon film thickness whereas af is independent of these two and is a constant for a given knife combination STOP 
START these theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in fig. 7 and their sum can be seen to UNK in form with practical measurements made with the UNK as illustrated in the first portion of fig. 5 for the cutting mechanism STOP 
START UNK mechanism of cohesive failure although a large number of coatings systems particularly at low UNK fail UNK by the cutting mechanism frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place STOP 
START this is a UNK dynamic type failure encountered with very UNK coatings UNK or very highly UNK films STOP 
START this is shown in the UNK of fig. 8 STOP 
START the basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the UNK mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without UNK UNK UNK occurs along the shear plane STOP 
START the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied UNK by merchant for metal cutting and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings STOP 
START by studying high speed movies made of this type of failure the sequence of relationships as UNK illustrated in fig. 9 could be observed STOP 
START in the first picture UNK the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation STOP 
START in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to the inclined work surface STOP 
START with increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly UNK STOP 
START eventually UNK occurs along the shear plane UNK and the cycle UNK itself STOP 
START merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the UNK and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the UNK chip formation provided the proper values of UNK shear angle and UNK chip thickness or UNK area are used STOP 
START consequently if the shear angle UNK is replaced by the UNK angle af the relationships as described in UNK 1 2 4 and 6 will directly apply STOP 
START the cracking mechanism under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip UNK a force af against the coating and an equal opposite force af against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in fig. 6 STOP 
START if the rake angle UNK of the knife is high enough and the friction angle UNK between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for af the resultant vector r will lie above the plane of the substrate STOP

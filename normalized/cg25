START for this change is not a change from one positive position to another but a change from order and truth to UNK and UNK STOP 
START the UNK division we might observe in passing is not of itself directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between ruling groups STOP 
START rather it is UNK in a difference of response to the threat of social UNK STOP 
START the division is not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change STOP 
START rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways of thought with regard to man's life in society STOP 
START these ways are absolutely UNK because they offer two different UNK for man's UNK from chaos STOP 
START the UNK crisis the third type of change raises the question what are we to do the most primitive level STOP 
START for the answer cannot be derived from any socially cohesive element in the UNK community STOP 
START there is no socially UNK answer to the question STOP 
START for the truth formerly experienced by the community no longer has UNK status in the community nor does any answer UNK by UNK or UNK STOP 
START in this phase of change no idea has social acceptance and so none has UNK status in the community STOP 
START an UNK UNK in which not men but ideas compete for existence STOP 
START if we examine the three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two one that accounts for the notable difference between the responses they UNK STOP 
START the first two types of change occur within the UNK and UNK structure of the society STOP 
START the first involves a simple shift of interests in the society STOP 
START the second involves something deeper but its characteristic form UNK on a shift in policy for the community not in the truth on which the community rests STOP 
START thus in both types attention is focused on the community itself and its UNK life STOP 
START the third type however UNK attention from the life of action and interests in the community and UNK it on the ground of being on which the community depends for its existence STOP 
START UNK has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable healthy community STOP 
START there the community faced with the need to UNK policy on the level of absolute justice can find the answer to its problem in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced STOP 
START this however cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth is confused and UNK it has no absolute standard and consequently cannot distinguish the absolute from the UNK STOP 
START it has lost its ground of being and UNK in a mist of appearances STOP 
START UNK and equality are its characteristic diseases STOP 
START precisely at the moment when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out from itself in a search for the UNK standard whereby it can measure itself STOP 
START for UNK history breaks rather than UNK precisely when the movement is from order to UNK and not from one order to a new order STOP 
START the UNK split to define it further UNK from a basic difference concerning the UNK status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads to its identification STOP 
START when UNK change has UNK to the third level of social order the process of UNK rapidly reaches a point of no return STOP 
START indeed it is probable that this point is reached the moment the third level of change begins STOP 
START at that point we reach the closed historical situation the situation in which man is no longer free to return to a status quo UNK STOP 
START at that point men become aware of the mystery of history called UNK fate or destiny or providence and feel themselves caught UNK in the UNK of a UNK society STOP 
START the reasons for this experience are UNK in the metaphysical characteristics of such a change STOP 
START of all forms of being society or community has the greatest element of UNK STOP 
START its UNK status is itself most UNK because apart from individual men who are its matter tradition the form of society exists only as a shared perception of truth STOP 
START the UNK status of society thus is constituted by the psychological status of UNK members STOP 
START the content of that psychological status determines ultimately the content of civilization STOP 
START those social UNK factors not UNK in the human spirit of the group ultimately cease to exist STOP 
START civilization itself tradition falls out of existence when the human spirit itself becomes confused STOP 
START civilization is what man has made of himself STOP 
START its massive contours are UNK in the simple need of man since he is always incomplete to complete himself STOP 
START it is not enough for man to be an UNK UNK STOP 
START he needs UNK completion he needs that is to move in the direction of completion STOP 
START and the direction of that movement is determined by his perception of the truth about himself STOP 
START he must consequently exist as a UNK UNK developing agent or he does not exist as man STOP 
START thus it is no UNK intuition but an UNK conception to say that man and his tradition can fall out of existence STOP 
START this happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance in himself of a nature that in UNK words is perceived as a UNK of intelligible necessities STOP 
START an UNK is a man who UNK himself only as UNK as existence without substance STOP 
START thus human perception and human UNK is the UNK cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches the UNK level STOP 
START thus with regard to the loss of tradition in the change from order to UNK the metaphysics of change works itself out as a UNK of the individual soul a change in which man continues as an objective UNK UNK but no longer as a man STOP 
START further change is a form of motion it occurs as the act of a being in UNK UNK as it is in UNK and has not yet reached the UNK of the change STOP 
START with regard to the change we are UNK the question is at what point does the change become UNK number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in the process STOP 
START change involves the displacement of form STOP 
START this means that the UNK of change itself can begin only when the factors UNK to change have already become more powerful than those UNK the UNK form in being STOP 
START if the UNK form is to be retained new factors that UNK it must be introduced into the situation STOP 
START in the case of social decay form is UNK simply by the process of UNK with no form at the UNK of the process STOP 
START now in the mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have UNK evidence of the UNK weakness of the UNK form STOP 
START and when we consider the UNK hold tradition has on existence any UNK of that hold constitutes a crisis of existence STOP 
START the retention of a tradition confronted with such a crisis UNK the introduction of new spiritual forces into the situation STOP 
START however the crisis occurs precisely as a UNK of spiritual forces STOP 
START it would seem therefore that in a UNK crisis man cannot save himself STOP 
START the UNK of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a UNK for the victory of UNK STOP 
START and it would seem that history is a witness to this truth STOP 
START as a further UNK of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for UNK UNK in history STOP 
START these differences in turn derive from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character of change STOP 
START UNK responses anxiety and deep UNK are the characteristic responses UNK by the crisis in tradition STOP 
START to experience them it is not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what is happening to it STOP 
START the process of UNK need only UNK the tradition and a series of consequences begin UNK within the individual while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation of processes occurs STOP 
START within the individual the reaction has been called various names all however pointing to the same basic experience STOP 
START UNK UNK it as being UNK UNK as being UNK UNK as being lonely STOP 
START others call it alienation and mean by that no simple economic experience as UNK does but a deep spiritual sense of UNK STOP 
START within institutions there is a marked decline of the process of UNK and the UNK of a UNK process which UNK as the earlier one of UNK STOP 
START we note the use of UNK as a weapon the UNK of the masses by propaganda the UNK of effort and resources STOP 
START within this context of spontaneous and UNK responses to the experience of UNK crisis two basic organizations of response are UNK reaction and ideological UNK STOP 
START these responses are UNK in terms of characteristics inherent in the crisis STOP 
START both are UNK UNK to fail STOP 
START the response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is UNK STOP 
START its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through the UNK of UNK forces STOP 
START to this end political authority is called upon to exercise its negative and UNK powers STOP 
START the implicit assumption of this response is that history is UNK STOP 
START seemingly order is perceived as a kind of UNK UNK now covered by UNK UNK STOP 
START the problem is to remove the UNK and thereby UNK the order that was always there STOP 
START such a response of course UNK the point that in crisis order is going out of existence STOP 
START moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is UNK to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the UNK form of order once the UNK of change has reached visible proportions STOP 
START the most reaction can achieve is UNK and a UNK that can be maintained only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately UNK itself STOP 
START despite the UNK of the response it is UNK in terms of the crisis of tradition itself STOP 
START since a UNK crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling class reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves to be among the ruling class STOP 
START their great error is to UNK the responses typical of each of the three types of change STOP 
START since UNK change is the most difficult to perceive and UNK it seldom is given adequate attention STOP 
START and the anxiety it UNK is UNK as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status STOP 
START the basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its realistic assumption of the UNK of the real over the UNK STOP 
START but this truth is distorted by its extreme application the assumption of the separate existence of tradition STOP 
START the reactionary UNK the point that tradition exists UNK only in the form of UNK relations STOP 
START reactionary theories for this reason usually assume some form of UNK theory STOP 
START in its defensive formulations the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of the independent existence of the community STOP 
START in its dynamic form it UNK the community as the UNK of an UNK force the race for instance which UNK in history STOP 
START in both cases the individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality STOP 
START when the reactionary response is thus UNK by an intellectual defense the characteristics of that defense are UNK only in terms of the basic attitudes of UNK reaction STOP 
START reaction is UNK in a perception of tradition as a whole STOP 
START it is a total situation that is defended the good old days STOP 
START there is no UNK the UNK features of the past are defended STOP 
START the point is that the reactionary for whatever motive UNK himself to have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself something which consequently he was not able to accept or UNK on the basis of subjective UNK STOP 
START the reactionary is confused about the UNK status of a UNK tradition but he does perceive the unity tradition had when it was healthy STOP

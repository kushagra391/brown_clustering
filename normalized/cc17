START the department of agriculture averaged out u.s. food consumption last year at UNK UNK per person which allowing for the 17 million americans that john kennedy said go to bed hungry every night means that certain UNK on the upper end must somehow down 8 UNK or more a day STOP 
START that mother hen of the UNK tables the metropolitan life insurance co. UNK that UNK million americans are UNK STOP 
START through previous centuries eating changed by nearly UNK degrees and mostly toward just getting enough STOP 
START now big forces UNK food STOP 
START for the first time in history the u.s. has produced a society in which less than UNK of the people turn out so much food that the government's most embarrassing problem is how to UNK UNK of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce STOP 
START in this same society the plain citizen can with an average of only UNK his income buy more UNK than he can UNK STOP 
START refrigeration UNK processing and UNK UNK to UNK season and UNK UNK STOP 
START and in the wake of the new UNK and the new techniques of processing comes a new american interest in how what people eat affects their health STOP 
START to eat is human the nation is learning to think to survive divine STOP 
START UNK facts not all the concern for health is well directed STOP 
START from the UNK UNK of UNK eggs and UNK the u.s. has progressed to UNK UNK and UNK STOP

START UNK stores sell dozens of foods that UNK of having almost no food value at all STOP 
START but a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health and a big group of u.s. scientists wants to supply them STOP 
START the man most firmly at UNK with the problem is the university of UNK UNK UNK keys UNK UNK of the UNK UNK for keys UNK and author of last year's UNK eat well and stay well STOP

START UNK findings though far from complete are likely to UNK many an eating UNK STOP 
START UNK eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on though UNK milk is still the ticket STOP 
START readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in UNK heart attacks are becoming as routine as the UNK which can show that the heart has suffered a UNK attack STOP 
START already many an american knows his count and UNK or worries depending on whether it is nearer UNK safe or 250 dangerous STOP 
START out of cholesterol come UNK main messages so far americans eat too much STOP 
START the typical u.s. daily UNK says dr. keys contains UNK UNK should contain UNK STOP

START UNK new england regarded UNK as a UNK symbol of UNK and thus a sin STOP 
START says keys maybe if the idea got around again that UNK is UNK the fat man would start to think STOP 
START UNK aside the fat man has plenty to worry about over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him STOP 
START the simple mechanical strain of UNK says new UNK dr. norman UNK can UNK and damage the heart for much the same reason that a UNK engine in a UNK body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built STOP 
START the fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher UNK STOP 
START he has for UNK reasons a UNK higher death rate from cancer STOP 
START he is particularly vulnerable to UNK STOP 
START he may find even moderate physical UNK uncomfortable because excess body fat UNK his breathing and UNK his muscular movement STOP 
START UNK people UNK because what dr. UNK calls the UNK is set too high STOP

START food for frustration STOP 
START UNK more frequently UNK is the result of a psychological UNK STOP

START reports dr. keys a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more STOP

START that remarkable cholesterol STOP 
START UNK his personal UNK for UNK UNK dr. keys has only an UNK interest in how much americans eat STOP 
START what concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's no. 1 killer UNK artery disease which accounts for more than half of all heart UNK and UNK UNK americans a year twice the toll from all UNK of cancer five times the UNK from automobile UNK STOP 
START cholesterol the UNK of dr. UNK theory is a mysterious UNK UNK substance UNK a UNK alcohol STOP 
START scientists assume that cholesterol from the greek UNK meaning UNK and UNK meaning solid is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells since it accounts for about UNK of the UNK total solid weight STOP 
START they know it is the chief UNK in UNK STOP 
START they suspect it plays a role in the production of UNK UNK and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the UNK system STOP 
START but they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver STOP 
START although the UNK protein UNK carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol are water UNK cholesterol itself is insoluble and cannot be destroyed by the body STOP 
START a remarkable substance says dr. keys quite apart from its tendency to be UNK in the walls of arteries STOP 
START when thus UNK keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the UNK UNK that UNK in heart attacks STOP 
START explains keys as the UNK protein UNK travel in the UNK they are UNK in the UNK or inner wall of a UNK artery STOP 
START the proteins and fats are burned off and the cholesterol is left behind STOP 
START as cholesterol UNK up it UNK UNK and UNK the artery encouraging formation of calcium UNK and UNK circulation STOP 
START eventually says keys one of two things happens STOP 
START a UNK forms at the site UNK off the flow of blood to the heart and UNK a heart attack STOP 
START or more commonly thinks keys the UNK themselves get so big that they UNK off the UNK flow to the point that an UNK occurs the heart muscle is UNK cells supplied by the artery die and the heart is permanently perhaps UNK injured STOP 
START fats UNK STOP 
START UNK the human liver UNK only enough cholesterol to satisfy the UNK needs for transportation of fats and for production of UNK STOP 
START even eggs and other UNK foods eaten in normal amounts says dr. keys do not UNK affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood STOP 
START but UNK foods do STOP 
START during world war 2 doctors in the UNK and UNK noted a curious fact despite the stresses of nazi occupation the death rate from UNK artery disease was slowly dropping STOP 
START not until long after the war 1950 in fact did they get a UNK of the reason STOP 
START that year UNK UNK UNK showed that the UNK death rate neatly UNK with increasingly severe restrictions on UNK foods STOP 
START that same year the university of UNK dr. UNK UNK timing oxidation rates of blood fats stumbled onto the discovery that many UNK fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically while animal fats cause them to rise STOP 
START here keys and others such as dr. a. e. UNK of the rockefeller institute took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between UNK and animal fats and even between different UNK of each STOP 
START all natural food fats fall into one of three categories UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the degree of UNK depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat UNK STOP 
START UNK fats can accommodate no more UNK STOP 
START UNK fats have room for two more UNK on each UNK and the UNK fat UNK has room for at least four UNK STOP 
START the three fats have similar UNK values about UNK UNK per UNK but each UNK a radically different influence on blood cholesterol STOP

START these societies can expect to face difficult times STOP 
START as the historic processes of modernization gradually gain momentum their UNK will be threatened by UNK forces the UNK between UNK and subjects town and country will UNK UNK for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence UNK may lose their nerve and their sense of direction STOP 
START national leaders will have to display the highest skills of UNK to guide their people through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's sense of identity STOP 
START feelings of a community of interest will have to be UNK in some of the new nations indeed they must be built for the first time on a new basis which looks toward the future and does not rely only on shared memories of the past STOP 
START nevertheless with UNK and careful planning some of the more UNK and dangerous consequences of social change which have troubled other countries passing through this stage can be escaped STOP 
START the united states can help by UNK a genuine concern with the problems these countries face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms of assistance where possible STOP 
START our central goal should be to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to UNK UNK the tasks which they face STOP 
START at the same time we should recognize that the UNK to change and the lack of UNK and stability which UNK these countries may make them particularly prone to UNK and external adventures of all sorts STOP 
START it may seem to some of them that success can be purchased much less UNK by fishing in the UNK waters of international politics than by facing up to the UNK tasks at home STOP 
START we should do what we can to UNK this conclusion both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by UNK firmly to UNK actions on the world scene STOP 
START when necessary we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal advantages from the cold war or to UNK their potential for UNK the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but also risk their own prospects for orderly development STOP 
START as a nation we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development this obligation UNK only to countries which are honestly seeking to become responsible members of a stable and UNK world community STOP 
START UNK societies when we look at countries like UNK UNK UNK and burma where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital and where institutions of UNK government exist we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different UNK for policy STOP 
START the men in power are committed in principle to modernization but economic and social changes are proceeding only UNK STOP 
START isolated enterprises have been launched but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern STOP 
START the society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly UNK urban sector and a relatively UNK rural sector with very poor communications between the two STOP 
START progress is UNK by psychological UNK to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources human and material can be UNK to achieve the national goals of modernization already UNK accepted STOP 
START most countries in this second category share the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political and social system without the modern standards of performance required to make them effective STOP 
START in these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals STOP 
START the colonial period has generally left people believing that government can if it wishes provide all manner of services for them and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the benefits of modern life STOP 
START for example in accordance with the fashion of the times most UNK societies have announced economic development plans of varying numbers of years is the UNK of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement STOP 
START the civil services in such societies are generally inadequate to deal UNK with the problems facing them their members often UNK a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice UNK and competence STOP 
START american policy should press constantly the view that until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their UNK there is not the slightest hope that they will either UNK of UNK their societies STOP 
START we should spread the view that planning and national development are serious matters which call for effort as well as enthusiasm STOP 
START above all we should seek to encourage the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they are responsible for their UNK STOP 
START only within the framework of a mature relationship characterized by honest UNK of performance can we provide telling assistance STOP 
START with respect to those countries whose leaders prefer to live with their UNK we can afford to wait for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see STOP 
START our technical assistance to these countries should place special emphasis on UNK the central governments to assume the role of UNK and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts assumed in dealing with the central governments STOP 
START we should encourage the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities state and UNK governments rural communities and other smaller groups making certain that no important UNK of the economy is neglected STOP 
START simultaneously we should be UNK the UNK of technical progress in various fields showing how agricultural training can be introduced into education how health affects labor productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community and above all how progress in each field UNK to national progress STOP 
START efforts such as the community development program in the UNK have demonstrated that UNK societies can work toward balanced national development STOP 
START to achieve this goal of balanced development communications between the central government and the local communities must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves are effectively taken into account STOP 
START if modernization programs are imposed from above without the understanding and cooperation of the people they will encounter grave difficulties STOP 
START land reform is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries STOP 
START it should be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to UNK the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and modernization of the society STOP 
START as an isolated policy land reform is likely to be politically UNK part of a larger development effort however it may gain wide acceptance STOP 
START it should also be recognized that the problem of rural UNK cannot be solved by administrative UNK alone STOP 
START land reform programs need to be UNK with programs for promoting rural UNK and technical assistance in agriculture STOP 
START UNK governmental and private planners will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements UNK ahead STOP 
START by holding out prospects for external capital assistance the united states can provide strong UNK to prepare for the UNK economic drive necessary to achieve UNK growth STOP 
START actively UNK societies at a third stage in the modernization process are such countries as india UNK the UNK and UNK which are ready and committed to move into the stage of UNK growth STOP 
START they must continue to satisfy basic capital needs there UNK the UNK problem of maintaining operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously UNK participation in the program to wider and wider groups STOP 
START but these countries have made big UNK toward developing the necessary human and social overhead capital have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local levels they have begun to develop a capacity to deal UNK and simultaneously with all the major UNK of their UNK STOP 
START on the economic front the first priority of these countries is to UNK a UNK increased volume of resources STOP 
START several related tasks must be carried out if UNK growth is to be achieved STOP 
START these countries must UNK a comprehensive long-term program covering the objectives of both the private and the public UNK of the economy STOP 
START they must in their planning be able to count on at least tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods of several years STOP 
START capital imports drawn from a number of sources must be employed and combined UNK enough to permit domestic investment UNK to go forward STOP 
START capital UNK must be coordinated with national needs and planning STOP 
START finally a balance must be effected among project finance UNK of agricultural UNK and general balance of payments support STOP 
START thus although the UNK of external assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative and many of the policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant the basic purpose of american economic policy during the later stages of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of UNK growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange STOP 
START there remain many political and administrative problems to be solved STOP 
START for one thing although considerable numbers of men have been trained UNK are still UNK in many respects the UNK indian civil service is not fully adequate to the tremendous range of tasks it has undertaken STOP 
START technical assistance in training UNK and UNK management personnel is still needed in many cases STOP 
START there are also more basic problems STOP 
START this is the stage at which democratic developments must take place if the society is to become an open community of creative people STOP 
START nevertheless impulses still exist among the ruling elite to UNK and thus to UNK the need for UNK and UNK practices STOP 
START another great danger is that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly UNK from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism STOP 
START the capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional classes to contribute UNK to national development is likely to be destroyed by a UNK sense of UNK toward both their own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts in the west STOP 
START particularly when based upon a single dominant party governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of understanding about the national interest STOP 
START convinced of the wisdom of their own actions and UNK by the promises of their economic development programs governments may fail to push UNK to win more and more people to the national effort becoming instead more rigid and UNK in their policies STOP 
START american policy toward such societies should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional classes STOP 
START it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers and UNK of UNK open and UNK societies STOP 
START we have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries also have in consequence the duty to UNK UNK and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways STOP 
START the time factor we have emphasized that the UNK process in each society will take a considerable period of time STOP 
START with the exception of UNK foreign relations were historically concerned for the most part with conditions of short or at least UNK duration STOP 
START foreign policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at UNK STOP 
START american and UNK policies can UNK affect the pace of transition basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in the human attitudes political institutions and social structure which each society must UNK STOP 
START it follows that any effective policy toward the UNK countries must have a UNK long working horizon STOP 
START it must be marked by a patience and UNK which have not always been its UNK STOP 
START this condition affects not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy especially in the context of economic aid STOP

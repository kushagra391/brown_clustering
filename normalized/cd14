START to what extent and in what ways did christianity affect the united states of america in the nineteenth century far and in what fashion did it UNK the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces UNK the revolutionary age what extent did it UNK the UNK and the social economic and political life and institutions of the country complete picture is impossible partly because of the limitations of space partly because for millions of individuals who UNK UNK to the christian faith data are UNK STOP 
START even more of an UNK is the difficulty of UNK the influence of christianity from other factors STOP 
START although a complete picture cannot be given we can indicate some aspects of life into which the christian faith entered as at least one creative factor STOP 
START at times we can say that it was the major factor STOP 
START what in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation STOP 
START as we have seen a growing proportion although in UNK still a minority were members of churches STOP 
START presumably those who did not have a formal church UNK had also felt the influence of christianity to a greater or lesser extent STOP 
START many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the UNK to UNK STOP 
START the form of christianity to which they were exposed was for some the protestantism of the older stock for others the protestantism of the nineteenth-century UNK still others mostly of the nineteenth-century UNK it was roman UNK and for a small minority it was eastern UNK STOP 
START upon all of them played the intellectual social political and economic attitudes institutions and customs of the nation STOP 
START upon most of these christianity had left an UNK and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was STOP 
START yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of christianity would be impossible STOP 
START at best only an UNK could be arrived at STOP 
START to UNK for the entire nation would be absurd STOP 
START for instance we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose STOP 
START the temptation is to say that as the percentage of church members mounted the degree of discipline exercised by the churches UNK and the trend was towards conformity to the general level STOP 
START yet this cannot be proved STOP 
START we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregations took positive action against members who UNK the ethical codes to which the majority UNK STOP 
START thus baptist churches on the frontier took UNK of charges against their members of UNK fighting UNK gossip lying UNK sexual UNK gambling horse racing and failure to pay just debts STOP 
START if guilty the UNK might be UNK from membership STOP 
START as church membership UNK such measures faded into UNK STOP 
START but whether this was accompanied by a general UNK of the moral life of the membership we do not know STOP 
START what we can attempt with some hope of UNK conclusions is to point out the manner in which christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation STOP 
START we have already UNK at the fashion in which christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life STOP 
START we will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it UNK efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements through UNK for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standards and through leaders in the government STOP 
START throughout the nineteenth century christianity exerted its influence on american society as a whole primarily through the protestantism of the older stock STOP 
START by the end of the century the roman catholic church was beginning to make itself felt mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized UNK STOP 
START in the twentieth century its influence grew as did that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century UNK STOP 
START the american dream the ideals of the country were deeply UNK to the protestantism of the older stock STOP 
START thus america the most widely sung of the UNK songs was written by a new england baptist UNK samuel francis smith UNK while a student in UNK theological UNK STOP 
START with its UNK for liberty and its dependence on god it UNK the spirit which had been UNK on the UNK UNK STOP 
START the great seal of the united states was obviously inspired by the christian faith STOP 
START here was what was called the american dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could UNK it STOP 
START later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of UNK lee UNK UNK daughter and UNK of new england congregational ministers in her widely sung UNK written in UNK america the beautiful with the words o beautiful for UNK feet whose stern UNK stress a UNK for freedom beat across the wilderness STOP 
START america america god UNK thy every UNK confirm thy soul in self control the liberty in law STOP 
START o beautiful for UNK dream that sees beyond the years UNK UNK cities UNK UNK by human tears STOP 
START america america god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with UNK from sea to shining sea STOP 
START the american dream was compounded of many UNK STOP 
START some were clearly of christian origin among them the great UNK and other UNK which helped to make christian liberty christian equality and christian UNK the passion of the land STOP 
START some have seen UNK and the search for christian perfection as the UNK of the american hope STOP 
START here too must be placed UNK and less obviously from christian UNK UNK UNK and the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START we must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth among them UNK UNK and henry james the elder all of them out of a christian background STOP 
START reform movements with such a dream arising at least in part from the protestant heritage of the united states and built into the foundations of the nation it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression STOP 
START a number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social UNK STOP 
START significantly the UNK and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century came from men and women of new england birth or UNK and from either UNK or UNK UNK STOP 
START several of the movements were given a marked UNK by UNK STOP 
START UNK some from new england had a larger share than their UNK numerical strength would have UNK STOP 
START we do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of new england UNK also issued the church of jesus christ of latter day UNK the seventh day UNK christian science the american board of commissioners for foreign missions the american home missionary society the american bible society and new england theology STOP 
START the atmosphere was one of optimism of confidence in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of its UNK STOP 
START the UNK universal UNK UNK although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election inspired its UNK to heroic UNK for others looked for the early coming of the UNK and was UNK by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the UNK UNK and the UNK STOP 
START we should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the UNK UNK of the british UNK and the UNK of the continent of europe among them prison reform anti-slavery measures legislation for the UNK of conditions of UNK the inner mission and the red cross STOP 
START we cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or UNK of collective UNK STOP 
START a few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete UNK and description would UNK STOP 
START several were born in the early decades and UNK throughout the century STOP 
START others were UNK STOP 
START some disappeared with the UNK of their purpose STOP 
START still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age STOP 
START the anti-slavery movement the movement to end negro slavery began before UNK and mounted after that year until as a result of the civil war emancipation was achieved STOP 
START long before UNK the christian conscience was leading some to UNK slavery wrong and to act accordingly STOP 
START for example in UNK the philadelphia yearly meeting of friends declared that its members should UNK their slaves and in UNK it determined to UNK from membership all who did not UNK STOP 
START in the latter year samuel UNK from whom the UNK strain of new england theology took its name asked the continental congress to UNK slavery STOP 
START as we have seen UNK early took a stand against slavery STOP 
START beginning at least as far back as UNK various baptist bodies condemned slavery STOP 
START after UNK anti-slavery sentiment mounted chiefly among protestants and those of protestant background of the older stock STOP 
START the nineteenth-century UNK whether protestant or roman catholic was not so much concerned for very few if any among them held slaves they were mostly in the northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out or were too UNK to own slaves STOP 
START the anti-slavery movement took many forms STOP 
START benjamin UNK UNK a UNK was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies STOP 
START it was he who turned the attention of william UNK UNK UNK to the subject STOP 
START UNK massachusetts born of UNK UNK UNK was by UNK and conviction a UNK STOP 
START chiefly remembered because of his UNK UNK of immediate and UNK UNK he also UNK a great variety of other causes among them women's rights prohibition and justice to the indians STOP 
START UNK optimistic UNK and utterly UNK in his youth a UNK baptist in spite of his friendship for the UNK poet john UNK UNK UNK he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their UNK UNK on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was UNK UNK and denied the UNK UNK of the bible STOP 
START a marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK himself while opposed to slavery placed his chief emphasis on UNK but from his UNK issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign STOP 
START theodore dwight UNK UNK was especially active STOP 
START UNK was the son and UNK of new england congregational ministers STOP 
START as a youth he became one of UNK band of UNK and gave himself to winning young men STOP 
START a strong UNK advocate through the influence of a favorite teacher charles UNK another UNK convert he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause STOP 
START a group of young men influenced by him UNK in lane theological UNK and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position STOP 
START the majority then went to the infant UNK STOP 
START they and others employed some of UNK techniques as they sought to win UNK to the cause STOP 
START UNK contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as UNK r. UNK and edwin m. UNK enlisted john UNK adams and helped provide ideas which UNK UNK UNK UNK uncle UNK cabin STOP 
START he UNK publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame STOP 
START UNK phillips UNK from a prominent massachusetts family in his UNK was converted under the preaching of UNK UNK STOP 
START although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were UNK UNK against social UNK he remained a UNK christian STOP 
START he was remembered chiefly for his UNK UNK of UNK but he also stood for equal rights for women for opportunity for the UNK and for prohibition STOP 
START the anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and UNK were given leadership and financial UNK by arthur UNK UNK and his younger brother lewis UNK UNK STOP

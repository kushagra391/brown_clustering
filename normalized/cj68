START recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and UNK content to show as m. d. UNK has said of dickens generally that much of the UNK impact UNK in its UNK insight and moral UNK STOP 
START j. h. UNK excellent chapter on great expectations has lately illustrated how UNK that novel can be read from such a perspective STOP 
START in his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an idea generally neglected in discussions of the book which i believe is central to its art the importance of human hands as a UNK feature of the narrative STOP 
START this essay UNK to make that exploration STOP 
START dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great UNK writers STOP 
START he knew UNK that next to voice and face an UNK hands are his most useful possession that in fiction as in the theatre gesture is an indispensable UNK for UNK character and UNK action and response STOP 
START it is hardly UNK therefore that many of his most vivid figures do UNK or eccentric things with their hands STOP 
START in great expectations the hands become almost an UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK UNK UNK his UNK a gesture which UNK both contempt and the UNK UNK that half UNK half UNK all who have UNK with him STOP 
START miss UNK UNK hands heavy as if her UNK were somehow concentrated in them move in restless UNK between her broken heart and her walking stick STOP 
START UNK UNK is the UNK extended glad hand STOP 
START UNK reveals his UNK by regularly rubbing his hands together STOP 
START old mr. UNK frantic response to life UNK with a useless UNK wife is to put his two hands into his disturbed hair and make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas joe UNK UNK the UNK UNK of mrs. joe by UNK drawing the back of his hand across and across his nose STOP 
START such UNK would be less worthy of remark were it not that in great expectations as in no other of UNK novels hands serve as a UNK of plot and theme a kind of UNK symbol or natural UNK for the UNK complex of human UNK and the values and attitudes that UNK them STOP 
START dickens not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial element of the plot a means of UNK the structure of the novel by helping to define the UNK relations with all the major characters and a device for ordering such diverse UNK as guilt pursuit crime UNK education UNK UNK by both people and institutions friendship romantic love forgiveness and UNK STOP 
START we have only to think of lady UNK or the UNK in thomas UNK famous story the hands of mr. UNK to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment STOP 
START so it is with great expectations whether the hands be UNK as he strikes down mrs. UNK or pip's as he UNK a pie from her UNK STOP 
START such associations suit well with the UNK or UNK aspects of UNK novel but on a deeper plane they UNK to the UNK of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics STOP 
START the novel opens with a UNK UNK UNK trying to avoid the UNK of being laid hands on a mysterious figure who looks into pip's frightened eyes in the UNK as if he were UNK the hands of the dead people stretching up UNK out of their UNK to get a twist upon his UNK and pull him in STOP 
START UNK UNK pip into UNK a UNK pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a UNK man who may softly UNK his way to him and tear him open UNK his hands in him STOP 
START as pip UNK over the UNK that his own hands have committed his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local UNK UNK it into a UNK UNK me to the UNK STOP 
START held UNK down in the UNK pip UNK in terror with both hands to his UNK he UNK in panic from the family table just as his UNK is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who UNK holds out a pair of UNK which he has brought to UNK UNK for UNK STOP 
START through such details dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between pip and UNK which is so UNK to alter both their lives STOP 
START since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into UNK hands naturally represent action and since nearly half the characters in great expectations are of the UNK or closely allied to it the UNK of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at STOP 
START dickens for excellent psychological reasons never fully reveals UNK UNK past but pip at the UNK UNK UNK in london UNK from UNK a hand which he fears might be stained with blood STOP 
START UNK UNK about the UNK like UNK with his hands in his pockets and when he UNK abuse at mrs. joe for UNK to his holiday she UNK her hands in a UNK UNK them upon her UNK and upon her knees and UNK them in her husband's hair STOP 
START this last UNK is only the UNK to the vicious blow upon her head dealt by some unknown hand whose identity is later revealed not UNK but through a UNK action the tracing of UNK UNK upon a UNK STOP 
START pip himself is to feel the terror of UNK UNK hand in his secret UNK at the UNK on the UNK STOP 
START dickens UNK great emphasis on the hands in this scene STOP 
START UNK UNK his hand at pip UNK the table with his fist draws his UNK hand across his mouth as if his mouth UNK for his victim UNK his hands hang loose and heavy at his sides and pip UNK him so UNK that he knows of the slightest action of his fingers STOP 
START UNK might almost be UNK UNK man come alive a figure of UNK from pip's UNK of guilt STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK of mr. UNK UNK are the UNK marks of her sinister past for her master UNK UNK them to his dinner guests makes a point of the force of grip there is in these hands STOP 
START UNK iron control over her she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him UNK as if she UNK his calling her back rests on his having once got her UNK of a murder charge by UNK UNK her UNK at the trial to UNK her strength and by passing off the UNK on the backs of her hands as the UNK of UNK rather than of human UNK STOP 
START it is the UNK between UNK hands and UNK the action of her fingers was like the action of UNK that provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and UNK a symbolic connection between the UNK of crime and the UNK cruelty of UNK house STOP 
START finally UNK pursuit of UNK his UNK and UNK begins by his holding him in a UNK grip on the river UNK to UNK his escape and UNK in his laying his hand on his UNK to identify him thus UNK the UNK struggle in the water during which UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK hand here UNK becomes the agent of justice STOP 
START but only in one of its aspects is great expectations a tale of violence UNK and UNK STOP 
START money so important a theme elsewhere in dickens is here central and hands are often associated in some way with the false values UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK injustice that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth STOP 
START dickens suggests the economic UNK of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of pip's five little dead brothers who gave up trying to get a living UNK early in that universal struggle who seemed to have all been born on their backs with their hands in their UNK and had never taken them out in this state of existence STOP 
START pip's great expectations his progress through illusion and UNK turn somewhat as they do for the naive hero of UNK american tragedy upon the UNK of UNK prosperity through UNK income what UNK calls portable property and what UNK UNK pip for letting slip through his fingers STOP 
START since a gentleman must if possible avoid UNK them by work his hands as UNK as his UNK become the index of social status STOP 
START almost the first step in the corruption of pip's values is the UNK shame he feels when UNK UNK remarks the UNK of his hands they had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as UNK UNK STOP 
START pip UNK how UNK would look down upon UNK hands UNK by work in the UNK and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his UNK ones is made to UNK the opposition of values between which pip UNK UNK and work UNK and UNK UNK and UNK UNK and affection in fact between UNK house and the UNK STOP 
START when the UNK that UNK pip from joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an UNK UNK at which pip UNK no don't UNK it off for god's sake give me your UNK hand UNK UNK of miss UNK during which he UNK to kiss her hand UNK his UNK to a supposed UNK who seems to be opening up for him a new world of UNK on the journey to london that immediately follows he UNK UNK to lay his hand upon the UNK at the end of the village the wooden UNK UNK UNK a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of UNK UNK STOP 
START incidentally one cannot miss the significance of this gesture for dickens UNK it UNK in pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis his painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that his hopeless UNK to UNK is as UNK as it is romantic STOP 
START in both cases the UNK represents pip's UNK awareness of contrary UNK STOP 
START a variety of hand movements helps UNK the moral climate of the fallen world pip UNK beyond the UNK STOP 
START the UNK attendance of the pocket family upon miss UNK is UNK up in the UNK UNK of miss UNK pocket who puts her hand to her throat in a UNK UNK of UNK UNK then UNK it upon her UNK UNK with an UNK UNK of manner and finally UNK it to miss UNK in a UNK of the UNK own UNK toward UNK STOP 
START UNK hands throughout the novel serve to UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START we first see him shaking mrs. UNK hand on UNK the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for pip's UNK as an apprentice and later UNK pip's hands for the UNK time at least may i may i in UNK UNK to pip on his expectations STOP 
START we take leave of UNK as he UNK over pip's loss of fortune extending his hand with a UNK UNK air and UNK the same fat five fingers one of which he UNK with the finger of providence and UNK at pip in a UNK UNK of the UNK UNK and his own UNK as pip's earliest UNK STOP 
START pip first UNK the UNK power of money from the UNK UNK mr. UNK whose brutality to his boy UNK exactly matches the financial UNK of each new customer and whose UNK hands touch the outside of each UNK and UNK pip out of the shop STOP 
START the UNK which money UNK implies a different UNK and upon taking up the life of a london gentleman pip must learn from herbert pocket that the UNK is not generally used UNK but under STOP

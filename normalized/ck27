START the doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to UNK alex further into these UNK STOP 
START the doctor opened the smallest of his cases an UNK straw bag and exposed the contents for UNK inspection STOP 
START inside carefully packed in straw were six eggs but the eye of a poultry UNK was required to UNK what UNK valuable UNK lay inside alex they were merely six not unusual UNK eggs STOP 
START there was little enough time to UNK them however an instant the doctor was UNK across the room with an antique UNK in his hands thoroughly UNK and big as a table top STOP 
START he placed it on UNK lap STOP 
START this is my hen UNK he informed him in an absorbed way STOP 
START it's been going since UNK when i was a junior in college STOP

START the UNK was full of most precise information date of laying length of UNK period number of UNK reaching the first week second week fifth week weight of hen size of UNK UNK and so on all UNK out in a hand that looked more chinese than english the most UNK and UNK alex had ever seen STOP 
START below these UNK was a series of UNK connected by UNK and UNK which UNK the UNK of the breed STOP 
START UNK instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the UNK UNK de UNK to hear more speeches with only time for one UNK of wine to sustain him through them all STOP 
START but after the doctor's return that night alex could see from the high window in his own room the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels apparently giving its UNK powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a UNK hen STOP 
START a UNK at UNK door UNK him at six o'clock the following morning STOP 
START it was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and alex was obliged to prepare himself in UNK STOP 
START the doctor stood about waiting for alex to dress with a show of UNK and soon they were moving as quietly as could be through the UNK UNK past the bedroom of the UNK and so into the street STOP 
START the market was not far and once there the doctor's sense of UNK left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him STOP 
START he UNK the UNK and they responded with delighted UNK he UNK with the UNK and they at once were all attention he UNK with the UNK and UNK with a pair of UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his UNK when quite abruptly something broke his UNK STOP 
START it was a fine UNK hen white with a UNK eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the UNK STOP 
START the doctor with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope drew UNK attention to those UNK which might otherwise have escaped him the fine color in UNK and UNK the length and quality of neck and saddle UNK the firm wide spread of the toes and a rare UNK in the formation of the ear UNK STOP 
START all search was ended had found his UNK STOP 
START the purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again the hen with whom some sort of communication had been set up UNK in the doctor's arms STOP 
START the UNK struck UNK as they approached the hotel entrance hopes that the UNK and UNK would still be UNK began to rise in UNK well exercised breast STOP 
START the doctor was wearing a long new england UNK hardly necessary in the june weather but a UNK which proved well adapted to the UNK of UNK STOP 
START alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who for all his care UNK a UNK UNK on his left side where the hen was UNK STOP 
START they advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the UNK and up with UNK steps towards the first landing STOP 
START it was then that they heard the UNK of one UNK and in some UNK UNK up saw the UNK coming towards them as they gained the landing STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK she greeted them UNK STOP 
START alex explained that they had been out for a UNK before breakfast while the doctor UNK around behind him attempting to hide the UNK at his left side behind UNK arm and back STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK de suite UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START alex told her that there was no hurry for their UNK trying at the same time to effect a UNK separation of the persons before and behind him STOP 
START the doctor he noticed was attempting a UNK movement towards the stairs but before the movement could be completed a distinct and UNK UNK UNK the air in the hollow of the UNK STOP 
START eyes UNK in the UNK head alex UNK loudly and the doctor with a UNK of chicken UNK floating behind him took to the stairs in UNK UNK STOP 
START comment the surprised woman looking at alex for an explanation but he UNK from her without ceremony only offered a few words about the doctor's UNK american speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work STOP 
START with that he hurried up the stairs followed by her suspicious gaze STOP 
START when alex entered his room the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case six eggs ready for the UNK UNK STOP 
START there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business STOP 
START the hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them STOP 
START one part of her audience was totally engaged the UNK UNK a UNK fine performance of some ancient classic the other part the guest of the UNK UNK as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand STOP 
START the spectacle progressed towards a UNK which was obviously still remote audience attended STOP 
START time UNK but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an UNK knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature STOP 
START startled he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and alex went to the door STOP 
START he opened it a crack and in doing so made as much UNK UNK and UNK noise as possible in order to UNK UNK from the hen who had begun to protest STOP 
START it was UNK the UNK de UNK come to clean the room and while she stood before him with ears UNK up and regard all curiosity explaining her UNK alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the UNK bird STOP 
START UNK was reluctant but alex succeeded in UNK her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again STOP 
START who was that young UNK doctor instantly asked STOP 
START that was the UNK de UNK the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out STOP 
START she looked mighty interested though STOP 
START anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room STOP 
START the doctor's mind was working at a great speed rose to put his UNK on and addressed alex in a UNK voice STOP 
START have you got our keys handy right in my pocket STOP 
START all right STOP 
START now you go outside and UNK me when it's safe STOP 
START the hall was empty and alex UNK climbed the stairs which UNK very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next floor STOP 
START a guest was locking his room passed behind him and got to UNK room UNK STOP 
START the doctor sat down rather UNK UNK the hen and UNK that the city was not the place for a UNK man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his UNK once more STOP 
START at the door alex managed to persuade the increasingly UNK UNK de UNK to return in ten minutes STOP 
START it was evident that a second transfer had to be effected and that it had to take place between the time the UNK finished the doctor's room and the time she began UNK STOP 
START they waited three minutes and then crept out on UNK UNK were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door STOP 
START a UNK of sheets being UNK and UNK being arranged indicated the UNK de UNK presence inside listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact STOP 
START the doctor shot down to the UNK and turned the UNK but to no effect the UNK was occupied STOP 
START although a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the UNK emerged from number nine STOP 
START alex UNK those expressions of relief which offered to UNK in his face and escape from his throat they were in any case for as he stood facing the UNK de UNK his ears were UNK by new sounds from the interior of the shower room STOP 
START the events of the last quarter of an hour mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the UNK life of UNK and UNK had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of UNK UNK perhaps UNK her nest but briefly enjoyed STOP 
START the doctor's UNK had not left him however for all his UNK years and the UNK were almost immediately lost in the sound of water UNK out from the UNK STOP 
START alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room STOP 
START shortly the doctor himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures STOP 
START without comment he opened the closet and from its UNK constructed a UNK around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside STOP 
START next the hen was UNK and all seemed well STOP 
START the two men sat for some time UNK the pleasure of escape from UNK and the relief such escape brings before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference house and alex to go to the main post office STOP 
START alex returned to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an UNK mood STOP 
START at the time alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most UNK after the UNK of the morning STOP 
START chickens have short memories the doctor remarked that's why they are better company than most people i know and he went on to break some important news to alex STOP 
START well he began it seems like some people in paris want to hear more from me than those UNK over at the conference house do STOP 
START they've got a big UNK from UNK at the UNK here with a wife for him too very rare birds both of them the only UNK of their species outside africa STOP 
START seems like she's willing but the male just UNK around all day like the UNK boy who took UNK may behind the barn and then didn't know what to do and the people at the UNK haven't got any UNK UNK to show for their trouble STOP

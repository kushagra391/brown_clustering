START with this evidence in mind the writer began to plan how he might more effectively UNK the married students in his functional classes STOP 
START toward the end of the UNK work he interviewed every married class member at great length STOP 
START he found as he had suspected a general UNK that perhaps over half of the present UNK designed course was not really functional for these students STOP 
START however all admitted that the UNK was not altogether lost STOP 
START in their own words it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten into their marriages and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time STOP 
START in fact they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be at the beginning some UNK study they all UNK to add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent STOP 
START all of them felt a UNK need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course STOP 
START a few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students STOP 
START as one of them expressed it it has done me a world of good to listen to the naive questions and comments of these UNK people STOP 
START i can now better see just what processes UNK certain actions from me in the past STOP 
START had i been in an UNK section i would have missed this and i believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me STOP 
START this comment and others similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status quo STOP 
START but the weight of feeling was heavily in the opposite direction STOP 
START thus the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring UNK of 1960 exclusively for persons already married that is UNK marriage STOP 
START this did not mean that married students could not UNK in other mixed sections and some of them largely because of UNK difficulties did STOP 
START but only those already married could UNK in this one section STOP 
START in addition two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted STOP 
START 1 the regular sections do not allow UNK one did STOP 
START this action was UNK on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married UNK women on our campus never become UNK STOP 
START many of them appear to drop out for one reason or another STOP 
START by UNK UNK students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it STOP 
START this has subsequently been UNK by the experience STOP 
START 2 UNK were encouraged STOP 
START in the regular sections they have always been more or less discouraged STOP 
START the philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively STOP 
START besides UNK do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly UNK students STOP 
START but in this one section we welcomed UNK STOP 
START why no particular reason other than that the writer felt it might just might encourage both UNK to be in attendance STOP 
START many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum especially in the various engineering fields with few UNK till the senior year STOP 
START incidentally it needs to be noted that because UNK were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week until at last it UNK to such proportions that this free UNK policy had to be UNK STOP 
START after that we began to get visitors to class STOP 
START this experimental class represented quite a variety of students STOP 
START it ranged from a UNK woman just married through the various academic growth stages including one UNK student to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also attended STOP 
START it ranged from those with no children through students in various stages of UNK to one UNK male with four children three of whom were UNK STOP 
START it ranged from two women members who had experienced UNK UNK to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive STOP 
START one might UNK at this point and UNK that if it is wise to create special sections for special status then why not a special section for women UNK before marriage and one for UNK men with UNK children and so on STOP 
START some of these UNK may have some merit others are somewhat ambiguous STOP 
START but few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of UNK relationships is different in marriage than in a UNK situation STOP 
START the writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in the first place STOP 
START he made it clear from the beginning that this was the UNK opportunity and that the future destiny of such groups UNK on favorable results from this one STOP 
START he did build a framework of academic UNK and one which did not UNK upon the sacred sovereignty of any other existing campus course STOP 
START this is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods nor a course in how to raise children STOP 
START we already have courses covering those problems and so on STOP 
START but within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible STOP 
START a UNK committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and UNK the direction and pace the class was taking STOP 
START the writer being UNK through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students did insist on there being included some UNK material STOP 
START but the greater part of UNK time was actually centered around the attitudes so we are married now how do we make the best of it how do we UNK our already fine marriage were used as with all sections but with one big difference STOP 
START our campus unfortunately owns no films STOP 
START since they are all either UNK or borrowed the requested dates for their use have to be far in advance STOP 
START the writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be STOP 
START for example the UNK committee might announce that the group felt a UNK under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too much of it UNK STOP 
START since the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning he had to go along with their decision after of course pointing out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an UNK one STOP 
START thus the films seen as they came in coordinated for the regular sections were often out of context STOP 
START nevertheless the writer has never experienced such UNK of discussion after film UNK STOP 
START though it did not become known to the writer for some time a nucleus group had UNK up within the class STOP 
START they began to meet in the evenings and carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class STOP 
START from a few students this group gradually increased to include over UNK of those officially UNK in the class and many UNK as well STOP 
START also although only a few of the students were UNK acquainted with each other in the beginning most reported that when the UNK ended their UNK and UNK campus UNK were with members of that class STOP 
START in fact they often UNK their social activities to include class members previously unknown STOP 
START UNK outside reading reports were handled just as in the other sections the major difference being that there was a UNK deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group STOP 
START these students although they might read various articles in popular magazines more often chose to report on articles found in the UNK STOP 
START in addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read STOP 
START whereas a high percentage of the regular students can be expected to read other UNK which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest STOP 
START since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment nor as a matter of fact in those who were continuing in single sections he can only conclude that there must have been something UNK within the specific group which caused this to occur STOP 
START in the main this course took the following UNK high roads STOP 
START 1 a great deal of time was spent on processes for UNK UNK differences STOP 
START this was not a search for a magic formula but rather an examination of basic principles UNK especially to all types of communication in marriage STOP 
START in short it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive UNK STOP 
START not until the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further to 2 specific adjustment areas such as sex UNK religion finance and so on STOP 
START from here they proceeded to 3 these same areas in relation to their own future family life stages developing these to the extent of UNK various crises which could be expected to UNK them at some time or other STOP 
START as an example of this last UNK there were some lengthy discussions centered around UNK STOP 
START mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the UNK of living with the UNK afterward but the possible death of one's own UNK was not UNK STOP 
START since the course one member has lost her husband STOP 
START this was not a particularly UNK or unexpected thing it was previously known to her that it might happen STOP 
START but just when was an unknown and of course the longer it did not happen the stronger her wish and belief that it might not STOP 
START since her UNK this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in this adjustment crisis STOP 
START quite frequently class members brought questions from their UNK at home STOP 
START these were often carefully written out with a great deal of thought behind them STOP 
START this added a personal UNK to class discussions and participation STOP 
START both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely UNK STOP 
START the writer sensed a much UNK and more frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before STOP 
START he felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that UNK as a criterion is not nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think STOP 
START this was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time and again STOP 
START on the other hand the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as a group to view sex as sex rather than always UNK it with love as most women seem to do STOP 
START in the UNK area it could be readily observed that all felt UNK to discuss things than students had previously in mixed UNK status sections STOP 
START perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent STOP 
START never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine UNK discussions about the feelings of both UNK during various stages of UNK STOP 
START there was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of UNK was represented from a UNK couple to and including every UNK STOP 
START in fact we had one birth before the end of the course and another student had to take the final UNK a week early just to be on the safe side STOP 
START there was also one spontaneous UNK during the UNK STOP

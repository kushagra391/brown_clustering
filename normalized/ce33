START sixty miles north of new york city where the UNK hills of UNK county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there is a new home development called UNK heights STOP 
START as a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with UNK ranch style UNK in the UNK range STOP 
START but UNK heights is unique in one particular STOP 
START its oil for heating is UNK monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point STOP 
START this is a pilot operation sponsored by a new UNK UNK in delaware as the tri-state UNK corporation with principal offices in new york state STOP 
START its president is UNK m. waters partner in the law firm of UNK waters UNK UNK UNK new york city STOP 
START vice-president is louis UNK and the UNK is mark UNK STOP 
START UNK is the builder of UNK heights and president of UNK UNK inc. UNK n.y. STOP 
START the idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a UNK STOP 
START not a year goes by but what several local companies in the u.s. and canada even overseas write to UNK oil heat to UNK if it's feasible and where it is being done STOP 
START its editors only knew of one example to point to a public housing development of UNK homes in new haven described by john UNK in the march 1950 issue STOP 
START this has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the UNK over the fact that the oil was not UNK STOP 
START rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family STOP 
START common UNK included mrs. UNK leaving her windows open all the time a fresh air fan or the family was visiting aunt UNK with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil STOP 
START as a result of that attitude others have been discouraged from trying central distribution STOP 
START a new low capacity UNK is the key that UNK the situation at UNK heights STOP 
START called a UNK UNK it was designed for this job by power plus industries of los angeles a key individual being don nelson STOP 
START tri-state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern principal heating states STOP 
START there's an advantage in having a firm like tri-state headed by a lawyer STOP 
START the earlier new haven development was public housing so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture STOP 
START these have to do with property rights municipal official attitudes and a host of others STOP 
START in working out the practical legal conclusions president waters was not thinking only of this pilot project for it is planned to UNK this program or system in other builder developments UNK STOP 
START it is always difficult or at least UNK to get approval of any kind of line under a public street as one example STOP 
START to overcome this the builder UNK and UNK the street himself then UNK it to the community while UNK a UNK UNK for the oil lines STOP 
START when a family buys a home the title is subject to a UNK UNK to tri-state STOP 
START for the central storage tri-state buys one UNK UNK its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece STOP 
START in other words the whole storage and UNK system does not belong to the UNK nor to the town but rather to tri-state STOP 
START how does tri-state get its revenue from this plan UNK the whole facility to a large oil company at least large enough to have a strong credit position STOP 
START this first test is being UNK for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years STOP 
START the amount paid by the oil company to tri-state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes is subject to UNK but naturally must be profitable to both parties STOP 
START on this first venture the central storage is UNK UNK in two tanks or an average of 400 UNK for each of the 50 homes STOP 
START the UNK UNK at his convenience in transport UNK so as to maintain UNK weeks reserve supply against weather UNK STOP 
START however that is not all he has to do STOP 
START he must undertake complete UNK of the UNK equipment to assure fine heating STOP 
START in the present project the heating is by UNK hot water from UNK UNK units with UNK domestic hot water UNK STOP 
START again the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best STOP 
START for this first development the UNK UNK the UNK is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local UNK UNK STOP 
START the major gets the assured UNK for the life of the UNK and the UNK apparently can do well because delivery cost is low STOP 
START initial considerations the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles as well as personalities that might be affected STOP 
START for example the officials of UNK town UNK where the project is located think highly of it because it UNK their snow clearing problem STOP 
START the central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large UNK on a short UNK swing with fewer trucks in the residential streets STOP 
START the public service commission has ruled that this is not a public utility subject to their many regulations STOP 
START several financial institutions both banks and insurance companies have been sounded out STOP 
START they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term UNK by strong oil companies STOP 
START the government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special UNK STOP 
START there must be a UNK in the UNK to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil an obvious UNK since the account is permanently UNK just like with gas or electricity STOP 
START for a few details of the system the lines are UNK UNK a product of republic steel corp. and all lines are UNK STOP 
START they are laid a minimum of UNK deep and in some areas four feet down particularly under roads to stay clear of all other UNK such as water and UNK and to minimize UNK from heavy UNK STOP 
START the UNK is mounted high on the basement wall STOP 
START its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read even into UNK UNK STOP 
START it will accommodate firing rates as low as a half UNK an hour STOP 
START UNK the builder is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters STOP 
START he believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available STOP 
START it would be pretty difficult to UNK a tri-state system in old neighborhoods and that's an UNK STOP 
START the job of getting property UNK and street UNK and the UNK for the tanks would become pretty UNK STOP 
START but in a new development where everything starts from UNK the solutions are simple STOP 
START future plans what does tri-state actually want to do now that it has the meters under UNK and certain phases of its UNK system in the patent applied for stage wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects by financing and UNK the storage UNK and meters and UNK these for 15 years with UNK UNK to a strong oil company STOP 
START it may also work in one other way by UNK its system patents and supplying the meters letting the oil company or even the builder UNK the facilities STOP 
START this whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers for the idea has so often been mentioned somewhat UNK STOP 
START but it's too early yet to go visit UNK heights STOP 
START only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the UNK visit on june UNK were building STOP 
START the big tanks were at the site but still UNK themselves STOP 
START a big mechanical UNK was running the UNK and the town building inspector was paying a friendly if curious visit STOP 
START the UNK industry is looking up led by a UNK of research and development STOP 
START a primary UNK in these fields is imagination and tri-state UNK corporation deserves a very good mark STOP 
START every year about this time national UNK your cooling system week rolls around STOP 
START it pays in the long hot run to take good care of the water works STOP 
START do it this way for the summer UNK first drain that old UNK down the storm UNK STOP 
START don't save the UNK even if it the expensive permanent type STOP 
START the word means it won't boil away easily nothing else STOP 
START the UNK UNK in the fluid are used up after one year and you don't want to risk the UNK that two UNK use could mean STOP 
START pitch it out STOP 
START if a lot of UNK shows in the drain use a good UNK UNK STOP 
START then fill the system and add a UNK UNK STOP 
START of course you'll want to use the UNK water you can in your UNK STOP 
START now check for UNK in your UNK and UNK connections around the UNK UNK UNK water pump UNK and heater UNK STOP 
START next run the engine and let it heat up so the UNK opens and then look for UNK again STOP 
START be sure the UNK and dirt are UNK out of the UNK UNK STOP 
START use the air UNK for this job STOP 
START check the temperature UNK and be sure it is working STOP 
START if you use one of the new UNK cooling system fluids such as UNK be sure to check it STOP 
START UNK says that the fluid can be used now for two years STOP 
START check its UNK effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer STOP 
START take UNK now to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat UNK when the temperature UNK this summer STOP 
START don't let your mechanics pull the UNK out of those UNK delivery trucks or installation UNK of yours STOP 
START spring and summer may be here officially but those UNK stay in STOP 
START the fact is that UNK and leaving out a UNK from any water cooled vehicle will greatly increase the fuel consumption reduce power and contribute to spark plug UNK due to an accumulation of excessive carbon UNK on the UNK STOP 
START if you run into excess plug UNK on one truck check to be sure that the UNK has a UNK STOP 
START the UNK is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the UNK STOP 
START are you paying too much for your truck insurance a good chance you are UNK on some coverage not taking UNK coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut STOP 
START have a talk with your insurance agent STOP 
START be careful that you keep adequate coverage but look for places to save money STOP 
START first go over the type of coverage you now have STOP 
START look for these features which may mean you can save UNK coverage STOP 
START avoid UNK up on the same item STOP 
START for example don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy STOP 
START does your policy have a UNK UNK means that if your UNK vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days insurance can be suspended and a UNK return of your premium made to you STOP 
START this applies to repair work of winter storage STOP 
START the figure five is important in insurance STOP 
START with many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more UNK STOP 
START this means either cars or trucks STOP 
START UNK run up to UNK of cost STOP 
START usually premium UNK can be obtained by applying UNK to your UNK plan STOP 
START for example if your UNK injury claims start payment after the first UNK a UNK premium saving is often made STOP

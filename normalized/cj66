START UNK UNK modern UNK like UNK and UNK is perceived only by its effects at more UNK social levels where it is called UNK STOP 
START UNK by the way is the term used by the critic and poet lawrence UNK who has written several articles on this subject the first of which in the nation quoted as UNK we UNK STOP 
START john l. lewis STOP 
START like the UNK of UNK like two ruined UNK UNK the entrance to one of UNK circles stand two great dead juvenile UNK the heroes of the UNK generation the great UNK charlie parker and dylan thomas STOP 
START if the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves STOP 
START both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely UNK art STOP 
START both of them were my friends STOP 
START living in san francisco i saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by UNK or fatigue STOP 
START so as the years passed i saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal UNK STOP 
START the last time i saw bird at UNK bob city he was so gone so blind to the world that he literally sat down on me before he realized i was there STOP 
START what happened man said referring to the UNK jazz concert STOP 
START evil man evil he said and that's all he said for the rest of the night STOP 
START about dawn he got up to blow STOP 
START the UNK crowd UNK into UNK and the UNK melody UNK through it STOP 
START the last time i saw dylan his UNK had not just passed the limits of UNK STOP 
START it had assumed the UNK UNK of UNK matter STOP 
START being with him was like being swept away by a UNK of falling stones STOP 
START now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end STOP 
START as artists they were very similar STOP 
START they were both very UNK STOP 
START but this UNK UNK UNK had compared with important artists of the past relatively little content STOP 
START neither of them got very far beyond a sort of UNK UNK at his own UNK STOP 
START the principal theme of UNK poetry was the UNK of birth and death the pain of UNK creation STOP 
START music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift STOP 
START both of them did communicate one central theme against the ruin of the world there is only one defense the creative act STOP 
START this of course is the theme of much art perhaps most poetry STOP 
START it is the theme of UNK who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to parker or thomas STOP 
START the difference is that UNK accepted his theme with a kind of UNK assurance STOP 
START to dylan and bird it was an UNK and terror STOP 
START i do not believe that this is due to anything especially UNK about their relationship to their own UNK STOP 
START i believe rather that it is due to the UNK world in which that UNK seemed to be the sole value STOP 
START UNK column of UNK verse UNK quietly enough in the UNK air of UNK rome STOP 
START art may have been for him the most UNK orderly and noble activity of man STOP 
START but the other activities of his life UNK of these values STOP 
START they did not actively UNK them STOP 
START dylan UNK verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning jews STOP 
START he was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air UNK and gas UNK STOP 
START as the world began to take on the UNK of an immense air UNK or gas UNK i believe his art became meaningless to him STOP 
START i think all this could apply to parker just as well although because of the nature of music it is not UNK at least not UNK STOP 
START thomas and parker have more in common than theme attitude life pattern STOP 
START in the practice of their art there is an obvious technical resemblance STOP 
START contrary to popular belief they were not great technical UNK STOP 
START their effects are only UNK startling STOP 
START thomas is a UNK from the technical UNK and UNK of writers like pierre UNK or UNK STOP 
START similarly the UNK of UNK and of parker particularly have been UNK UNK by people UNK with music especially by that UNK the intellectual UNK the jazz UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK consist in the introduction of a few UNK used in classical music for centuries STOP 
START and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz no matter how progressive and UNK than there is between two movements of many conventional UNK STOP 
START what parker and his UNK UNK davis monk UNK UNK is an UNK etc. did was to absorb the musical UNK of the older jazz into the basic structure of which it then became an integral part and with which it then developed STOP 
START this is true of the UNK line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody UNK UNK johnny hodges STOP 
START it is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least is continuously UNK so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long UNK of the phrase or UNK STOP 
START this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to UNK music STOP 
START it is the difference between UNK and UNK STOP 
START it is not a UNK analogy to say that this is what thomas did to poetry STOP 
START the special UNK effects of a UNK or an UNK UNK actually UNK become the main concern STOP 
START the metaphysical UNK which UNK the reactionary generation still dominant in UNK american colleges were UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK are ends in themselves STOP 
START the immediate theme if it exists is UNK and his main theme the terror of birth is simply UNK STOP 
START this is one difference between bird and dylan which should be pointed out STOP 
START again contrary to popular belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about parker either UNK or emotionally STOP 
START his UNK melody is a sort of naive UNK of all experience STOP 
START emotionally it does not UNK UNK or wagner UNK UNK STOP 
START this is true also of a painter like jackson UNK STOP 
START he may have been eccentric in his behavior but his paintings are as UNK as UNK UNK STOP 
START partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication STOP 
START the UNK UNK of the general environment UNK into even the most UNK poetry STOP 
START it is much more a personal difference STOP 
START thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and UNK of the world STOP 
START parker and UNK wanted to substitute a work of art for the world STOP 
START technique pure and simple UNK is not of major importance but it is interesting that parker following lester young was one of the leaders of the so-called UNK revolution STOP 
START in modern jazz the UNK is treated as a UNK and played with conventional UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK verse was extremely conventional as was incidentally the verse of that other tragic UNK hart UNK STOP 
START i want to make clear what i consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant UNK arts STOP 
START UNK is UNK in the UNK of structure STOP 
START a poem by dylan thomas a UNK UNK by charles parker a painting by jackson UNK these are pure UNK as ends in themselves STOP 
START UNK has come to determine structure STOP 
START UNK UNK should be distinguished from its exact opposite the UNK UNK invention of the UNK UNK or present UNK of poetic professors STOP 
START just as hart UNK had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers like allen UNK for instance to whom UNK was the last word in modern poetry and the UNK of an UNK let alone a paul UNK were nonsense so dylan UNK influence has been slight indeed STOP 
START in fact his only UNK the only person to UNK his style was w. s. graham who seems to have UNK him without much understanding and who has since moved on to other methods STOP 
START UNK principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude that of the now UNK british romantic school of the new UNK henry UNK j. f. UNK and others all of whom were quite conventional poets STOP 
START parker certainly had much more of an influence STOP 
START at one time it was the ambition of every UNK player in every high school band in america to blow like bird STOP 
START even before his death this influence had begun to UNK STOP 
START in fact the whole generation of the founding fathers of UNK UNK monk davis UNK and the rest are just now at a considerable discount STOP 
START the main line of development today goes back to lester young and UNK them STOP 
START the point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are UNK UNK STOP 
START there is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from UNK to UNK or for that matter from UNK through henry james to UNK stein STOP 
START the UNK generation before world war 1 and on a lower level the UNK of the period between the wars both assumed an accepted universe of UNK in which to quote UNK UNK it was possible to make definite advances exactly as in the sciences STOP 
START i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today STOP 
START continuity UNK but like the UNK music developed from lester young it is a continuity sustained by popular demand STOP 
START in the plastic arts a very similar situation exists STOP 
START UNK like hans UNK and max UNK might talk of creation by hazard of UNK pictures by walking on them with painted UNK or by UNK bits of paper up in the air STOP 
START but it is obvious that they were UNK STOP 
START nothing looks anything like an UNK or an UNK but another UNK or UNK STOP 
START nothing looks less like their work than the UNK of random occasion STOP 
START many of the UNK war 2 abstract UNK UNK of the discipline of UNK and hazard look alike and do look like UNK STOP 
START the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist but it is a very UNK appeal STOP 
START once again what has happened is an UNK UNK of the UNK the UNK of painting STOP 
START it is curious that at its best the work of this school of painting mark UNK jackson UNK UNK still robert UNK UNK UNK and the rest UNK nothing so much as the passage painting of quite UNK painters the UNK UNK in the background of a henry UNK itself a formula derived from UNK UNK of light and black which UNK UNK in the fashionable UNK of UNK and UNK STOP 
START often work of this sort is presented as UNK the pure UNK of the brush stroke seeking only absolute UNK values STOP 
START you have only to compare such painting with the work of say UNK to realize that someone is using words and UNK UNK STOP 
START at its best the abstract UNK achieve a simple UNK UNK surface STOP 
START its poverty shows up immediately when compared with UNK where the UNK rises to painting of extraordinary UNK and power STOP 
START a UNK painting however UNK is a universe of tensions in vast depths STOP 
START a UNK is an object of art UNK disguised only by its great size STOP 
START in fact once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive UNK STOP 
START now there is nothing wrong with complicated UNK STOP 
START there is just more to UNK STOP 
START the great UNK brush painters painted UNK too at least portable ones UNK STOP 
START a process of UNK which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long STOP 
START so in the last couple of years abstract UNK has tended toward romantic suggestion indications of landscape or living figures STOP

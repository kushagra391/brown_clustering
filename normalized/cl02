START i was giving the parked cars the UNK STOP 
START the UNK with the license number UNK UNK was in stall number five STOP 
START okay i said to the attendant i'll let you know if i close the deal on the office in this building STOP 
START i walked with him back to the entrance STOP 
START he gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it STOP 
START i was back in ten minutes STOP 
START forgot to get something out of the car i told him showing him my ticket STOP 
START he started to say something as i walked in and then suddenly grinned and said oh yes STOP 
START you're the one i was talking to about a monthly rental STOP 
START that's right i told him STOP 
START he consulted the parking ticket then looked at a UNK and said you're in the third row back toward the rear STOP 
START can you find it all right sure i told him STOP 
START i went back to the agency car and got out an electric UNK one of the newest devices for electronic UNK STOP 
START i always keep a set in the car STOP 
START i put in new UNK so as to be certain i'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking UNK and stood looking at them thoughtfully STOP 
START i waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer then slipped around the back of the car with license number UNK UNK attached the electronic UNK to the rear UNK and walked out STOP 
START the attendant waved me on STOP 
START one of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying to make himself UNK keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting STOP 
START for the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays then in people passing by STOP 
START after a while however a UNK mind gets fed up and that UNK all of the UNK physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment STOP 
START you want to sit down STOP 
START your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary STOP 
START you're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt that the city UNK are hard STOP 
START i waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building STOP 
START he came out alone STOP 
START i wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car STOP 
START the attendant recognized me once more and said what did you do about that office i haven't made up my mind yet i said STOP 
START it's a UNK STOP 
START i have a couple of them i'm UNK on here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking STOP 
START that curb parking is UNK and UNK particularly when it UNK he said STOP 
START i kept trying to get him to take my money STOP 
START okay i told him STOP 
START i'm in a rush right now STOP 
START i know where the car is STOP 
START want me to drive it out i'll have one of the boys get it he said STOP 
START it's one of the rules on UNK STOP 
START UNK drive out their own cars STOP 
START make it as UNK as you can will you asked STOP 
START oh that's all right he said STOP 
START you're going to be a regular STOP 
START you'll get in the office building here STOP 
START you don't want to UNK a place way out in the sticks STOP 
START you get business where the business is not where it isn't STOP 
START i grinned at him handed him a couple of dollars and said by the time you get the parking charge figured up there should be a UNK in it for you STOP 
START i hurried over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left STOP 
START i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn STOP 
START by the time i'd made it he was gone STOP 
START traffic was pretty heavy STOP 
START i turned on the electric UNK and the signal came in loud and clear STOP 
START i made time and picked him up within ten blocks STOP 
START i stayed half a block behind him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START after fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left STOP 
START i couldn't see him but the electric UNK device gave steady UNK when it was straight ahead short half UNK when the car i was following was to the left and long UNK UNK when it turned to the right STOP 
START if it ever got behind me the UNK turned to a buzz STOP 
START i turned left too soon and got a signal showing that i was still behind him but he was to the right STOP 
START after a while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me STOP 
START that meant he'd parked UNK STOP 
START i made a big circle until i located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house STOP 
START i found a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited STOP 
START my UNK was in the apartment house for two hours STOP 
START then he came out and started driving toward the beach STOP 
START by this time it was dark STOP 
START i could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic STOP 
START my lights would have been a UNK if i'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner STOP 
START moreover i'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic UNK device STOP 
START his signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz STOP 
START i UNK the block and found he was in the parking lot of a UNK restaurant STOP 
START i sat where i could watch the UNK and realized i was hungry STOP 
START i sat there with the faint odor of UNK UNK UNK my UNK and occasionally UNK the UNK of coffee STOP 
START my man came out an hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went to the swim and UNK motel STOP 
START it was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front STOP 
START i remembered it was the UNK tom place STOP 
START i waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register STOP 
START the card the man i was UNK had filled out was still on the counter STOP 
START i noticed that he was in unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of UNK l. palmer and wife giving a san francisco address STOP 
START he had written out the license number of his car but had UNK the last two figures an old dodge which is still good STOP 
START UNK times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the UNK writes out STOP 
START if he does it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the UNK of the numbers and if he should notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake STOP 
START i used the UNK of robert c. UNK gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap but a couple of phony numbers in between STOP 
START i could have written anything STOP 
START the manager of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care STOP 
START she was UNK with the law in regard to UNK but she certainly wasn't UNK license numbers or UNK the UNK STOP 
START you mean you're all alone mr. UNK that's right STOP 
START your wife isn't going to join you later i don't think so STOP 
START if you expect her to show up she said you'd better put and wife on there STOP 
START it's a UNK you know STOP 
START any difference in the rate asked STOP 
START not to you she said smiling STOP 
START it's ten dollars either way STOP 
START there are ice UNK in a UNK at the far end and in another by the office STOP 
START there are three UNK UNK machines and if you should be joined by anybody try to keep things quiet if you will STOP 
START we like to run a nice quiet place STOP 
START thank you i told her STOP 
START i took another UNK glance at the other registration card then took the key to unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car STOP 
START the construction was reasonably solid like the UNK construction of so many of the motel units that have UNK all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment STOP 
START i put a small electric UNK against the wall on the side i wanted to case STOP 
START with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard him UNK a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound of water running STOP 
START whoever his companion was going to be she was going to join him later STOP 
START she knew where to come STOP 
START he didn't have to telephone STOP 
START i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been UNK STOP 
START it's one thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply UNK a meal but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's UNK down for the night hunger can be a UNK UNK STOP 
START i had noticed a UNK down the road a quarter of a mile STOP 
START the UNK on the UNK device i had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals STOP 
START the powerful UNK i could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation and i was UNK UNK i was so hungry STOP 
START i got in the car drove down to the UNK and ordered a couple of UNK with everything included a cup of coffee and the UNK service possible STOP 
START the place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was UNK in the UNK pair of UNK i had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was and there was lots of it wanted to be UNK STOP 
START you really in a hurry handsome asked STOP 
START i'm in a hurry beautiful STOP 
START it's early in the evening to be in a hurry STOP 
START there's lots of time left STOP 
START there may not be any women left i said STOP 
START she gave a little UNK and said i don't get off work until eleven o'clock STOP 
START that's when my evening UNK STOP 
START i'll be here at UNK i said STOP 
START oh you she announced STOP 
START that's what they all say STOP 
START what's that thing going UNK in your car said UNK it that's the automatic signal that shows when the UNK key is on STOP 
START i didn't turn it off STOP 
START i reached over and switched off the electronic UNK device STOP 
START she went in to get the UNK and i switched on the device again and kept the signal from UNK car coming in steady and clear until i saw her starting back with the UNK STOP 
START then i shut off the device again STOP 
START she wanted to hang around while i was eating STOP 
START don't you think it's UNK to have dinner before you go to pick her up no i said STOP 
START it's a UNK to her STOP 
START you see she's on a diet STOP 
START UNK eat just a UNK and cottage UNK UNK and i'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place STOP 
START UNK can be terrible the girl said STOP 
START how much UNK is she not a bit i said but she's keeping her figure in hand STOP 
START she looked at me UNK STOP 
START good figures should be kept in hand she said and walked away with an exaggerated UNK STOP 
START i turned on the device again half fearful that i might find silence but the UNK came in loud and clear STOP 
START when i switched on the lights for her to come and get the check i had the exact change plus a dollar tip STOP

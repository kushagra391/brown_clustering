START copernicus did not question it UNK could not STOP 
START given the UNK context within which ancient thought UNK how could anyone have questioned this principle reasons for this are partly UNK partly philosophical and UNK by other aesthetic and cultural factors STOP 
START first the UNK reasons STOP 
START the obvious natural fact to ancient UNK was the UNK rotation of the UNK STOP 
START not only did UNK like UNK UNK and UNK UNK circles around the pole but stars which were not UNK rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night STOP 
START nor did a UNK stars vary in brightness during the course of their UNK flights STOP 
START the conclusion the distances of the UNK did not vary and their paths were circular STOP 
START moreover the UNK path over earth described a UNK of a great circle was clear from the UNK of the shadow traced by a UNK before and after noon STOP 
START as early as the UNK century b.c. the earth was seen to be UNK STOP 
START ships disappear UNK over the horizon shore their UNK appeared first STOP 
START earth being at the center of the universe would have the same shape as the latter e.g. did aristotle argue although this may not be an UNK reason in favor of UNK STOP 
START the UNK shapes of sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of UNK things STOP 
START in light of all this one would require special reasons for saying that the paths of the UNK bodies were other than circular STOP 
START why for example should the UNK have supposed the UNK rotation of the UNK to be UNK UNK angular were no reasons for such UNK then STOP 
START this UNK with the considerations above made the circular motions of UNK bodies appear an almost directly observed fact STOP 
START additional philosophical considerations advanced notably by aristotle supported further the UNK principle STOP 
START by UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK existence and UNK this with the UNK physics of UNK aristotle came to speak of the stars as perfect bodies which moved in only a perfect way UNK in a perfect circle STOP 
START now what is perfect motion must apparently be motion without UNK STOP 
START because motion which begins and ends at UNK places would e.g. for aristotle be incomplete STOP 
START circular motion however since it is eternal and perfectly continuous UNK UNK STOP 
START it is never motion towards something STOP 
START only UNK UNK things move towards what they lack STOP 
START perfect complete entities if they move at all do not move towards what they lack STOP 
START they move only in accordance with what is in their UNK STOP 
START thus circular motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely perfect UNK existence STOP 
START to return now to the UNK physics a mixture of UNK UNK water will when standing in a jar separate out with earth at the bottom water on top and the air on top of that STOP 
START a candle UNK in the air UNK its flame and smoke UNK STOP 
START this gives a clue to the UNK order of elements STOP 
START thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe STOP 
START it is covered partly with water air is UNK of that STOP 
START pure fire the stars is in the UNK STOP 
START when combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms of this universe are best appreciated when least UNK in a material UNK it becomes clear that while earth will be UNK on a scale of UNK ratios UNK bodies will be of a subtle UNK UNK existence in whose UNK pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain UNK STOP 
START the stars constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth STOP 
START this is clear when one UNK the types of motion appropriate to both regions STOP 
START a UNK shot up from earth returns UNK to its natural place of rest STOP 
START but the natural condition for the UNK bodies is neither rest nor UNK motion STOP 
START being less UNK by material UNK they UNK more of what is divine STOP 
START their motion will be eternal and perfect STOP 
START let us UNK the UNK contrasts between ptolemaic and UNK astronomy STOP 
START UNK there never was a ptolemaic system of astronomy STOP 
START UNK achievement was to have invented systematic astronomy STOP 
START the UNK and the UNK outline UNK conception of his own task as the provision of UNK tables independent UNK devices for the UNK of future planetary UNK STOP 
START indeed in the UNK edition of UNK presentation of the UNK there is a chart setting out under six distinct UNK otherwise UNK UNK for describing the planetary motions STOP 
START no attempt is made by UNK to UNK into a single scheme UNK these independent UNK STOP 
START they all have this in common the earth is situated near the center of the UNK STOP 
START but that one should UNK all these UNK run a pin through the common point and then scale each planetary UNK larger and smaller to keep the UNK from UNK this is contrary to any intention UNK ever UNK STOP 
START he might even suppose the planets to move at UNK STOP 
START UNK problem is to UNK where against the UNK bowl of night some particular light will be found at future times STOP 
START his problem concerns UNK UNK and angular UNK STOP 
START the distances of these points of light is a problem he cannot master beyond crude UNK as to the UNK of the planetary UNK viewed UNK from earth STOP 
START but none of this has prevented scientists UNK and even historians of science from speaking of the ptolemaic system in contrast to the UNK STOP 
START this is a mistake STOP 
START it is UNK by UNK the UNK UNK in the UNK with the UNK astronomy STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK that he could ever explain planetary motion STOP 
START this is what UNK the UNK character of his astronomy STOP 
START so when UNK like that of baker set out drawings of the ptolemaic system complete with earth in the center and the seven UNK bodies UNK arranged on their several UNK we have nothing but a UNK UNK idea of what never existed historically STOP 
START it is the chief merit in UNK work that all his planetary UNK are UNK STOP 
START he cannot e.g. UNK the UNK arc traveled by mars without also making UNK about the earth's own motion STOP 
START he cannot describe UNK without entertaining some form of a UNK problem STOP 
START in ptolemaic terms however UNK and UNK motion were phenomena UNK to be explained directly as possible UNK of UNK combinations STOP 
START in a systematic astronomy like that of copernicus UNK become part of the UNK structure of the system are no longer a UNK aspect of UNK variable local planetary motions STOP 
START another contrast stressed when discussing ptolemaic vs. UNK astronomy turns on the idea of simplicity STOP 
START it is often stated that UNK astronomy is simpler than ptolemaic STOP 
START some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former STOP 
START thus UNK remarks a large number of UNK UNK was needed to explain the observations but otherwise the ptolemaic system served well and with UNK precision STOP 
START copernicus by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe was able to reduce the number of UNK from UNK to seventeen STOP 
START historical records indicate that copernicus was unaware of the fundamental aspects of his so-called revolution unaware perhaps of its historical importance he rested content with having produced a simpler scheme for UNK STOP 
START as an illustration of the principle of simplicity the UNK discovery has a peculiar appeal because it allows simplicity to be UNK involves a reduction in the number of UNK from UNK to seventeen STOP 
START without careful UNK this can be UNK STOP 
START if in any one calculation UNK had had to UNK UNK UNK all at once while copernicus never required more than one third this number then in the sense obvious to UNK ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler than UNK STOP 
START but no single planetary problem ever required of UNK more than six UNK at one time STOP 
START this of course results from the UNK UNK character of ptolemaic theory STOP 
START UNK within the UNK framework always raised questions about planetary UNK STOP 
START these could be met only by considering the UNK elements of several planets at one time STOP 
START this is more ambitious than UNK is ever required to be when he faces his isolated problems STOP 
START thus in no ordinary sense of simplicity is the ptolemaic theory simpler than the UNK STOP 
START the latter required UNK several elements simultaneously STOP 
START this was not simpler but much more difficult than exercises within UNK astronomy STOP 
START UNK anyone who UNK that UNK theory of UNK is simpler than UNK must say rather more to explain how it is that the latter is UNK by UNK while the former can be managed with difficulty only by accomplished experts STOP 
START in a sense UNK theory is simpler than UNK and there is a corresponding sense in which UNK theory is simpler than UNK STOP 
START but simplicity here refers to systematic simplicity STOP 
START the number of primitive ideas in UNK theories is reduced to a minimum STOP 
START the UNK required to make the theoretical machinery operate are set out UNK and UNK so that all UNK operations within the theory can be traced UNK back to these UNK rules and primitive notions STOP 
START this UNK UNK formulation of UNK but not UNK astronomy STOP 
START there are in the UNK no rules for determining in advance whether a new UNK will be required for dealing with UNK in UNK solar or planetary behavior STOP 
START the strongest appeal of the UNK formulation consisted in just this UNK the justification for dealing with special problems in particular ways is completely set out in the basic rules of the theory STOP 
START the UNK UNK are never ad UNK never introduced UNK post UNK just to sweep up within the theory some UNK UNK STOP 
START copernicus to an extent UNK by UNK UNK to UNK vision STOP 
START de UNK is not just a collection of facts and techniques STOP 
START it is an organized system of these things STOP 
START UNK UNK problems requires for copernicus not a random search of UNK tables but a regular employment of the rules UNK the entire discipline STOP 
START hence noting the simplicity achieved in UNK formulation does not provide another reason for the acceptance of de UNK another reason beyond its systematic superiority STOP 
START it provides exactly the same reason STOP 
START UNK UNK is often UNK as the birthday of the scientific revolution STOP 
START it is really the funeral day of UNK science STOP 
START granted the UNK philosophical and cultural UNK initiated by the de UNK were felt with increasing violence during the 300 years to follow STOP 
START but considered within technical astronomy a different pattern can be traced STOP 
START in what does the UNK of UNK consist in the UNK draws his fire per UNK STOP 
START the formal displacement of the UNK principle far from being UNK primary concern was introduced only to resolve what seemed to him UNK in orthodox astronomy namely the UNK UNK of UNK UNK one center from which the UNK distances were calculated another around which planetary UNK were computed and still a third center the earth from which the observations originated STOP 
START this arrangement was for copernicus literally monstrous with the UNK it is as though an artist were to gather the hands feet head and other members for his images from UNK models each part UNK drawn but not related to a single body since they in no way match each other the result would be a UNK rather than a man STOP 
START copernicus required a UNK integrated physically intelligible astronomy STOP 
START his objective was essentially to repair those aspects of orthodox astronomy responsible for its UNK in achieving these ends STOP 
START that such UNK existed within UNK theory was not discovered de UNK by copernicus STOP 
START the critical UNK UNK of UNK of UNK and UNK of UNK provided the context a late medieval context for UNK UNK own work STOP 
START the latter looked backward upon inherited UNK STOP 
START without UNK too much copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy UNK and UNK acceptable STOP 
START he did not think himself to be firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution STOP

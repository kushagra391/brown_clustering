START it was a neat UNK for murder STOP 
START the UNK unlocked a white door UNK UNK STOP 
START the room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window STOP 
START a few UNK UNK down through that theatrical red glow UNK as falling feathers STOP

START alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the UNK table STOP 
START it was just quarter of nine STOP 
START as he ranged his UNK on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the UNK cover STOP 
START not gray like the dust that UNK in an UNK room but white STOP 
START women didn't use white face powder nowadays he recalled STOP 
START they used pink UNK or cream powder STOP 
START alec glanced into the bathroom STOP 
START blood in the UNK where the murderer appears to have washed his hands STOP 
START it seemed clean now but alec decided against a bath STOP 
START he crawled into bed and switched off the light STOP 
START in the darkness he could see the UNK reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window STOP

START in less than five minutes alec was asleep STOP 
START he never knew just what woke him STOP 
START yet suddenly he was UNK STOP 
START there was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the UNK UNK of the red light on the wall STOP

START somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes midnight STOP

START alec heard a faint sound STOP 
START his heart seemed to UNK and knock against the wall of his chest STOP 
START for the sound was inside the room STOP 
START he let his UNK UNK and UNK heavily UNK sleep STOP 
START the sound was coming nearer STOP 
START a monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and UNK STOP 
START when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared STOP 
START when the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there STOP 
START it stretched to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling STOP 
START that meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light in this case the window STOP 
START UNK alec UNK his muscles ready to jump STOP 
START the UNK UNK him with a UNK STOP 
START the shadow vanished STOP

START but he was surprised to meet it here STOP 
START UNK UNK had no connection with the UNK STOP 
START a professional UNK would not have killed her with a weapon of such small UNK as a STOP 
START nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much UNK to take his victim for a UNK ride on a lonely country road STOP

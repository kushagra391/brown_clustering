START andy did not see the newspapers the next day STOP 
START someone on his staff he suspected it was ed UNK UNK them and for this andy was grateful STOP 
START he finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping UNK a UNK he rarely used and didn't UNK until early afternoon STOP 
START memory UNK him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling UNK his stomach STOP 
START outside his window UNK a beautiful summer day STOP 
START presumably the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had UNK him STOP 
START but where was still a very big world despite all the modern UNK to the contrary STOP 
START UNK was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door STOP 
START he was UNK perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten STOP 
START he snapped to UNK at UNK entrance STOP 
START sorry mr. UNK STOP 
START nothing new STOP 
START lot of people waiting to see you though STOP 
START reporters our own people STOP 
START questions about the show tonight STOP 
START UNK picked up the telephone STOP 
START shall i let them know you're awake i suppose STOP 
START UNK UNK do you know considered STOP 
START some better STOP 
START she's got plenty of UNK mr. UNK STOP 
START you want me to call her she expecting me to shook his head so andy told him not to bother STOP 
START the only reason for UNK UNK was to comfort or to be UNK STOP 
START he could not manage the former or expect the latter had nothing to give to each other STOP 
START the UNK might look peculiar to UNK but andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances STOP 
START he had little time to himself anyway STOP 
START as the afternoon UNK toward evening the suite saw a steady UNK of UNK UNK pass in and out each with his own special problem STOP 
START UNK arrived with the writers STOP 
START they had spent the morning UNK the act eliminating all the gay songs UNK and dancing with a view of the best public relations STOP 
START what remained lacked the original UNK but it was at least UNK as UNK the tragic circumstances STOP 
START raymond fox reported that the orchestra had hastily UNK UNK song in case it was needed STOP 
START charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first to UNK with andy on the UNK of UNK the UNK UNK engagement they decided it was wise and later to announce that a prominent UNK also an agency client had agreed to fill the UNK open date STOP 
START and once bake slipped in pale and drawn last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it STOP 
START he asked if there was anything he could do STOP 
START andy invented a job to keep him busy sending him ahead to el UNK to UNK last minute arrangements STOP 
START but from UNK UNK they heard nothing STOP 
START at last it was time to UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK about spotted reporters in the lobby so andy was UNK away quietly through the UNK service entrance in a strange car which UNK had UNK somewhere STOP 
START they succeeded in UNK the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the UNK STOP 
START el UNK was surrounded by a UNK STOP 
START they UNK the parking lot making progress by automobile difficult STOP 
START long before he reached the protection of the stage door andy was recognized STOP 
START word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a UNK STOP 
START they UNK around him fingers pointing eyes UNK STOP 
START it was not a hostile gathering but andy sensed the difference from last night's UNK STOP 
START they had come not to UNK but to observe STOP 
START it's worse inside UNK informed andy STOP 
START UNK UNK in every table he could find STOP 
START under the heading of it's an ill wind et UNK STOP 
START UNK was UNK by contrast STOP 
START UNK UNK kept their distance UNK by the tragedy STOP 
START but in his dressing room was a large UNK and a card that read we're with you all the way STOP 
START it was signed by everyone in the UNK STOP 
START andy couldn't help but be touched STOP 
START he instructed UNK winter to UNK a note of thanks to be posted on the call board STOP 
START bake was waiting to report that lou UNK had been UNK up to the point where he could function UNK STOP 
START andy gathered that this had been no small UNK STOP 
START bake himself looked better kind of job was better than brooding STOP 
START andy told him bake i wish you'd talk to UNK see if some kind of p. a. system can be UNK up outside STOP 
START it's just barely possible with this crowd that the UNK wasn't able to get a table STOP 
START i wouldn't want him to miss the message STOP 
START i'll try STOP 
START UNK isn't going to like it much though giving away what he should be selling STOP 
START UNK wasn't the only one who didn't care for UNK scheme STOP 
START a short time later lieutenant UNK UNK into the dressing room STOP 
START i got a bone to pick with you mr. UNK STOP 
START it's those damn UNK STOP 
START andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying STOP 
START what about them they're going to UNK me up good STOP 
START my men have been here all afternoon setting up for this thing STOP 
START UNK explained that with the UNK cooperation the police had occupied el UNK like a UNK STOP 
START motion picture UNK had been installed to film the audience the UNK list was being checked out name by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot UNK automobiles for a possible lead STOP 
START however it was virtually impossible to screen the UNK outside even if UNK had manpower available for the purpose STOP 
START i want you to have the speakers taken out STOP 
START andy sighed STOP 
START seems like we're never going to see eye to eye lieutenant STOP 
START didn't they tell you what i wanted the p. a. system for sure i know STOP 
START but it's such a long shot no longer than yours STOP 
START what do you expect to get tonight anyway think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces have a sign on his car that says here comes the UNK UNK UNK the script in his fist STOP 
START i can't stop you from doing what you think is right STOP 
START but don't try to stop me either STOP 
START someday UNK said you're going to ask us for help STOP 
START i can hardly wait STOP 
START what you don't understand is that i'm asking for it now STOP 
START but UNK UNK still full of ill will STOP 
START he had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination had to UNK to routine tested procedures STOP 
START to act otherwise would be to admit his UNK STOP 
START but admit or not UNK was helpless STOP 
START the crime showed too much planning the UNK appeared too UNK to be caught by a UNK STOP 
START UNK performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock STOP 
START he UNK for a UNK longer hoping to hear something from UNK about the UNK money STOP 
START bake and UNK winter on separate UNK could not reach him at any conceivable location in los angeles nor could they secure any UNK information regarding his efforts STOP 
START bake cursed STOP 
START the UNK UNK probably halfway to UNK with our money by now STOP 
START when no one smiled he felt UNK to add just UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK in to UNK andy UNK sending up smoke signals STOP 
START you about ready what's he UNK about asked STOP 
START they're drinking aren't they no STOP 
START we got a bunch of UNK out there tonight STOP 
START i guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything STOP 
START UNK added in a lower voice but andy UNK they act more like a jury than an audience STOP 
START andy said well i guess we can't wait any longer STOP 
START UNK you stick by the stage door STOP 
START if rock shows up during the number or you hear anything give me the signal STOP 
START UNK winter said i'll stay on the phone mr. UNK STOP 
START there's a couple of UNK i can work on STOP 
START you're a UNK but leave one line open STOP 
START he may try to phone us STOP 
START andy passed into the corridor their good UNK him STOP 
START it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different as if he really needed it STOP 
START they were right STOP 
START the act cut to UNK and hastily UNK together during the afternoon had not been UNK sufficiently by anyone STOP 
START the result had nothing of the polish pace or UNK of the previous night STOP 
START here's where luck would normally step in STOP 
START but this was no ordinary show and andy knew it STOP 
START whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it STOP 
START the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge STOP 
START twenty-four hours had changed him from a UNK to a UNK STOP 
START within this framework what followed was strained even UNK STOP 
START eliminating the UNK and the UNK numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal UNK STOP 
START the effect was as UNK as a UNK the applause UNK and UNK STOP 
START yet andy UNK ahead UNK the UNK words as if they possessed real meaning and gradually his listeners UNK to him STOP 
START their UNK grew more UNK evening was still not beyond UNK not as a show but for him as a person STOP 
START the worst was yet to come STOP 
START as andy reached the UNK of his act a UNK UNK UNK drew his attention to the wings STOP 
START UNK UNK a UNK UNK UNK was standing there UNK by two men in the uniforms of UNK transport guards STOP 
START UNK was UNK and pointing at the large suitcase he held STOP 
START andy felt his heart UNK heavily with relief STOP 
START he waved at fox to cut off the UNK introduction STOP 
START the music died away UNK STOP 
START he drew a deep breath STOP 
START ladies and gentlemen in place of my regular closing number tonight i'd like to sing something of a different nature for you STOP 
START ray if you please the UNK song STOP 
START he sensed rather than heard the UNK that swept across the audience STOP 
START nor could he blame them STOP 
START this particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste UNK UNK beyond the UNK of UNK STOP 
START having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the UNK for support STOP 
START UNK and UNK STOP 
START his voice shook STOP 
START for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics UNK through and had to cover up by UNK the rest STOP 
START he wondered if the audience would let him finish STOP 
START they did UNK they were still UNK STOP 
START but when he was finally through their UNK was made apparent STOP 
START someone UNK UNK then quickly stopped STOP 
START otherwise the silence was complete STOP 
START as the lights came up andy could see that a number of UNK were already on their way toward the UNK STOP 
START he stumbled UNK STOP 
START my god he muttered STOP 
START my god STOP 
START UNK was there to support him STOP 
START it's okay mr. UNK STOP 
START the UNK here all of it STOP 
START at this moment all he could think of was what he'd been forced to UNK STOP 
START did you hear them you know what they think of me bunch of damn UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START who needs them UNK his arm STOP 
START sure andy it'll be all right STOP 
START nothing broken that can't be UNK STOP 
START the words were hollow STOP 
START UNK knew better than any of them that a public image was as UNK as UNK UNK STOP 
START all the king's horses and all the king's men UNK UNK in STOP 
START i got it andy STOP 
START god knows how but i got it STOP 
START you'll never believe the places i've been today STOP 
START i practically had to sign your life away you'll probably fire me for some of the deals i had to go for but andy nodded UNK STOP 
START it doesn't matter rock STOP 
START we've done our part STOP 
START he UNK that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room STOP 
START the usual UNK crowd was UNK absent place had the air of a UNK STOP 
START andy had no desire to UNK himself but UNK reported that the UNK outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to UNK them STOP

START the UNK anniversary of the king james bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the new testament the first part of the new english bible undertaken as a new translation of the scriptures into contemporary english STOP 
START since it was issued in the spring of UNK the king james version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all UNK of the bible STOP 
START however biblical scholars frequently UNK to its numerous UNK as old UNK were UNK and scholarship advanced STOP 
START this resulted in UNK of the king james bible in UNK as the english revised version and in UNK as the american standard version STOP 
START then in UNK america's international council of religious education authorized a new UNK in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient UNK and languages STOP 
START undertaken by 32 american scholars under the UNK of rev. dr. UNK a. UNK former dean of yale university UNK school their studies resulted in the publishing of the revised standard version UNK STOP 
START not rival the new english bible the old testament and UNK will be published at a future date has not been planned to rival or replace the king james version but as its cover states it is offered simply as the bible to all those who will use it in reading teaching or worship STOP 
START time of course will UNK whether the new version will have achieved its purpose STOP 
START bible reading even more so than good classical music grows in depth and meaning upon repetition STOP 
START if this new bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years it will not survive the ages as has the king james version STOP 
START however an initial UNK and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other UNK seems to speak well of the efforts of the british biblical scholars STOP 
START one is impressed with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english and there is no doubt that the meaning of the bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently UNK words and phrases of the king james STOP 
START for example in the third chapter of UNK UNK UNK describing the UNK of jesus the UNK version reads then UNK jesus from UNK to UNK unto john to be baptized of him STOP 
START but john UNK him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and UNK thou to me and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it UNK us to UNK all UNK STOP 
START then he suffered him STOP 
START and jesus when he was baptized went up UNK out of the water and lo the UNK were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god UNK like a UNK and lighting upon him STOP 
START clearer meaning certainly the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with biblical UNK in the new english bible which reads then jesus arrived at UNK from UNK and he came to john to be baptized by him STOP 
START john tried to UNK him STOP 
START do you come to me said i need rather to be baptized by you STOP 
START jesus replied let it be so for the present do well to UNK this way with all that god requires STOP 
START john then allowed him to come STOP 
START after UNK jesus came up out of the water at once and at that moment heaven opened saw the spirit of god UNK like a UNK to UNK upon him the UNK UNK and UNK are UNK as printed in each version STOP 
START among the most frequently quoted biblical sentences are the UNK and yet so few persons other than scholars really understand the true meaning of these eight UNK UNK by jesus at the beginning of the sermon on the mount STOP 
START to illustrate the first UNK in the king james bible reads blessed are the poor in spirit UNK is the kingdom of heaven STOP 
START the new version states how UNK are those who know that they are poor kingdom of heaven is theirs STOP 
START some of the poetic UNK of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one but almost anyone with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the meaning without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar STOP 
START to a UNK that is significant STOP 
START in the second and third chapters of revelation the new version UNK however the old phrase angel of the church which biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop STOP 
START this is not contemporary english STOP 
START mostly contemporary for the most part however the new version is contemporary and as such should be the means for many to attain a clearer UNK of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of christ STOP 
START originally recorded by hand these words have been UNK and UNK translated and UNK through the ages STOP 
START UNK recently made of old biblical UNK in UNK and greek and other ancient writings some by the early church fathers in themselves called for a UNK of the bible STOP 
START to have the results recorded in everyday UNK english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth STOP 
START there is one danger however STOP 
START with contemporary english changing with the UNK that marks this jet age some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become UNK STOP 
START the only answer will be continuous study STOP 
START the new testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the church of england church of scotland methodist church congregational union baptist union presbyterian church of england churches in UNK churches in ireland society of friends british and foreign bible society and national society of scotland STOP

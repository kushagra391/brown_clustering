START it was not until we had returned to the city to live while i was still at brown and UNK that i felt the full impact of UNK christianity STOP 
START i came under the spell of a younger group in the church led by the UNK older son STOP 
START the spirit of this group was that we were and are living in a world UNK to eternal punishment but that god through jesus christ has provided a way of escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation STOP 
START there are millions who accept this doctrine but few indeed are those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on their souls night and day STOP 
START this group in park place church was made up of the earnest few STOP 
START i was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns and responsibilities STOP 
START i engaged more and more in religious activities STOP 
START besides church and sunday school i went to UNK meetings on the sidewalk at the church door STOP 
START i went to an afternoon service at the aj STOP 
START i went to the christian UNK society and to the evening service of the church STOP 
START much of this lacked the active support of the pastor STOP 
START the young people were UNK and i was UNK STOP 
START once or twice my father asked me if i wasn't UNK a bit in my UNK STOP 
START meanwhile i myself was not yet saved STOP 
START at least i had been unable to lay hold on the experience of conversion STOP 
START try as i might to confess my sins and accept salvation no answer came to me from heaven STOP 
START finally after years i gave up STOP 
START the basic difficulty i suppose was in my ultimate inability to feel a burden of sin from which i sought relief STOP 
START i was familiar with UNK progress which i read as literature STOP 
START no load of sin had been laid on my shoulders nor did earnest effort enable me to become conscious of one STOP 
START there is of course the doctrine of original sin which UNK that each of us as individuals UNK of the guilt of our first UNK STOP 
START in the UNK UNK this doctrine is UNK thus in UNK fall we UNK all STOP 
START this doctrine was UNK to my moral sense STOP 
START i did not feel it UNK to expect that the creator would be at least as just as the most UNK of his creatures the doctrine of original sin is compounded of injustice STOP 
START some of these thoughts not all of them have taken organized form in later years STOP 
START the actual UNK force which UNK me from UNK effort was of another sort STOP 
START i became UNK at being so preoccupied with the state of my own miserable soul STOP 
START i found myself becoming one of that group of people who in UNK words are forever UNK into their own UNK UNK asking am i right am i wrong UNK me of the lord's prayer and these words came to mind thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven STOP 
START they have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years which since have passed STOP 
START from that time to this my religious concern is that i might give effective help to the bringing in of god's kingdom on earth STOP 
START i do not claim to be free from sin or from the need for UNK and forgiveness STOP 
START in my experience the assurance of forgiveness comes only when i have UNK to the UNK one and have made as full UNK as i can UNK STOP 
START there was one further step in my religious progress STOP 
START this was taken after i came to live in UNK and it was made under the guidance of the reverend raymond UNK a young preacher who came to the congregational church there at about the same time that i moved from new york STOP 
START his father was a professor at UNK theological UNK and from him he acquired a conviction which he passed along to me that there is in the universe of persons a moral law the law of love which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law STOP 
START it is most important that we recognize the law of love as being UNK in all personal relationships whether individually socially or as between whole nations of people STOP 
START if UNK the law brings order and satisfaction STOP 
START if UNK the result is turmoil and chaos STOP 
START as we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable STOP 
START we can conceive of no alternatives STOP 
START their basis seems deeper than mere authority STOP 
START they are not true because scientists or UNK say they are true STOP 
START it is not the authority of god himself which makes them true STOP 
START because god is what he is the laws of the universe material and spiritual are what they are STOP 
START UNK and law are one and UNK STOP 
START with this conviction the UNK between the sacred and the secular UNK STOP 
START one's daily work becomes sacred since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy STOP 
START in his book civilization and ethics albert UNK faces the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business life for example STOP 
START his ethics UNK possessions as the property of the community of which the individual is sovereign UNK STOP 
START one serves society by conducting a business from which a certain number of employees draw their means of UNK by giving away his property in order to help his fellow man STOP 
START each will decide on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular circumstances of his own life STOP 
START no one is to judge others STOP 
START he is UNK in UNK guilt to the man who finds it necessary to UNK or permit injury to one individual or group for the sake of a larger good STOP 
START for this decision a man must take personal responsibility STOP 
START says he i may never imagine that in the struggle between personal and UNK responsibility it is possible to make a compromise between the ethical and the UNK in the shape of a relative UNK to let the ethical be UNK by the UNK STOP 
START on the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between the two STOP 
START UNK seems in fact to acquire for himself a burden of sin not UNK by adam but UNK in the inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and lesser responsibilities STOP 
START this viewpoint i find interesting but it has never weighed on my soul STOP 
START perhaps it should have STOP 
START my own experience has followed simpler lines STOP 
START an UNK belief in the moral law has the advantage of making religion natural even as physical law is natural STOP 
START neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels any UNK in UNK the laws of matter and energy nor can he achieve a sense of UNK in such UNK STOP 
START to UNK the moral law is just ordinary common sense applied to a neglected field STOP 
START religion thus becomes integrated with life STOP 
START this truth that the moral law is natural has other important UNK STOP 
START one of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life STOP 
START in seeking for such meaning and purpose albert UNK seized upon the concept of the UNK of life STOP 
START it is UNK to the UNK mind to mine at least to assign UNK to animal insect and plant life STOP 
START these lives are in themselves outside of the moral order and are UNK with moral responsibility STOP 
START there is indeed a moral responsibility on man himself for his own UNK sake to respect lower life and to avoid the UNK of suffering but this viewpoint UNK rejects STOP 
START so far as UNK UNK in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality whether in UNK africa or in washington d.c. STOP 
START one cannot read the records of scientists officials and UNK who have UNK to the minds of the most savage races without realizing that each individual met with is a person STOP 
START read for instance in UNK UNK UNK people of UNK and her wise father UNK UNK and her final adjustment to UNK civilization STOP 
START above all read in UNK UNK the last UNK show the old man of the UNK UNK not UNK in central australia gave to the white man his UNK possession while the tears UNK down his face STOP 
START the UNK UNK is the conventional UNK of UNK humanity here was a depth of UNK which is lacking in a considerable portion of the UNK of our civilization STOP 
START persons whether white black brown or yellow are a concern of god STOP 
START respect for personality is a privilege and a duty for us as brothers STOP 
START such is the field for UNK our UNK STOP 
START as to our action let us UNK ourselves with the purpose expressed by jesus in the lord's prayer thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven STOP 
START with the knowledge that the kingdom comes by UNK to the moral law in our relations with all people we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means and the ends of our lives STOP 
START this intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well because i was never content to lead a divided life STOP 
START as i have said words from UNK remain ever in my memory that mind and soul according well may make one music as before STOP 
START let us now give some thought to the soul STOP 
START when the young UNK dr. UNK began to show interest in our daughter elizabeth this induced a corresponding interest on our part in him STOP 
START i asked one day what he was doing STOP 
START he told me that he had a big UNK and a little UNK and that he was UNK a big eye of the big UNK onto the little UNK and a little eye of the little UNK onto the big UNK STOP 
START he was then noting that the big eye on the little UNK hung back until the little eye had grown up to it while the little eye on the big UNK grew rapidly until it was as big as the other STOP 
START then i asked what does that teach you he it teaches me to wonder STOP 
START this was a profound statement STOP 
START in the face of the UNK universe our ultimate attitude is that of wonder STOP 
START wonder is indeed the intellectual UNK to the spiritual world STOP 
START gone are the days when in the nineteenth century scientists thought that they were close to the UNK of complete knowledge of the physical universe STOP 
START for them only a little more needed to be learned and then all physical knowledge could be neatly UNK UNK and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human problem STOP 
START this UNK was UNK to bits by the UNK of UNK the revelation of the complex UNK of the atom and the discovery of the expanding universe STOP 
START none of these UNK were neatly rounded off bits of knowledge STOP 
START each faded out into the UNK areas of the future STOP 
START it is as if we in our center of human observation from time to time UNK more deeply into the unknown STOP 
START as our UNK of penetration r increases the area of new knowledge increases by af and the total of human knowledge becomes measured in terms of af STOP 
START wonder grows STOP 
START it is endless STOP 
START there are some people intelligent people who seem to be UNK by the sea of wonder in which we are UNK and in which we spend our lives STOP 
START one such is UNK UNK the writer of a recent book speaking of man STOP 
START this is a UNK denial of the spiritual world and a vigorous defense of pure UNK STOP 
START his inability to wonder UNK his argument STOP 
START the subject of immortality brings to mind a vivid incident which took place in UNK at UNK in switzerland STOP

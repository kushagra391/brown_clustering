START all false gods UNK UNK at least in the early phases of their careers so it would be UNK to expect any form of UNK to become widespread without the UNK of human sacrifice STOP 
START but there is reason in all things and in this country the UNK cult of the UNK is UNK all UNK in its demands STOP 
START the annual UNK of UNK american men women and children to UNK its UNK is excessive UNK of UNK a year would be more than sufficient STOP 
START no other popular UNK is UNK even that much grace STOP 
START if the railroads for example regularly UNK UNK passengers each year the high priests of the cult would have cause to UNK for their personal safety for such a UNK would UNK demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states STOP 
START but by comparison with the railroad the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the UNK of civilized usage quickly and easily STOP 
START yet it is plainly time to make a start and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic without being UNK STOP 
START here then is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning STOP 
START from next new year's day let us keep careful account of each successive UNK on the highways UNK it on all media of communication STOP 
START to avoid suspicion of UNK let the hand of UNK be stayed until the UNK has picked up the twenty-five UNK UNK let the twenty-five thousand and first UNK be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners STOP 
START then let the whole lot be UNK in a public mass execution on july 4 UNK STOP 
START the scene of course should be nine miles northwest of UNK illinois the geographical center of population according to the census STOP 
START a special UNK protected by UNK from the UNK sun of illinois should be erected for UNK by honored guests who should include the UNK of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized STOP 
START the band should play the UNK march as a UNK UNK to UNK columbia happy land the trap is UNK STOP 
START independence day is the appropriate date as a UNK UNK of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain UNK rights the first of which is life and when any government becomes UNK of that end it is the right of the people to alter or UNK it STOP 
START the highway system is an agency of government and when it UNK up UNK americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do STOP 
START hanging the responsible officials would not UNK the government but would emphasize its UNK for the lives of its individual citizens which would certainly alter it and definitely for the better STOP 
START moreover the UNK effects would not be exclusively political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social STOP 
START it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its UNK beliefs and practices for instance the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from UNK to UNK not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of UNK or as it is generally termed staying put STOP 
START true the UNK of staying put are now reduced to a minor even a UNK UNK and their UNK UNK hearts are UNK is as UNK as UNK STOP 
START UNK although few in number they are a stubborn crew as UNK of life as the UNK UNK which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle UNK in their faith STOP 
START perhaps there is more truth than we are UNK to admit in the conviction of that UNK of UNK robert UNK grandfather who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is all this UNK STOP 
START in any event the yearly sacrifice of UNK victims is a UNK too large to be justified by the most ardent faith STOP 
START somehow our contemporary UNK must be induced to see reason STOP 
START since appeals to morality to humanity and to UNK have had such small effect perhaps our last UNK is the UNK example STOP 
START if we make it established custom that whenever UNK on the highways grows excessive say beyond UNK per UNK then somebody is going to hang it follows that the more UNK the victim the more impressive the lesson STOP 
START to hang 50 UNK might be UNK except that they are not directly related to the highways all things considered the highway commissioners would seem to be elected STOP 
START as the new clouds of UNK fallout spread silently and UNK around the earth the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race STOP 
START but the guilt is shared by the united states britain and france the other members of the atomic club STOP 
START until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 the us and UNK had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians and the fallout from the earlier UNK is still coming down STOP 
START as it UNK the concentration of UNK UNK up in the human body a dose of radiation is not like a UNK virus which causes temporary UNK and then dies STOP 
START the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years and on to UNK generations STOP 
START so while we properly UNK against the new UNK history is not likely to justify the pose of UNK which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr. khrushchev made his UNK and UNK threat STOP 
START shock UNK and UNK for future generations were legitimate reactions UNK sermon was not STOP 
START on october 19 after the soviets had UNK at least 20 nuclear devices ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country in self protection might have to resume UNK tests STOP 
START more recently the chairman of the atomic energy commission dr. UNK t. UNK admitted to a news conference in UNK UNK UNK that the us might fall behind russia he apparently meant in weapons development if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we UNK STOP 
START the trial UNK are UNK STOP 
START all of which makes it more UNK than ever that the biological and UNK effects of fallout be understood STOP 
START but for the average citizen unfortunately this is one of UNK UNK channels full of UNK UNK and unknown depths STOP 
START the scientists in and out of government do not agree on some of the most vital points at least publicly STOP 
START on the one hand the public health service declared as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots do not warrant undue public concern or any action to limit the UNK of UNK substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj STOP 
START but the UNK conceded that the new UNK particles will add to the risk of UNK effects in UNK generations and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states STOP 
START then it added it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be nor how many people will be affected STOP 
START having UNK its UNK in this way UNK apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all at present radiation levels and even at somewhat higher levels the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected STOP 
START then to conclude on an UNK note nevertheless if fallout increased substantially or remained high for a long time it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world STOP 
START dr. UNK UNK a UNK prize UNK in chemistry has been less ambiguous whether you choose to agree with him or not STOP 
START after UNK in an article last month in frontier magazine that the russian testing carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world he gave this estimate of the UNK and UNK consequences if the new soviet shots UNK 200 UNK the damage to human UNK UNK would be such that in the next few generations UNK children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects STOP 
START UNK UNK from the fusion process would cause four million UNK UNK or childhood UNK and UNK over the next 20 generations and between UNK and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by UNK diseases such as UNK STOP 
START most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout is UNK STOP 
START UNK estimate of 200 UNK yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high but a total of 100 UNK is a distinct possibility STOP 
START the lack of scientific UNK on the effects of radiation is due in part to UNK data covering large population groups from which UNK UNK could be drawn STOP 
START but more than one UNK UNK has been UNK from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less UNK fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem STOP 
START its dangerous effects have been UNK to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing STOP 
START an illustration of this attitude is found in john a. UNK letter to dr. thomas UNK reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic STOP 
START to this day the atomic energy commission UNK away from discussing the health aspects of fallout STOP 
START a recent study on radiation exposure by the UNK division of UNK and medicine stated the question of the biological effect of radiation doses is not considered UNK STOP 
START of course the UNK is in a UNK now STOP 
START if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout it will box the president on UNK UNK tests STOP 
START so the UNK UNK of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two UNK sentences with the UNK yield usually left vague STOP 
START now of course that the russians are the nuclear UNK radiation is a UNK word than it was in the UNK when the us was testing in the atmosphere STOP 
START the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout if not exactly good for you might not be much worse than a bad cold STOP 
START after a nuclear blast one UNK suggested in those UNK days about all you had to do was UNK out the UNK and sweep off your UNK and roof STOP 
START things aren't that simple UNK STOP 
START yet if washington gets too UNK about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast UNK if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count STOP 
START how much fallout will we get of october 25 the UNK had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series 12 of them in a UNK range including a UNK bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 UNK the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of UNK president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported STOP 
START assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at 10 UNK a conservative UNK is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 UNK STOP 
START some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 UNK and that the full UNK bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be UNK STOP 
START if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests the shots were roughly half UNK and half fusion meaning a UNK yield of 30 to 40 UNK thus far STOP 
START to this must be added the 90 to UNK UNK of UNK yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal UNK test UNK that began in november 1958 STOP

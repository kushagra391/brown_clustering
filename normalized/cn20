START they were west of the UNK but only god knew where STOP 
START for three days their UNK UNK had UNK up a UNK valley as flat and UNK as a dead sea STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK their UNK an angry UNK air UNK their strength and strained their nerves to UNK UNK their UNK and lay like acid in their lungs STOP 
START and the valley stretched UNK out ahead UNK and UNK and UNK in its heat until it vanished into the UNK wall of UNK orange brown UNK STOP 
START ben prime extended his UNK stride until he could lay his UNK across the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START UNK commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips STOP 
START he removed his hat to let the UNK sweat cut UNK through the dust film upon his UNK face STOP 
START he UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK came from his mouth like UNK cotton STOP 
START he moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing UNK the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his UNK UNK STOP 
START the burning air dried his UNK clothes in UNK UNK STOP 
START he cleared his throat and wet his lips STOP 
START as UNK as possible he said well i guess we could all do with a little drink STOP 
START he UNK the UNK and drew water from a barrel STOP 
START they could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by UNK STOP 
START the water was warm and UNK and had a UNK taste STOP 
START but it was water STOP 
START thank the lord they still had water UNK his mouth with a small quantity STOP 
START he took a long but carefully controlled UNK STOP 
START he UNK the UNK and handed it to his young wife riding the UNK deck STOP 
START she took it UNK her dark eyes UNK as they met his STOP 
START she drank and pushed back her UNK UNK to wet a UNK and UNK her face STOP 
START she set the UNK on the edge of the deck leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on UNK STOP 
START what happens when there's no more water asked UNK STOP 
START she was like charcoal he thought dark UNK explosive STOP 
START her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal STOP 
START her temper UNK like charcoal when it first lights up STOP 
START and all the time she had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its under side but not UNK STOP 
START a UNK ran through the muscles of his UNK but he kept control upon his voice STOP 
START there must be some water under there STOP 
START he tilted his UNK face toward the dry bed of the river STOP 
START we can get it if we UNK he said UNK STOP 
START and add fever to our troubles UNK STOP 
START or do you want to see if i can stand fever too we can boil it he said STOP 
START her chin UNK STOP 
START we're lost and burning up already she bit out UNK STOP 
START the tires are UNK on the wheels now STOP 
START they'll roll off in another day STOP 
START there was no valley like this on your map STOP 
START you don't even know where we're headed STOP 
START UNK he said as gently as he could we're still headed west STOP 
START somewhere we'll hit a trail STOP 
START somewhere she repeated STOP 
START maybe in time to make a cross and UNK our UNK STOP 
START his wide mouth UNK STOP 
START in a way he couldn't blame her STOP 
START he had picked out this UNK trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on their honeymoon STOP 
START it had been a mistake but anything would have been a mistake as it turned out STOP 
START it wasn't the UNK and UNK and UNK of the trip that had frightened her STOP 
START she had hated the whole idea before they started STOP 
START actually she had hated him before she ever saw him STOP 
START it had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a UNK of UNK administered by her mother STOP 
START the bitterness of their wedding night still UNK within him like an open wound STOP 
START she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a UNK STOP 
START he had left her UNK thinking familiarity would gentle her in time STOP 
START but each mile UNK she had hated him the deeper STOP 
START he stared at the UNK turning it over and over in his wide UNK hands STOP 
START i suppose he muttered i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement STOP 
START don't try to be noble laugh was hard STOP 
START they wouldn't have sold me in the first place if UNK been food enough to go around STOP 
START he UNK STOP 
START UNK they didn't sell you he said UNK STOP 
START they knew i was a good UNK farmer back in carolina but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our own STOP 
START they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them STOP 
START without money or property what would you have had at UNK UNK i might have UNK but at least i wouldn't be UNK to a UNK and UNK with dirt UNK under his heavy burn STOP 
START his blue eyes sought the UNK sea of UNK ahead STOP 
START to his UNK there suddenly was no UNK STOP 
START the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the UNK line of UNK UNK hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead STOP 
START then he noticed the clouds racing upon them heavy ominous UNK clouds that formed even as they UNK over the UNK of the surrounding hills STOP 
START he had never seen clouds like them before but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a UNK in carolina STOP 
START he UNK UNK hang on UNK the UNK as he yelled STOP 
START he wanted to turn them putting the wagon against the storm STOP 
START too late he realized that in turning he had UNK them onto a patch of UNK ground instead of UNK a grade or ridge STOP 
START he swung up over the wheel STOP 
START you had better get inside he warned her STOP 
START but she sat on in stubborn silence STOP 
START the clouds UNK downward and burst suddenly into a great black UNK STOP 
START frozen they stared at it UNK down the valley UNK and UNK out UNK and UNK of earth like a UNK UNK dog cracking UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK began to whip and shake STOP 
START their world turned black STOP 
START it was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence STOP 
START the UNK opened UNK them with UNK the size of UNK STOP 
START and then came the water not rain but solid sheets that UNK down like water UNK from a UNK STOP 
START walls of water rushed down the UNK and filled the UNK like the UNK of flash UNK STOP 
START through the UNK of the rising waters they could hear the roar of the river as it UNK through its canyon UNK big UNK out of the banks STOP 
START the UNK UNK surface of the river reached the level of the UNK STOP 
START the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising STOP 
START they UNK under UNK covers listening to the waves UNK against the bottom STOP 
START the UNK cut off abruptly STOP 
START they were UNK by the UNK silence broken only by the low angry UNK of the river STOP 
START then the darkness UNK and there was light again and then bright sunlight STOP 
START beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawled to the UNK deck and looked out UNK at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills STOP 
START the water level was higher than their UNK STOP 
START only the heavy bones of the UNK kept them UNK STOP 
START there was no real sign of the river now just a UNK UNK ribbon of liquid movement through UNK waters that reached everywhere STOP 
START UNK of brush rode down the ribbon STOP 
START now and then the UNK side of a UNK object showed as it swept past STOP 
START the girl crawled out into the UNK warmth of the UNK UNK her shoulders and still trembling STOP 
START her face was pale but set and her dark eyes UNK with blame for ben STOP 
START out of UNK to say something UNK ben prime UNK well we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first UNK hit STOP 
START at least the wheels dug in STOP 
START the UNK will put life back in the wagon too STOP 
START his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard STOP 
START she was watching a tree ride wildly down that UNK current STOP 
START somebody was riding the tree STOP 
START it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting UNK an upright branch STOP 
START she did not call out STOP 
START but as the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell STOP 
START they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend STOP 
START it UNK up into the air then UNK back the UNK branch turned slowly STOP 
START the pale UNK of the woman disappeared STOP 
START there's the one who's lucky girl murmured UNK STOP 
START UNK eyes strained with the bitter hurt his UNK face UNK with gray and UNK STOP 
START then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the UNK UNK their comfort more than they needed his STOP 
START it was nearly UNK and he went to the back of the wagon UNK his way for he was not a tall man STOP 
START he let down the UNK and was knocked over by the UNK of water STOP 
START he UNK back to his feet and UNK UNK to pull his UNK of seed grain forward STOP 
START they were already swollen to bursting STOP 
START of all their UNK UNK next to the UNK and his gun the seed grain had been the most UNK STOP 
START it was UNK now for seed and it would UNK and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it STOP 
START the UNK might as well enjoy it STOP 
START he examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished STOP 
START the waters lay UNK but UNK without a UNK of movement against the wheels was not a UNK of damp mark to show they were UNK STOP 
START he UNK if a man could UNK as far as the UNK dry hills that UNK the valley STOP 
START a terrible UNK sense of UNK swept over him STOP 
START he gripped the wheel hard to fight the UNK of defeat STOP 
START then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen STOP 
START the UNK were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece STOP 
START hope UNK within him STOP 
START he swung toward the front to give the news to UNK then stopped UNK from her by the UNK of her blame and hate STOP 
START still he felt better STOP 
START a tight wagon meant so much STOP 
START he got a small fire started and put on UNK and coffee STOP 
START he poured the water off the UNK and off the UNK UNK the UNK UNK UNK for UNK of a sort STOP 
START their UNK and UNK had not suffered STOP 
START he found a jar of preserved UNK and one of eggs that they had meant to save STOP 
START now he broke them open hoping a good meal might UNK this depression UNK UNK STOP 
START his long nose UNK at the UNK of UNK UNK and heating UNK but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time STOP 
START he UNK the UNK sides of the canvas UNK leaving the ribs and wagon open STOP 
START he looked thoughtfully at his wife's UNK holding her UNK UNK STOP 
START he said UNK UNK i don't figure your things got wet too much STOP 
START that's a good UNK STOP 
START if you want to get them UNK she said without turning her head after that rain beating in UNK the dust there isn't a thing that won't be UNK STOP 
START he drew a long breath and opened the UNK and hung out her clothes and UNK upon the wagon ribs STOP

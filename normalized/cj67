START anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the UNK of verse in the heroic age STOP 
START UNK court UNK UNK of the UNK at UNK lines UNK UNK and UNK the tale of UNK UNK in a UNK comparison of the UNK visitor with UNK lines UNK UNK court UNK UNK of the discovered UNK of UNK and UNK odyssey 8 UNK and takes up a tale of UNK while the UNK UNK UNK on odyssey 8 UNK STOP 
START nothing in all this is UNK unlike the poets of UNK and UNK the poet of beowulf is not concerned with his own identity poet of the odyssey UNK blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind UNK UNK STOP 
START since none of these UNK of UNK without writing is intended to UNK a UNK into the epic matter there is UNK evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition STOP 
START that such a tradition lies behind the iliad and the odyssey at least is hard to deny STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK defended the observation that the UNK homeric poems are largely formulaic and was led to UNK that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete UNK of greek epic survived further UNK that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely UNK that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas STOP 
START proceeding from UNK conclusions and adopting one of his UNK francis p. UNK jr. UNK that beowulf likewise was created from a UNK of oral formulas inherited and extended by UNK of successive generations and the UNK is striking and UNK STOP 
START yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment beowulf and the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent STOP 
START the UNK UNK by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very UNK oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in UNK could be composed without extreme difficulty even in a language of many terminal UNK STOP 
START UNK seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of UNK declares that a song of UNK was UNK before the battle UNK at UNK STOP 
START the anglo-saxon UNK line and the homeric UNK probably imposed less of a restraint verse of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents UNK in UNK a UNK STOP 
START yet certain aids were valuable and quite UNK necessary for UNK long UNK of verse without a pause STOP 
START the poet in a written tradition who generally never UNK a line may once in a while pause and polish without UNK blame STOP 
START but the oral poet cannot pause must UNK continuously with no apparent effort STOP 
START even though the UNK of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for him often to be seriously UNK unless he has aids to UNK rapid composition STOP 
START the UNK poet had such aids in the UNK which provided for the difficulties of UNK homeric poet had UNK which provided for UNK needs in the UNK STOP 
START either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he UNK out his lines because the UNK and the UNK made possible the construction of systems of numerous UNK for the chief common and proper UNK STOP 
START other UNK could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i shall speak of UNK and UNK in the UNK and UNK possible sense and name for example UNK a UNK for the UNK STOP 
START verbal and UNK elements too participated in each epic UNK but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and UNK supply of UNK UNK and to UNK the members of any system of UNK as basic formulas of the poetic language STOP 
START limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon as in the other UNK UNK we cannot say how frequently the UNK in beowulf UNK in contemporary epic on the same soil STOP 
START but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before him would seem unlikely to UNK a technique based upon frequent and substantial UNK the UNK like the UNK must reasonably be UNK to an oral tradition STOP 
START one of the greatest UNK of our time frederick m. UNK UNK that when it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems the UNK single UNK called homer cannot be either credited with or denied UNK in choice of UNK STOP 
START any example of grand or UNK UNK may have been created by the poet who UNK numerous UNK into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown UNK STOP 
START the quest of the historical homer is likely never to have further success individual word in the iliad or the odyssey can be credited to any one man UNK effective element of speech in the UNK poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the UNK epic UNK that may have existed at the beginning of the first UNK before christ STOP 
START this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well STOP 
START to the extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although UNK in an oral tradition is less a UNK than the standard UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK further and here he makes his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry homeric critics are UNK of an entire UNK they previously found UNK STOP 
START with a few important and a few more UNK exceptions no expression can be deemed le UNK UNK for its context because each was very probably the only expression that UNK practice and ease of rapid UNK would allow STOP 
START words or phrases that UNK have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable UNK sometimes accurate and sometimes not STOP 
START this observation too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry STOP 
START to the extent that a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other UNK STOP 
START w. f. bryan suggests that certain UNK in beowulf were selected sometimes for UNK and sometimes for ironic UNK but such a view would appear UNK unless it is denied that the language of beowulf is formulaic STOP 
START if the master of UNK who was most responsible for the poem ever used UNK that were traditional he was at least partly UNK of free will and not inclined towards UNK and sophisticated UNK of speech elements STOP 
START once many significant phrases are found in theory or in UNK practice to provide for UNK necessity they are not to be defended for their UNK properties in isolated UNK STOP 
START it is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of beowulf such effects as UNK irony STOP 
START yet if the argument is turned UNK there may be found a great deal in UNK view after all STOP 
START a formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection STOP 
START UNK though the UNK expressions are they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous STOP 
START a long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things and these formulas are therefore UNK rather than always actually accurate STOP 
START true we do not know how they were regarded in their day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more UNK to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read UNK or homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to UNK in occasional UNK of the most familiar phrases STOP 
START UNK and UNK in a written tradition are chosen for the UNK an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic UNK and tend towards UNK rather than distinctive UNK STOP 
START UNK is therefore not to be placed upon the UNK UNK in an oral poem today would hope to discover the UNK UNK of UNK or the palace of UNK STOP 
START a ship at UNK could be called a UNK UNK in anglo-saxon or a swift ship in greek STOP 
START even when UNK of weapons the UNK would be UNK as their king is UNK and UNK would be UNK STOP 
START UNK like UNK in the UNK is UNK the UNK of men and may accordingly be called UNK even when he stands idle STOP 
START in UNK the UNK of UNK is used deliberately and UNK but the homeric UNK and the anglo-saxon UNK are used casually and recall to the UNK a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the UNK STOP 
START the epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet was partly his master STOP 
START the poet's intentions are difficult to UNK and except to UNK UNK language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the effects of the language are UNK even if sometimes inevitable STOP 
START beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral UNK STOP 
START yet they are written some stage in their evolution they were UNK STOP 
START albert b. lord suggests that the homeric poems were UNK to a UNK by a UNK who held in his mind the poems fully UNK but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his UNK and UNK UNK that the beowulf poet and UNK may have UNK their verse in the same fashion STOP 
START this explanation is attractive but is UNK at least in part by the observation that UNK though he used UNK in the traditional manner was a UNK man who four times UNK his name by UNK into his works STOP 
START if UNK was UNK the beowulf poet may have been also and so may the final UNK of the iliad and the odyssey STOP 
START in UNK of the UNK to the blind or UNK UNK one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry UNK and became UNK familiar with the established aids to UNK and himself wrote his own UNK or his edition of the UNK of the past STOP 
START other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory beowulf may contain a design for terror and the iliad may have a vast UNK pattern answering to a UNK pattern produced during the geometric period in pottery STOP 
START the account of the growth and final UNK of these UNK rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic STOP 
START carl UNK UNK counted UNK different lines repeated exactly in the two homeric poems and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight UNK he counted UNK different lines used a total of UNK times STOP 
START thus one line in five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poems STOP 
START the ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the lines are so long half again as long as those of beowulf STOP 
START anglo-saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition is no reason to think that the UNK used and UNK whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric UNK STOP 
START in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their UNK for a stock of UNK would be sufficient to permit the poet to UNK with UNK if they provided for UNK needs STOP 
START the UNK scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon UNK and the homeric UNK any words or phrases are formulaic they will be STOP 
START the iliad has two words for the UNK UNK and UNK STOP

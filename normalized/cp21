START two letters had arrived for miss theresa UNK she put them in her bag STOP 
START she would not stop to read them in american express as many were doing sitting on UNK or leaning against the walls but pushed her way out into the street STOP 
START this was her first day in rome and it was june STOP 
START an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead STOP 
START in her UNK eye her imagination UNK fully almost UNK to these UNK peculiar powers of stimulation she saw the city as from above UNK on its great bare plains that the UNK marked UNK and UNK here a UNK there a pine and all around the low blue hills STOP 
START pictures in old latin books returned to her the UNK way today the UNK the arch of UNK STOP 
START she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight STOP 
START moreover nursing various UNK her aunt then her mother then her father through their lengthy UNK everybody could tell you the UNK were always sick theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot STOP 
START england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of UNK and UNK she had conceived a UNK passion by UNK to see all these places with her own eyes STOP 
START the very night after her father's funeral she had thought though never admitted to a soul now i can go STOP 
START there's nothing to stop me now STOP 
START so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly UNK STOP 
START in the street the traffic was really frightening STOP 
START cars UNK UNK and UNK all went UNK at once down the narrow length of it or UNK UNK around a fountain STOP 
START UNK of tourists went by her in national groups english school girls in blue uniforms german boys with UNK attached UNK dressed americans looking in shop windows STOP 
START glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor UNK that opened to her left STOP 
START the spanish steps STOP 
START something special was going on here just now the annual display of UNK plants STOP 
START she had heard about it the night before at her hotel STOP 
START it was not yet complete UNK were UNK the UNK plants from a truck and placing them in UNK rows on the steps above STOP 
START the UNK were as large as UNK and their UNK UNK many still tight in the UNK ranged in color from purple through UNK and rose to the UNK pink along with many white ones too STOP 
START marvelous thought theresa climbing in her UNK UNK way for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything STOP 
START in rome all over europe she intended to move very slowly indeed STOP 
START halfway up the UNK she stopped and sat down STOP 
START other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide UNK and leaning over the UNK above watching the UNK mass or just enjoying the sun STOP 
START theresa sat with her letters in her lap breathing UNK air STOP 
START the sun UNK her as it seemed to be UNK everything perhaps even the UNK of stones or the chill UNK of churches STOP 
START she UNK her UNK jacket and UNK a cigarette STOP 
START content excited could you be both at once but she was STOP 
START presently she picked up the first of the letters STOP 
START a few moments later her hands were trembling and her UNK had UNK with anxiety and UNK STOP 
START of course one of them would have to go and do this cousin UNK she thought tears rising to UNK in the sun but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her STOP 
START her cousin UNK UNK had written it in her loose high old UNK script UNK carefully crossed but UNK inclined to UNK like an old car on the downward slope STOP 
START cousin UNK had simply put miss theresa UNK rome italy on the envelope had walked up to the post office in UNK alabama and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her UNK neighbor STOP 
START no return address UNK STOP 
START somebody had UNK american express piazza di UNK across the envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope STOP 
START inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander UNK STOP 
START cousin UNK and cousin UNK brother and sister UNK devoted UNK had lived next door to the UNK in UNK from time UNK until the UNK had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago STOP 
START two days before he was taken sick cousin UNK was out UNK about what too much rain might do to his UNK and cousin UNK had always preserved in the top UNK of his secretary a UNK paper knife which theresa had UNK as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died STOP 
START i'm supposed to care as much now as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh STOP 
START this letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put rome italy on it STOP 
START she UNK the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george STOP 
START but UNK george when he had written had only just returned from going to UNK to cousin UNK funeral STOP 
START he was full of heavy family UNK STOP 
START all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world today STOP 
START his own children had suffered from the UNK of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his UNK he had one so far still in UNK he UNK to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all STOP 
START a life of UNK and principle such as cousin UNK had lived had to be known at first hand STOP 
START poor george only boy the family darling STOP 
START together with her mother both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong STOP 
START theresa had seen him through the right college into the right UNK and though pursued by various girls and various UNK of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george STOP 
START could it just be theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull for cousin alexander UNK the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him except his paper knife was that he had had UNK long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole UNK family had been aroused to go next door at cousin UNK call first papa then mother then theresa and george STOP 
START there they all did their UNK to help cousin UNK get a UNK out of his foot STOP 
START he had UNK downstairs into the parlor in his UNK and was sitting wrapped in his UNK on a UNK STOP 
START he held his long UNK foot in both hands and this and his UNK face he was trying UNK not to cry out made him look like a large UNK old UNK STOP 
START they all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have UNK and cousin UNK running back and forth with a UNK of hot water which she poured UNK into a white UNK pan STOP 
START can you think of anything to do kept UNK STOP 
START i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up i'll just have to you think of anything to do you might treat it like the UNK said papa STOP 
START drop a cold key down his back STOP 
START i just hope this happens to you someday said cousin UNK who was not at his best STOP 
START poor cousin UNK george said STOP 
START he was younger than theresa she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not UNK STOP 
START poor cousin UNK STOP 
START now here they both were still the same george full of UNK UNK and cousin UNK in despair STOP 
START theresa shifted to a new page STOP 
START of course UNK letter continued there are practical problems to be considered STOP 
START cousin UNK is alone in that big old house and won't hear to UNK from it STOP 
START UNK and UNK tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them and anne and i have told her she's more than welcome here but i think she feels that she might be an UNK especially as long as our UNK is still in high school STOP 
START the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that UNK is populated with miss UNK UNK for example STOP 
START but there is more in this than meets the eye STOP 
START a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in STOP 
START the UNK in the back bedroom is literally UNK off STOP 
START theresa UNK a page of details about the house STOP 
START i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them STOP 
START i may settle on some UNK arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best STOP 
START i really shouldn't have UNK a cigarette so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick STOP 
START i'll start UNK in a minute sitting on these cold steps STOP 
START she got up standing UNK for a moment then moving aside to let go past her talking a group of young men STOP 
START they wore shoes with pointed toes odd to american eyes and narrow UNK and their hair looked UNK black and UNK STOP 
START yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome and felt themselves to be so STOP 
START just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap UNK parker fountain UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START no said theresa STOP 
START no no said STOP 
START the man did not wish to leave STOP 
START he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them STOP 
START UNK UNK in the park the UNK by moonlight he specialized STOP 
START theresa turned away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two STOP 
START there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of UNK while the UNK picked himself another UNK american lady carrying a camera and a handsome UNK bag UNK the steps alone STOP 
START was he ever successful theresa wondered STOP 
START the lady with the UNK bag registered interest doubt then UNK last alarm STOP 
START she cast about as though looking for a policeman this really shouldn't be allowed she UNK away up the steps STOP 
START theresa UNK still holding the family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in family circles as an UNK between cousin UNK death and doing something about cousin UNK STOP 
START they were even anne and george probably thinking themselves very UNK in not UNK that she really should cut out one or two countries and come home in august to get cousin UNK house ready before the teachers came to UNK in september STOP 
START of course it wasn't anne and UNK fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another and weren't they always UNK that they really didn't know what they would do without theresa trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter UNK nothing here is supposed even to exist STOP 
START they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow STOP 
START it never registered with them that i had time to read all of UNK dickens and UNK while papa was dying not to mention everything in the city library after mother's operation STOP 
START it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all UNK volumes of UNK UNK STOP 
START she arranged the letters carefully one on top of the other STOP 
START then with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself she tore them in two STOP 
START UNK became aware that two italian UNK carrying a large UNK pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK ma UNK STOP 
START oh put it there indicated a spot a little distance away STOP

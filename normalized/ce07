START the design of a mechanical UNK frame is much like a mechanical UNK but once understood the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement STOP 
START in the frame are two sets of bars which UNK with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves STOP 
START the main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet is connected to each lever STOP 
START if the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch the tappet moves a short distance UNK at the same time STOP 
START close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars STOP 
START these can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets STOP 
START the number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented STOP 
START in the sides of the tappets are UNK with UNK sides and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of UNK called dogs STOP 
START two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar STOP 
START these slide into and out of the UNK in the tappets as the tappets are moved locking and UNK them STOP 
START here's how the scheme works suppose the operator UNK the lever to clear a particular signal STOP 
START this also UNK the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the UNK to the side thus moving one or more locking bars STOP 
START the dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into UNK in other tappets STOP 
START by this scheme pulling one signal to clear UNK all the other switch and signal UNK in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal STOP 
START UNK signals are normally at stop or red position and a lever must be pulled to clear the signal STOP 
START this is not necessarily to green however for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the plant STOP 
START there are other basic rules STOP 
START a UNK may have two UNK one to actually move the switch points the other to lock the points STOP 
START a signal cannot be cleared until all the related UNK are properly thrown and locked STOP 
START such UNK are nearly always used where the switch points face UNK traffic STOP 
START the lock UNK that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel UNK will UNK on a partly thrown point STOP 
START if the points aren't thrown all the way the UNK cannot be locked and in turn the signal cannot be cleared STOP 
START generally these UNK on UNK are called facing point UNK STOP 
START figs. UNK show typical arrangements of track and signals STOP 
START each UNK is accompanied by a dog chart a list of the UNK that show which other UNK any particular lever will lock if pulled STOP 
START the lines UNK the UNK dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars STOP 
START by studying the UNK UNK you'll note several other details STOP 
START UNK mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the UNK if a train passes a stop signal are used in many instances STOP 
START home signals have two blades STOP 
START the UNK blades indicate a fixed aspect the blade does not move STOP 
START as an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the distant signal located beyond the limits of the UNK plant STOP 
START in some UNK situations the distant signal is fixed at caution STOP 
START in other instances where there is no automatic block UNK the distant has only green and yellow aspects STOP 
START so much for the UNK STOP 
START the UNK frame we built at the model UNK workshop and then installed on paul UNK railroad follows the fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in fig. 7 page 65 and in the UNK STOP 
START here's how it can be built STOP 
START frame the sizes of pieces needed for the UNK frame are shown in the notes within fig. 7 most of the bars being 1 brass in 1 and 1 UNK STOP 
START you may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer UNK and UNK as you wish STOP 
START our instructions assume you are building this particular frame which is for a UNK STOP 
START when cutting the pieces dress the ends smooth and square with a smooth file or UNK disk STOP 
START start with the UNK piece b af UNK it to the lower piece a of the same material but UNK long STOP 
START let exactly UNK of a extend beyond b and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees STOP 
START now lay 12 pieces of af cut UNK long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1 UNK STOP 
START this gives you the UNK for UNK the UNK piece b STOP 
START UNK the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for b STOP 
START UNK this second b to a at right angles STOP 
START there should be UNK between the two parallel members and each should be UNK from an end of the long piece STOP 
START cap this assembly with UNK bars in place with a af bar STOP 
START UNK all the 1 UNK pieces to the UNK and UNK members STOP 
START these will be UNK and UNK later on STOP 
START now cut five af locking bar UNK which run UNK STOP 
START position these using six intermediate temporary af UNK and locate the upper UNK bar a STOP 
START UNK it and the five locking bar UNK to the frame STOP 
START now place 12 pieces 1 UNK on this edge as we did before and space them with the UNK long tappets as they are called STOP 
START cap with a af bar and UNK in place STOP 
START cap the locking bar UNK with two af directly under the first two b pieces STOP 
START remove all the loose UNK bars STOP 
START mark and UNK all the holes required for UNK to hold this assembly together STOP 
START see fig. 7 STOP 
START placement of these holes is not critical but they should be located so that the centers are about 1 from any edge STOP 
START drill all no. 50 and UNK all except the a pieces size UNK STOP 
START tap the a pieces UNK STOP 
START now UNK and UNK the frame except for the two UNK and the first two UNK bars a and b pieces which are UNK together STOP 
START either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions STOP 
START dress all surfaces with a file cleaning off all UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START drill 20 no. UNK holes in the upper piece a as shown in fig. 7 STOP 
START tap these UNK for mounting the electrical contact later on STOP 
START note 6 and 8 lock UNK don't require holes for contacts STOP 
START now UNK the frame using af UNK steel UNK and nuts STOP 
START put the 12 tappets and some af locking bar UNK in the frame to help UNK all the components before you UNK the UNK STOP 
START be sure the tappets are not UNK by a twisted 1 UNK UNK STOP 
START as an anchor for the spring lock insert a af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in fig. 7 STOP 
START drill a no. UNK hole through the pieces and secure with a UNK nut and screw STOP 
START drill two no. 50 holes one in the insert and one in the locking bar UNK directly above it and tap UNK STOP 
START number all the tappet bars before UNK them so they can be replaced in the same UNK STOP 
START remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth STOP 
START cut five pieces of af brass bar stock UNK long STOP 
START these are supporting members for the short locking bars STOP 
START locate their positions in fig. 7 and drill no. UNK to match the corresponding holes in the frame STOP 
START cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut STOP 
START drill four no. 19 and four no. 28 holes in the UNK long a pieces STOP 
START locate the position from fig. 7 STOP 
START tappets and locking bars UNK no. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective UNK and square the ends STOP 
START break the end corners with a slight 45 degree UNK STOP 
START drill a no. 50 hole UNK from one end and tap UNK STOP 
START see fig. 7 STOP 
START put a UNK UNK screw into the hole cut off the excess UNK and file flush with the UNK of the bar STOP 
START to find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge STOP 
START UNK a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet 1 plus half the diameter of the UNK screw head about 5 away from the frame edge STOP 
START total distance is about 21 STOP 
START tend to make this dimension slightly UNK so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1 tappet movement STOP 
START drill a no. 50 hole tap UNK and insert a UNK UNK screw as you did on the first end STOP 
START drill a no. UNK hole UNK through the tappet at the position shown in figs. 7 and 8 STOP 
START repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars STOP 
START to each tappet except 6 and 8 UNK a af piece of brass and file to the UNK shape shown in figs. 6 and 8 STOP 
START these will serve as UNK UNK for the electrical contacts STOP 
START fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather UNK job since stop UNK tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times STOP 
START as the work UNK the frame and moving parts become a sort of chinese UNK where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is UNK STOP 
START a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth UNK machine when you are finished STOP 
START each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work UNK to insure UNK fitting STOP 
START the order of fitting is not too important STOP 
START however we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back STOP 
START since the same method of UNK and fitting the dogs and UNK is used throughout we will only describe the construction of one locking bar STOP 
START figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions STOP 
START all the bars are cut from af brass STOP 
START the lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of fig. 7 STOP 
START bar c is UNK long STOP 
START UNK the edges square up the ends and put a slight UNK on the edges so they will not UNK in the frame STOP 
START fig. 8 gives the dimensions for UNK the UNK holes STOP 
START UNK and drill the no. 31 hole 7 from one end of the bar STOP 
START chuck a length of 1 UNK drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight UNK 1 long STOP 
START cut the piece about 9 or 5 long and drive it into the no. 31 hole UNK in the locking bar STOP 
START file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1 above the bar STOP 
START this dog will engage a UNK to be cut in tappet 3 STOP 
START place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 STOP 
START UNK a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 parallel to piece a STOP 
START see the drawings for the shape of the UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK lines on the bar and rough out with either a UNK saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool STOP 
START we used the latter equipped with a UNK disk about thick and UNK UNK fitted on a 1 UNK UNK STOP 
START such UNK are very handy for cutting and UNK small parts STOP 
START file to a smooth finish STOP 
START a UNK swiss pattern file is handy since its UNK shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without UNK an adjoining one STOP 
START UNK to get the UNK as much alike as possible STOP 
START the UNK should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it STOP 
START UNK the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the UNK pieces STOP 
START all matching surfaces should be checked frequently and UNK on a cut and fit basis STOP 
START chuck a UNK or UNK piece of 1 UNK drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool STOP 
START fashion a sharp UNK point about 3 long on one end using swiss pattern files STOP 
START this tool can also be made with a UNK STOP

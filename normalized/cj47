START UNK and UNK present evidence that UNK and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple UNK level simply by UNK objects and counting them STOP 
START after they have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of UNK objects do UNK what they once had to do UNK STOP 
START the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age STOP 
START one experiment showed the greatest UNK difference occurring between the UNK and UNK years STOP

START UNK studies indicate that UNK children's interests cover the whole field of science their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and UNK STOP 
START emotional characteristics how a child feels about himself about other people and about the tasks UNK him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics STOP 
START a considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and UNK child is not likely to do well in school subjects STOP 
START emotional maturity is the result of many factors the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life STOP 
START however the teacher who UNK the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction STOP 
START concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in chapter 11 STOP 
START the following UNK about the emotional characteristics of UNK children may be helpful STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START UNK the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time as UNK to those of an adult STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK the child grows older his emotional reactions lead to UNK or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly rather than in short abrupt UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects UNK falling and unexpected movement decline during the UNK years but that fears of the dark of being alone and of imaginary creatures or UNK increase STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem effective solutions include explanations the example of another child or conditioning by UNK the feared object place or person with something pleasant STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START UNK need help in learning to control their emotions STOP 
START the young child UNK from parents and teachers that temper UNK screaming kicking and hitting will not get him what he wants older child UNK that intense emotional UNK will not win approval by his UNK and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START UNK differ widely in their emotional responses STOP 
START among UNK the patterns of emotional responses are similar the influence of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes UNK STOP 
START social characteristics although no national norms exist for the social development of children the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels STOP 
START the following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of UNK children student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of UNK individuals struggling to meet their UNK needs and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the UNK number of groups in which they hold membership STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START UNK early childhood children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children they have been in school a few years their interest in UNK of their own age increases and their interest in adults UNK child who had once considered it a treat to UNK his parents on UNK and family UNK now considers it a bore STOP 
START in late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in and the ideals of right and wrong behavior STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlin early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START -hlin later childhood an interest in team games UNK individual play to the group a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and UNK to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant UNK STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK early childhood boys UNK and UNK on the average more than girls who feel UNK or UNK engage in these activities more than do UNK children STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START UNK late childhood boys like to UNK UNK and talk smart to girls who are more mature than boys UNK upon the youthful UNK of boys of their own age STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START UNK the time pupils reach the sixth grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems but they frequently have vague and UNK notions about the terms they use rather UNK in their routine school work STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START UNK the ages of two and four years UNK or resistance to adult authority is noticeable the fourth year it begins to decline STOP 
START however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the UNK group for those of parents and teachers STOP 
START 8 STOP 
START -hlthe UNK child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups STOP 
START the child in the primary grades can play UNK with one companion but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger wants to be with people but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate STOP 
START in the middle grades however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise STOP 
START why the teacher should study the individual pupil much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program STOP 
START some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom STOP 
START these children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand STOP 
START many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists STOP 
START these specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical services for severely UNK children STOP 
START it is the classroom teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice STOP 
START indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the UNK teacher rather than merely an additional UNK STOP 
START teachers and UNK in many elementary schools have assumed that UNK the pupils in any grade into groups on the basis of test scores UNK the problem of meeting the needs of individuals STOP 
START what they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success and that they still must be treated as individuals STOP 
START although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding differences in ability background and experience STOP 
START factors that UNK learning and lead to UNK studies conducted in various sections of the united states indicate that many children in elementary schools are UNK emotionally and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects STOP 
START one study which involved UNK pupils in grades one to six found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously UNK and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity STOP 
START it is apparent therefore that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children STOP 
START when a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning UNK UNK and other forms of UNK frequently follow STOP 
START these UNK in turn UNK learning and a vicious cycle is completed STOP 
START it is easy for the teacher to UNK that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain UNK or that the child who UNK interest in school who UNK the teacher or who is UNK is a hopeless UNK STOP 
START the causes of UNK and UNK may be found in physical factors such as UNK speech or hearing UNK vision UNK motor coordination a UNK constitution chronic disease UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START they may be caused by poor health habits such as UNK eating and sleeping habits STOP 
START they may be related to mental UNK or lack of UNK for certain types of school work STOP 
START the curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others STOP 
START teaching methods learning materials and promotion policies may UNK learning and lead to UNK for some children STOP 
START UNK family relations broken homes and UNK community influences may also be contributing factors STOP 
START this is only a minimum list of the factors that UNK learning and contribute to UNK among children STOP 
START moreover these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner STOP 
START a vision UNK that may produce nervous tension and reading UNK for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading STOP 
START an UNK home that may UNK one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school STOP 
START at any rate the teacher who UNK common causes of UNK and UNK can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil UNK failure and UNK STOP 
START sources of information about children successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he UNK as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment STOP 
START the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as UNK in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical UNK cannot be expected to UNK all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom STOP 
START he can be expected however to examine and interpret the information already available UNK and extend his own techniques for studying individual children to UNK opportunities arising in connection with regular classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his pupils STOP 
START this section deals with some of the sources of information that can be UNK by the classroom teacher 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in UNK pupil progress STOP 
START cumulative records most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils STOP 
START these records when UNK maintained provide much information about the children which the teacher can use in guidance instruction UNK and reporting to parents STOP 
START each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped with a lock which is used to store cumulative record UNK STOP 
START during summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal STOP 
START only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records STOP 
START each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date STOP 
START some school systems provide written instructions to UNK and teachers UNK when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be UNK and used STOP

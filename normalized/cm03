START this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical or UNK chain or deciding on some action from some already established UNK STOP 
START no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer STOP 
START what gabriel was being asked to do now however was to UNK all his basic assumptions make UNK on them and give them new and different powers in his mind to UNK his motives STOP 
START this is not wholly a reasoning process a computer cannot do it all and even in an angel it takes time STOP 
START or perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago STOP 
START being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long to jack STOP 
START he had already become used to UNK UNK back answers to questions almost before jack could get them asked STOP 
START there was nothing he could do but wait STOP 
START the dice were cast STOP 
START at last gabriel spoke STOP 
START we UNK you he said slowly STOP 
START we had concluded that no race as UNK as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice STOP 
START of course we have before us the example of the great races at the UNK center they are nearly as UNK as you the difference does not seem very marked to us where it exists STOP 
START but they have survived for long periods as races whereas you are young STOP 
START we shall recommend to them that they UNK your trial period by half STOP 
START for now it is clear that we were in the wrong STOP 
START you may UNK your property and the penalty on hesperus is lifted STOP 
START hesperus you may speak STOP 
START i did not perceive this essential distinction either UNK hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal STOP 
START nevertheless you were its agent STOP 
START jack what is the nature of this concept it's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other jack said STOP 
START we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given STOP 
START his heart he discovered was UNK STOP 
START for instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed to take him to earth STOP 
START between individuals this process is called bargaining STOP 
START when it is done between races or nations it is called making a treaty STOP 
START and the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine STOP 
START UNK the property was much less important STOP 
START strange gabriel said STOP 
START and apparently impossible STOP 
START though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us STOP 
START hesperus and UNK jack said show that we do STOP 
START another pause this one was not nearly as long STOP 
START then it is a matter of pleasure curiosity a more alive time STOP 
START yes those could be commodities under this concept STOP 
START but you should understand jack that hesperus and UNK are not long out of the nursery STOP 
START visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older STOP 
START this explained a great deal STOP 
START all the more reason then jack said why we must have a treaty STOP 
START we will UNK entertain your young and give them proper living quarters in return for their help in running our fusion UNK STOP 
START but we must know if this is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they will not UNK the power we put in their hands to our hurt STOP 
START but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the UNK of their own UNK and respect yours in turn STOP 
START to this we of course agree STOP 
START jack felt a wave of complete UNK but in a second it had vanished without a trace STOP 
START what gabriel was asking was that mankind UNK all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws STOP 
START the angels in turn would exercise similar UNK in respect for the natural UNK and UNK of the UNK but they had no UNK notion of man's UNK habit of passing and UNK laws which were contrary to his own UNK and UNK of his nature STOP 
START the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to UNK in short was nothing less than total trust STOP 
START nothing less would serve STOP 
START and it might be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of UNK that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war STOP 
START furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of jack's total UNK could not understand how the principle could ever be UNK STOP 
START almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion not trust as the UNK and UNK attitude toward all UNK STOP 
START yet there was some UNK for it STOP 
START the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been UNK UNK the united states and the union of soviet socialist UNK nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test UNK and a sort of UNK acceptance of each UNK good intentions on this limited question STOP 
START out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world UNK of the united nations between member states still existed but it was of about the same low order of UNK as the UNK UNK between UNK and california over water supplies STOP 
START besides agreements in principle with the UNK details to be UNK out later were commonplace in diplomatic history STOP 
START the trouble with them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled STOP 
START suppose that this one were to work was no question in jack's mind of the good faith on one side at least STOP 
START if mankind could be convinced of that it was worth trying STOP 
START in fact it had to be tried STOP 
START it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed STOP 
START secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to be content with small UNK in all diplomatic matters there was no small way to handle this one STOP 
START he turned back to the UNK the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips STOP 
START but he was too late STOP 
START he had lost his audience STOP 
START for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw STOP 
START it seemed to be only a UNK of color light and meaningless activity STOP 
START gradually he realized that the pentagon of angel UNK had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up STOP 
START the angels in the nursery were UNK wildly in all directions seemingly at random STOP 
START hesperus going on here happened your brothers have been found STOP 
START they are on their way here STOP 
START where don't see them STOP 
START the instruments don't show them STOP 
START you can't see them yet jack STOP 
START they'll be in range in a short while STOP 
START jack UNK the skies the boards and the skies again STOP 
START nothing STOP 
START no there was a tiny pip on the radar it was getting bigger rapidly STOP 
START if that was the UNK it was making unprecedented speed STOP 
START then the UNK UNK into sight just a dot of light at first against the UNK UNK and UNK UNK of the coal UNK STOP 
START through the UNK jack could see that both UNK were still attached to it STOP 
START the sail was still UNK though there were a good many holes in it as UNK had predicted would be the case by now STOP 
START it was a startling almost UNK sight even more UNK was the fact that it was UNK an enormous UNK of angels STOP 
START the UNK was not heading for the nursery however STOP 
START it seemed unlikely that her crew if either of them were alive could even see the UNK for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a UNK STOP 
START and there would be no chance of UNK them without the UNK generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could UNK his fusion power the UNK would be gone STOP 
START UNK helpless he watched them pass him STOP 
START the sail UNK though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars STOP 
START he would never have believed without seeing it that the UNK little vessel could go so fast STOP 
START but where was it going why was it causing so much UNK among the angels and being followed by so many of them was only one possible answer but jack's UNK mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar UNK of the UNK course into the computer STOP 
START the curve on the card the computer UNK back at him couldn't be argued with however STOP 
START the UNK was headed for the very center of the UNK toward that place which jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the UNK life and religion STOP 
START it was clear that UNK had at last found a way to attract the UNK attention STOP 
START it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off STOP 
START stern chase 10 UNK would have to be headed off whether he knew where he was going or not STOP 
START almost surely he did all he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from and he was an almost UNK UNK man STOP 
START but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line STOP 
START had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud was a center of government instead of a center of life and faith it didn't matter now whether he meant to UNK the holy of UNK or was simply headed in that direction by accident STOP 
START if it was UNK it was now also unnecessary whether UNK or not the outcome would be disastrous STOP 
START jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had UNK from the UNK generator switch STOP 
START when he was back on his feet again and about to UNK the UNK however he hesitated STOP 
START he had to have fusion power to catch up with the UNK and he had to have it fast STOP 
START but fusion power in the coal UNK was what had UNK all the trouble in the first place and he already had an angel aboard STOP 
START hesperus receiving STOP 
START i'm going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do STOP 
START but i can't take you to earth yet STOP 
START first i've got to UNK my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble STOP 
START will you UNK this or will you help know it's not part of the UNK and your UNK might not like it STOP 
START nobody else can live in your UNK while i am in it hesperus said promptly STOP 
START as for my UNK they have already admitted that they were wrong STOP 
START if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted to go there at all STOP 
START therefore of course i will help STOP 
START with a UNK sigh of relief jack UNK the UNK back in and threw the switch STOP 
START without an UNK transition the green light that meant full fusion power UNK on the board STOP 
START always before it had taken five minutes to of course STOP 
START hesperus was in there STOP 
START from here on out the UNK was going to be UNK than any space UNK man had ever dreamed of STOP 
START but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in UNK an UNK orbit STOP 
START hesperus don't use this UNK vector trick of yours please STOP

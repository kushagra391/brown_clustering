START from time to time the medium UNK other people around him who were on the other side and reports what they are saying STOP 
START after a while there come UNK and names and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family UNK STOP 
START as the hour UNK the sensitive seems to UNK more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements STOP 
START there are a few UNK of coming events STOP 
START another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different content but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading STOP 
START some UNK speak in practical UNK terms while others may stress the spiritual STOP 
START not all as a matter of fact consider themselves UNK in the sense of receiving messages from the UNK STOP 
START in fact some UNK rule this out UNK to consider their expression as strictly UNK perception UNK on this side of the UNK STOP 
START however that may be people are known to go to UNK for diverse reasons STOP 
START perhaps they are UNK a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the UNK or seek indications for future plans STOP 
START they may of course be curiosity UNK or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of UNK STOP 
START the UNK with whom the UNK foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly UNK state so that the sitter can make comments ask and answer questions instead of talking with a control who speaks through an UNK sensitive STOP 
START what we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation STOP 
START but it is not really only a conversation STOP 
START many a sitter in a personal sitting has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very UNK his state of mind STOP 
START he himself might not have been really aware of his own mood had been UNK UNK UNK and only partly realized until she described it to him striking indeed is this UNK ability to put a finger on UNK UNK and to clarify them STOP 
START however in the next visit that the UNK made to the medium he did not receive a personal reading STOP 
START instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing STOP 
START for this was to be a UNK sitting STOP 
START as was noted earlier it is important that in valid objective study of this sort of communication the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive STOP 
START dr. UNK UNK director of research at the UNK foundation described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article new research on survival after death spring 1958 STOP 
START he remarked it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received UNK by the medium from the sitter STOP 
START the possibility has to be ruled out that the UNK UNK may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central characters in this drama must be separated STOP 
START one way to do this is by UNK UNK UNK the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute the UNK sitter STOP 
START if the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name given by the UNK he cannot possibly give any UNK conscious or unconscious far less ask leading questions STOP 
START all he can do is to be an objective and careful UNK seeking to help the sensitive in UNK and making more specific her UNK impressions STOP 
START sometimes in these experiments appointment UNK are used STOP 
START here the absent sitter makes a date with a UNK someone close to him who is UNK asking him to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for him STOP 
START in this case the UNK sitter will know only the name of the UNK nothing else STOP 
START he gives this to the medium at the appointed time and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the UNK STOP 
START as always a tape recording or detailed notes are made and a UNK of this is sent to the absent sitter STOP 
START so this UNK situation has set up at least a partial UNK between the UNK UNK and the absent UNK mind STOP 
START it is now harder to assume UNK as a basis for the statements though research still does not know how far UNK UNK can range STOP 
START now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him STOP 
START here again laboratory approaches are being UNK for it is recognized how UNK these readings can be how they can apply to many people and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case STOP 
START if you look at a reading meant for someone else you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you even when you were not in the picture at all interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a hit describing something accurately for him but can he really be sure that another sitter hearing the same statement would not apply it UNK to his own circumstances is of course easy to see how UNK will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another STOP 
START a journey a little white house a change of outlook can apply to many people STOP 
START and even more complex items can be interpreted to UNK to one's own point of view which is by nature so personal STOP 
START one sitter may think a leather couch UNK a reading as surely directed to him another it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase UNK boy get around this quite difficult corner there is one first aid to UNK prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him STOP 
START if he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him he can more readily UNK each item in a larger frame does that statement really sound as if it were for me significant in my particular life am i taking something that could really apply to almost anybody and UNK that many other people probably have had a similar experience UNK would consider as impressive such statements as the following which if they turned out to be hits are so unusual as to be really significant he had four children two sets of twins STOP 
START after being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry STOP 
START part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road STOP 
START he died of UNK in UNK STOP 
START methods have been developed of UNK weights to statements is it is known UNK that names beginning with r are more common than those beginning with UNK fewer women are named UNK than elizabeth in the united states more people die of heart disease than of UNK STOP 
START so each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights STOP 
START specific dates would be important as would double names STOP 
START various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical probabilities against which to measure the readings STOP 
START in the UNK foundation's long-range experiment readings are made by a variety of UNK for a large number of UNK UNK trying to throw light on this question of the significance of UNK statements STOP 
START it is very important indeed in the field of UNK perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis to know whether the statements are actually only those which any UNK person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself STOP 
START or on the other hand are unlikely facts being stated facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody is one thing the experiments are designed to find out STOP 
START so after the sitting has been held several readings at one time are mailed and the distant sitter whose name or whose UNK name was given to the medium must mark each little item as correct hit UNK miss doubtful or especially significant applying to him and he feels not to anyone else STOP 
START he is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his STOP 
START all these UNK are then UNK up and UNK by adding up the hits and UNK with the weight placed on those in the UNK own reading STOP 
START that is if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him the total experimental score falls STOP 
START UNK if he gives a heavy UNK to his own reading and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others a point is UNK up for the UNK objective UNK of this type of UNK material STOP 
START and there are some positive results though the final findings will not be known for a long time and then further research can be formulated STOP 
START in another approach to the same procedure the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to UNK her statements STOP 
START does she often speak of locations of cause of death she accurately give dates ages kind of occupation is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall and where she makes most of her hits STOP 
START now when so to speak the cream has been UNK off and the items in the successful categories separated out the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream where the sensitive is at her best STOP 
START UNK impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses STOP 
START i feel cold the medium says or my leg UNK my head is heavy STOP 
START or perhaps she UNK words or sounds there's such a noise of loud machinery or i hear a child crying or he says we're all here and glad to see you STOP 
START maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness with action and motion or a static view a house under a pine tree with a little stone path going up to the door STOP 
START the sensitive often seems to smell definite UNK too or UNK feels emotions STOP 
START sometimes she displays amazing UNK UNK and seems to see all details in perspective as if the scene were actually there STOP 
START if pressed by the sitter for more detail she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost as if she were physically going closer STOP 
START if asked how she gets her impressions she probably can only say that she just gets them some more UNK than others STOP 
START perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all STOP 
START even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how of atmosphere of one UNK personalities UNK intentions STOP 
START of course there is an element of training here these gifted people by concentration study guidance have learned to develop their power STOP 
START simply using it increases its intensity i was told by one sensitive STOP 
START nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her UNK STOP 
START impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value STOP 
START it is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious and the medium has to translate these into meaning STOP 
START if communication with an UNK on the other side is taking place this too may assume the form of UNK UNK STOP 
START during one reading an image appeared of a UNK in UNK STOP 
START but this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual UNK STOP 
START in this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained STOP 
START though they are often heard UNK as if a voice were speaking them in other cases they are UNK UNK as symbols a slope to UNK the name hill for instance STOP 
START one medium saw two sheets UNK on a line and found that the name UNK was significant to the sitter STOP

START must berlin remain divided UNK has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building UNK across berlin the free world must UNK in UNK of that living city STOP 
START so far as the record is concerned the western powers have not UNK and should not do so STOP 
START though walter UNK by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east germany that does not give him any right to UNK the government of east berlin or to absorb that UNK into the soviet zone STOP 
START the UNK UNK of september 12 1944 designated a special greater berlin area UNK the entire city to be under joint occupation STOP 
START it was not a part of any one of the three later four UNK for occupation by soviet american british and french troops respectively STOP 
START after the berlin blockade and UNK the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to UNK the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin STOP 
START for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by UNK separately the laws for the two areas STOP 
START then they moved offices of the east german UNK government into east berlin and began UNK to treat it as the capital of east germany STOP 
START that this and the closing of the east UNK berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain france and the united states sent to moscow after the UNK UNK protest over a visit of chancellor UNK and other west german officials to west berlin STOP 
START the chancellor had as much business there as UNK had in east berlin and was certainly less UNK than the juvenile UNK UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START the british and other UNK to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities to UNK east berlin into east germany by UNK it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany STOP 
START they insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin has a UNK status STOP 
START this is far from UNK or UNK those efforts as an accomplished fact STOP 
START there remains of course the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the UNK efforts from becoming accomplished facts STOP 
START one ground of action certainly exists when UNK of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist UNK try to gun down UNK UNK residents STOP 
START another remained when an american army car was UNK but with a broken glass STOP 
START the glass may seem trivial but communist official UNK feeds on such incidents unless they are UNK STOP 
START remembering the UNK fate of UNK and the west german UNK about UNK tactics it is to be hoped that the UNK of general clay to west berlin as president kennedy's representative will mark a UNK of response not only to future UNK and UNK but also to some that have passed STOP 
START prairie national park thousands of buffalo UNK they will never be to the man on the street UNK like a mobile brown UNK upon the rolling UNK UNK STOP 
START a horizon even and UNK binding the vast UNK dome of sky to earth STOP 
START that picture of the american prairie is as UNK fixed in the memory of those who have studied the UNK of the american continent as any later UNK image of the west made in UNK UNK near hollywood STOP 
START for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless UNK of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the UNK supply that was to take many of them UNK when the ohio and mississippi UNK began to fill STOP 
START the national park service now UNK to preserve an area in UNK county northeast kansas as a prairie national park STOP 
START there the buffalo would UNK to be seen as a UNK not as UNK UNK specimens STOP 
START UNK stream UNK in the UNK of earth would be saved STOP 
START UNK would extend UNK UNK UNK by UNK or barn as the first settlers saw them STOP 
START the park service makes an impressive UNK and statistical case for creating this new park STOP 
START american history should UNK the case when congress is asked to approve STOP 
START whisky on the air a philadelphia UNK is currently UNK the customary prohibition against UNK advertising on tv and radio STOP 
START starting with small stations not members of the national association of UNK the firm apparently is seeking to break down the UNK barriers in UNK stations STOP 
START probably the best answer to this kind of entering UNK is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to UNK such advertising through its UNK power STOP 
START the national association of UNK code specifically bars UNK UNK STOP 
START past UNK of public opinion show popular favor for this policy STOP 
START even the UNK spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition STOP 
START why then with these voluntary UNK and some state laws UNK liquor UNK is it necessary to seek congressional action because the UNK action of firms that are not members of the UNK spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the UNK tends to spread STOP 
START soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to UNK their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer UNK from the efforts of UNK UNK STOP 
START although the false UNK surrounding UNK or other whisky UNK is possibly no more UNK than the UNK with which tv UNK are UNK or UNK applied there is a sad difference between UNK a UNK into UNK UNK and UNK him into UNK UNK STOP 
START a law is needed STOP 
START new york UNK choice registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to UNK their UNK candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization STOP 
START in the central contest that for mayor they may have found some pertinent points in what each UNK has said about the other STOP 
START mayor robert f. wagner must as his opponents demand assume responsibility for his performance in office STOP 
START while all citizens share in blame for UNK municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies STOP 
START the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record STOP 
START state UNK arthur UNK on the other hand cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown UNK interest in political power than in the city's welfare STOP 
START they too have UNK with the city's UNK STOP 
START both men are known to be honest and UNK STOP 
START mayor UNK UNK have perhaps been more UNK exposed than those of mr. UNK who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post STOP 
START as mayor mr. UNK might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading UNK would like STOP 
START his election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the UNK STOP 
START mr. wagner might or might not be a new mayor in this third term now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls UNK STOP 
START these are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote STOP 
START but his UNK would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him STOP 
START if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish it nevertheless must be made STOP 
START the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party STOP 
START little war big test both mr. UNK have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos STOP 
START president kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused thursday to be drawn into UNK a public UNK to moscow STOP 
START but at the same time he moved his UNK marines to within an hour of the fighting STOP 
START and secretary UNK UNK route to UNK doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of UNK or UNK UNK forces STOP 
START for mr. kennedy speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation STOP 
START the new president is in no position to start out his UNK with moscow by UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says STOP 
START in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr. khrushchev for the third time STOP 
START at his press conference mr. kennedy said all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war UNK STOP 
START at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in UNK but ready position STOP 
START since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this approach might be expected to head off mr. khrushchev for the moment STOP 
START but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would UNK washington in a UNK mess STOP 
START as wars go laos is an extremely little one STOP 
START UNK have been running about a dozen men a day STOP 
START the hard core of the UNK rebel force numbers only some UNK tough viet UNK guerrilla fighters STOP 
START but for the united states and its UNK allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less UNK government army in UNK UNK UNK UNK is a risk not UNK by pentagon planners STOP 
START but if anything can bring home to mr. khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this UNK contest it will probably be the fact that UNK forces are ready to attempt it plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington STOP 
START fortunately both the republicans and america's chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president STOP 
START actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table STOP 
START it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it UNK as UNK STOP 
START the state department UNK rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 and last year washington backed the UNK UNK that UNK neutral premier UNK UNK STOP 
START but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a UNK position and now is ready to back the british plan for a UNK UNK by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers STOP 
START the road to a UNK UNK laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's UNK STOP 
START but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the UNK people who would not be UNK by either UNK minority now engaged in the fighting this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made STOP 
START the world UNK mr. khrushchev's choice of alternatives STOP 
START a vote for educational tv the UNK overwhelming UNK vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be UNK in the lower house STOP 
START twice previously the senate has approved measures UNK UNK and the house has let them die STOP 
START but this year prospects may be better STOP 
START the house communications UNK is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds STOP 
START this year's senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with UNK to be used in support of private state or municipal UNK efforts STOP 
START the funds would be used for equipment not for land buildings or operation STOP 
START the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value STOP 
START but lacking money from commercial UNK the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service STOP 
START other communities the ones to be aided most by the senate bill have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment STOP

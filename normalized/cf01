START in american romance almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called meeting UNK that is UNK seems more UNK if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom STOP 
START just about the most UNK UNK example of meeting UNK is the charles UNK UNK UNK UNK all he did was give her a handful of UNK but he said simultaneously i wish they were UNK STOP 
START aside from the UNK content here a good UNK could readily pick up a few other facts especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on STOP 
START the way UNK said his line if you had the recorded UNK of a professional linguist would probably have gone like this af primary stresses on UNK and wish pitch 3 pretty high on UNK but with a slight degree of UNK one degree of UNK STOP 
START conclusions the people involved and subsequent facts bear me out here knew clearly the relative values of UNK and UNK both UNK and sentimental STOP 
START and the UNK UNK voice of UNK though fairly overt was still well within the prescribed UNK of their culture STOP 
START in other words like UNK machines designed to work in UNK they shared the same UNK a mutual understanding not only of english words but of the four stresses UNK and UNK that can change their meaning from black to white STOP 
START at this point unfortunately romance becomes a UNK small part of the picture consider if you can bear it what might have happened if UNK for some UNK UNK reason had made the same remark to an UNK girl in UNK STOP 
START to her UNK and UNK would have been just so much UNK STOP 
START the point quite simply is this words they might have had communication no STOP 
START this basic principle the first in a UNK UNK bundle was UNK to me by dr. henry lee smith jr. at the university of buffalo where he heads the world's first department of UNK and UNK STOP 
START a UNK amusing man apparently constructed on an UNK system of UNK UNK to the same UNK rhythm as his mind smith began his academic career teaching speech to UNK girls a project considerably UNK by his devotion to a recording about a young UNK named arthur who never could make up his mind STOP 
START later he became one of the central spirits of the army language program and the language school of UNK foreign service institute STOP 
START it was there in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts that he first began to develop a system of UNK the norms of human communication STOP 
START to the trained ear of the linguist talk has always revealed a UNK quantity of information about the UNK such things as geographical origin and history UNK identity education STOP 
START it is only fairly recently however that linguists have developed a systematic way of UNK voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people STOP 
START this for obvious reasons makes their techniques UNK useful in studying the UNK interview so useful in fact that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy STOP 
START in the early UNK smith together with his distinguished UNK george UNK so UNK academic he sometimes UNK his own evident charm and a third man with the UNK name of UNK ray agreed on some basic UNK about the UNK process that makes communication 1 words or language 2 UNK a set of phenomena including laughing UNK voice breaks and tone of voice and 3 UNK the technical name for UNK UNK expressions and body shifts UNK or shaking the head talking with one's hands et UNK STOP 
START UNK first UNK with stresses UNK and UNK was based on mother which UNK in our culture a good deal more than bread alone STOP 
START for example if you are a reasonably UNK person there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for UNK your mother STOP 
START the usual u.s. UNK would be af middle UNK slight pause UNK before mother slight rise at the end STOP 
START the symbols of mother's status here are all usual for culture UNK STOP 
START quite other feelings are evidenced by this style af note the drop to pitch 1 the lowest on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence is a UNK ending and what you have here is a UNK style of speech expressing something less than conventional respect for mother STOP 
START even less regard for UNK and UNK UNK pie goes with af in other words the way the speaker UNK to mother is clearly indicated STOP 
START and while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely UNK STOP 
START an accompanying record of UNK factors for the second example might also note a UNK UNK STOP 
START with this UNK sentence though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food he was telling things about himself and in the last two examples revealing that he had UNK from the customs of his culture STOP 
START the joint investigations of UNK and UNK have established in point of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they UNK to the rest of the world STOP 
START since UNK is the basic therapeutic and UNK instrument of modern UNK the recording of interviews for UNK and study has been a boost of UNK proportions in new research and training STOP 
START some of the earliest UNK made in the UNK demonstrated that UNK reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer UNK to therapy which if they were at all UNK in print were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts STOP 
START in a general way UNK were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt that the most telling UNK in UNK are UNK that such things as stress and UNK are UNK by sound alone and not necessarily by words STOP 
START at a minimum recording usually on tape which is now in wide professional use brings the UNK interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of UNK STOP 
START newest to this UNK battery are the experts in UNK who have carried that minimum to a new level STOP 
START by adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the UNK UNK of interviews they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist STOP 
START UNK UNK of the UNK interview UNK points where the patient's voice UNK from expected norms STOP 
START it UNK such possible UNK of communication as UNK dialogue the note of disapproval UNK or ambiguity UNK resentment and the UNK to speak at all this last often marked by a UNK beginning of sentences STOP 
START interpretation naturally remains the role of the therapist but orientation not only the patient's vocal UNK of geographical and UNK background but also vocal but UNK UNK of danger spots in his relationship to people can be considerably UNK up by the linguist STOP 
START his UNK UNK of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper UNK may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient STOP 
START in one UNK first interview for example the UNK UNK from the book the first five minutes goes like this the UNK level tone is UNK and neutral he has for example avoided UNK you which would imply disapproval surprise which would set the patient apart from other people STOP 
START the patient on the other hand is far from neutral from her specifically regional UNK she reveals by the use of the UNK UNK tense depressed a certain UNK UNK that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language i.e. she must have had at least a UNK education and she is telling a story she has mentally UNK some time before STOP 
START then she UNK into everything and everybody putting particular violence on everybody indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag that is it is not UNK to the patient's general style of speech up to this point STOP 
START consequently it is referred to the therapist for attention STOP 
START he may then very well conclude that everybody is probably not the true target of her resentment STOP 
START immediately thereafter the patient UNK her UNK story UNK into an UNK UNK UNK UNK i don't feel like talking right now STOP 
START within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that everybody UNK refers to the woman's husband STOP 
START she says later but still within the opening five minutes i keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death STOP 
START the UNK and UNK signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence are certain signals that she does not accept divorce STOP 
START by saying another emotional death she reveals that there has been a previous one although she has not described it in words STOP 
START this the therapist may pursue in later questioning STOP 
START the phrase emotional death interesting and to a UNK mind rather touching suggests that this woman may have some UNK for words perhaps even something of the UNK UNK called creative STOP 
START since the UNK interview like any other interview depends on communication it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience STOP 
START his own communication apparatus operated UNK and UNK ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the UNK UNK UNK mechanism of dr. UNK STOP 
START UNK enough although none of the UNK UNK involved could UNK compare with UNK when groups of them began playing back interviews they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques everyone on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again STOP 
START yet in spite of this intensive study of the UNK interviews by teams of UNK and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that in the first five minutes of an initial interview the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him spot these UNK the therapist must know either UNK or UNK how to listen STOP 
START naturally the patient does not say i hate my father or UNK UNK is what UNK me STOP 
START what he does do is give himself away by UNK information over and above the words involved STOP 
START some of the classic UNK as described by UNK UNK UNK and UNK in the first five minutes are these ambiguity of UNK UNK or repetition of i you he she et UNK may signal ambiguity or uncertainty STOP 
START on the other hand significant facts may be UNK she may mean i or everybody as it did with the tense and UNK woman mentioned before may refer to a specific person STOP 
START the word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used and linguist must always consider the alternatives STOP 
START when someone says for example they took UNK to see that there was nothing wrong with me it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made STOP 
START this patient in UNK was a UNK who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her UNK but her UNK that was the cause of her difficulty STOP 
START amateur linguists note here that UNK in UNK UNK UNK UNK when he spoke of his wife which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship STOP

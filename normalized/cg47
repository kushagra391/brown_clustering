START i stood on a table surrounded by hundreds of UNK young faces STOP 
START questions came to me from all sides about my world UNK activities STOP 
START after making a short statement about human rights and the freedom to travel i told them i would be going to the kehl bridge the next morning in order to cross the UNK into germany STOP 
START may we come with you out a dozen young voices STOP 
START well i might not get that far i told them as actually i have no papers to enter germany and as a matter of fact no permit to return to france once i leave STOP 
START that was all they needed STOP 
START they would champion me STOP 
START we would all meet at ten o'clock at the kehl bridge five miles from UNK and march UNK across into germany STOP 
START there was only one UNK the small town of kehl on the other side of the UNK was still under french jurisdiction STOP 
START the real UNK frontier was beyond the town's limits STOP 
START in fact all persons were permitted to cross the UNK into kehl there being no UNK posted on the west side of the river STOP 
START that evening as i learned later the students enjoying that spontaneous UNK in action known only to university students UNK out onto the streets of UNK UNK empty UNK marking up store UNK and shouting UNK garry davis to power i got off the UNK at kehl bridge the next morning i was met by what looked like UNK students some of whom were carrying sticks apparently for the coming battle with the police STOP 
START UNK by this display of weapons i looked toward the bridge and there saw stretched across the near side a UNK of policemen their UNK forming a UNK before which stood several french officers in uniform and a small UNK man in a brown UNK STOP 
START listen please i called to the students in french STOP 
START i thank you most UNK for being here STOP 
START this is full evidence of your support for my principles STOP 
START these principles however will not be served by violence in any form STOP 
START if they are right they will UNK of and by themselves STOP 
START i ask you all to support me in this STOP 
START if one finger is raised against the authorities all our moral power will UNK STOP 
START your UNK in this respect will be the only witness to your understanding of what i am saying STOP 
START i have full confidence in you STOP 
START now let's go STOP 
START i UNK up to the waiting officials the students UNK behind me STOP 
START as usual the press UNK were on hand STOP 
START the UNK man stopped me three UNK from the UNK UNK and asked me in french if i had papers to leave france STOP 
START i replied in the UNK taking out my recently acquired UNK UNK et de voyage on which was UNK a permission to leave france STOP 
START he examined it carefully handed it back and said UNK UNK you may leave france STOP 
START i took one step UNK STOP 
START one of the UNK officers stepped in my way demanding to know whether i had permission to enter germany STOP 
START no i have no permission to enter germany i told him STOP 
START UNK you may go no farther he said UNK STOP 
START is this then the frontier asked him STOP 
START yes STOP 
START at this the students let out a UNK knowing full well the actual frontier was beyond the town of kehl STOP 
START but i have no permission to UNK france and i have just left i told him STOP 
START i must then be standing on the line between france and germany STOP 
START the UNK man stepped forward STOP 
START line there is no line between france and germany that is no actual line STOP 
START i mean no line asked STOP 
START but if there is no line how can there be two countries have just given me permission to leave france which i did STOP 
START i have witnesses STOP 
START and as you know i have no permission to UNK france once out STOP 
START now i learn i cannot enter germany STOP 
START obviously i'm stuck on the line between the two countries STOP 
START the students were laughing UNK at this piece of logic and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile STOP 
START UNK UNK the interior ministry man UNK you may come back to UNK now if you wish STOP 
START oh will you give me a UNK to UNK france UNK there is no question of a UNK STOP 
START you are still in france STOP 
START ah then please tell me where the frontier is because this gentleman here i indicated the french occupation officer UNK me that germany is just on the other side of him STOP 
START the interior man looked UNK at his french UNK STOP 
START from the crowd were coming UNK of he's right there must be a line UNK garry continue their UNK i said well until i have permission to enter germany or a UNK to UNK france i shall be obliged to remain here on the line between two countries UNK i moved to the side of the road parked my UNK against the small UNK on the sidewalk sat down took out my UNK and began UNK the above conversation STOP 
START the reporters were questioning the interior man and the french officer both of whom remained UNK as to what action if any would be taken in my regard STOP 
START finally they went off to file their stories after the UNK had taken pictures of my latest UNK STOP 
START the students crowded around asking questions UNK me on the back and generally being friendly STOP 
START but what will you do this evening mr. davis a young UNK UNK STOP 
START it will be very cold STOP

START i shall see about getting you a tent he said STOP

START that would be a great help i told him UNK him for his UNK STOP 
START a special guard was posted at my end of the bridge to make sure i didn't cross the UNK of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else men women and children dogs cats horses cars trucks baby UNK could cross kehl bridge into kehl without UNK STOP 
START the day passed UNK enough with a constant stream of visitors some stopping only to say UNK others getting into serious UNK such as one UNK UNK a UNK UNK from UNK who wrote an article for the UNK UNK in highly sympathetic terms STOP 
START some students from the university returned around six with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week STOP 
START a UNK food UNK had been arranged they told me which would supply me with the necessities as long as i remained at the bridge STOP 
START a little later the sports shop man returned with a small UNK tent STOP 
START one of the girl students sitting by while i ate the thick soup asked me if i had a sleeping bag STOP 
START when i informed her that i didn't she said she would UNK her UNK and bring it to me later that evening STOP 
START you do not know me she said in good english but my mother was your UNK in philadelphia when you were a child STOP

START the peter family proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days mrs. peter little UNK and UNK who UNK UNK me his sleeping bag for my watch on the UNK STOP 
START UNK a line from the bridge to a small field directly to the side i UNK the tent that evening on the UNK line UNK a small UNK around it as best i could with a UNK UNK UNK by a neighborhood child STOP 
START the wind from the UNK was damp and chill UNK a fire for warmth STOP 
START after UNK around a bit in the open area i came across what proved to be UNK UNK which UNK and burned UNK giving off vast rolls of smoke into the UNK sky STOP

START i had advised friends to write me to no man's land pont kehl between UNK and kehl UNK STOP 
START sure enough mail began UNK in delivered by a UNK highly UNK french UNK who informed me there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that address would be recognized STOP 
START on christmas eve students brought out two small christmas trees which i placed on either side of the tent STOP 
START as the field on which my tent was UNK was a favorite natural UNK for the kids of the neighborhood i had made many friends among them taking part in their UNK games and trying desperately to translate UNK UNK tales into an understandable french as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent STOP 
START to my great surprise and delight when they saw the two trees they went UNK off returning shortly with UNK from their own trees STOP 
START it was a UNK if somewhat UNK christmas for me that year STOP

START the special guard however was still posted on kehl bridge STOP 
START as it began UNK at around eight o'clock on december UNK i retired into my tent early somewhat tired and discouraged my body UNK UNK because of the continued exposure STOP 
START no matter how large the fire i couldn't seem to shake off the chill that day STOP

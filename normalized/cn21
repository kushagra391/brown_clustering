START UNK oil and UNK make the kind of UNK any UNK dreams of STOP 
START i suppose a UNK UNK had UNK a cigarette in the hold and touched off the UNK STOP 
START now UNK up in great UNK clouds of smoke and flames the UNK heat quickly drove us to the stern where we UNK like UNK sheep not knowing what to do STOP 
START the UNK were stuck fast STOP 
START we couldn't UNK them STOP 
START i heard a cry from a UNK as a UNK of flame leaped from a UNK and UNK the man's bare back STOP 
START he UNK to the rail and leaped UNK into the UNK waters STOP 
START one especially bad UNK shook UNK no. 3 which UNK violently in the UNK STOP 
START brassnose yelled come on UNK max step on it we got a chance now STOP 
START UNK on those UNK UNK come UNK STOP 
START we pulled and swore and UNK and UNK UNK our hands until they UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK was UNK and UNK like an old UNK mare STOP 
START her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the UNK which dropped heavily into the water STOP 
START brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and UNK to the boat STOP 
START let's get away fast said brassnose shaking water from his UNK of UNK hair STOP 
START that tub is going to UNK all at once STOP 
START then the UNK seemed to UNK with a roar of live steam UNK of UNK and flames and a UNK cloud of UNK smoke STOP 
START dimly we heard the voices of men in UNK UNK but we couldn't go back into that UNK STOP 
START already our UNK UNK was filled with five inches of water STOP 
START UNK you UNK while we row brassnose commanded STOP 
START as best as i could determine we were some UNK miles west of new UNK in the UNK UNK STOP 
START three days previously we had UNK past UNK UNK island in the distance STOP 
START now we peered UNK for any UNK of land in the pacific for this UNK UNK would have to stop soon STOP 
START there were UNK UNK and rope burns on our hands muscles were hot wires of pain STOP 
START brassnose was UNK silent STOP 
START the big man with the UNK hair murmured something his words sounded as if they were in the UNK tongue which i recognized having studied the UNK in my UNK 6 class at the university of chicago STOP 
START he then said something which struck a UNK in my memory STOP 
START god help us if we're near the island of UNK STOP 
START we'd be in real trouble then STOP 
START i'd rather keep UNK or sink STOP 
START i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled the voice of mild professor howard UNK three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies STOP 
START he had been speaking of this UNK even when the islands were under german UNK before world war 1 UNK gave UNK a wide UNK STOP 
START the place is UNK by several hundred UNK women who are UNK of the twentieth century stone age UNK who live in an UNK UNK society which is UNK STOP 
START i remembered too the UNK voice of a UNK bobby UNK but how do they UNK dr. UNK sure that males have something to do with that process had been classroom UNK which quickly UNK as professor UNK said UNK i see your point UNK STOP 
START of course males play a role there but believe me when i say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on UNK STOP 
START indeed you wouldn't live long for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after UNK them for UNK purposes or they destroy them by UNK but UNK methods STOP 
START in fact one important aspect of their very religion is the UNK of men STOP 
START i think i know what you mean brassnose i said STOP 
START i know something about UNK STOP 
START let's hope we come to a UNK place STOP 
START but we didn't STOP 
START three hours later while we were UNK desperately a dot of land came into view STOP 
START foster UNK UNK made a sign over his heart with his two linked UNK i recognized it as an ancient UNK gesture intended to UNK the devil STOP 
START a UNK passed had UNK closer STOP 
START in a voice so frightened as to seem not his own the big UNK mate UNK UNK is UNK look hard you can see with your naked eye the wooden UNK on the cliff STOP 
START i UNK at the UNK UNK STOP 
START there was a wooden tower or UNK there something like a UNK jump was perhaps 80 feet high and had been UNK constructed of UNK STOP 
START a fine example of engineering in a primitive society STOP 
START what is the UNK for brassnose made a sound of despair deep in his throat STOP 
START it was embarrassing to see UNK blonde brassnose UNK himself like a child who talks about UNK STOP 
START UNK is their UNK the UNK platform of death STOP 
START it is the last of the three tests of UNK which the women UNK to discover if a male is worthy of survival there STOP 
START often i heard my UNK and UNK speak of it when i was a small boy growing up in UNK STOP 
START they had never seen a UNK but they had heard about it from their fathers STOP 
START our UNK was filling rapidly and despite what i had heard of the inhabitants of UNK i was glad to see a long and UNK UNK manned by three UNK girls UNK out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft STOP 
START i expected brassnose as a man with a strain of UNK in his blood to speak to them STOP 
START but he had turned a UNK green and appeared UNK or UNK STOP 
START so i UNK my few words of the UNK UNK and said we UNK you in peace STOP 
START in UNK STOP 
START my friends and i come from a ship which was destroyed by fire STOP 
START we are UNK and hungry UNK and burned hands and arms need attention STOP 
START the girl in the UNK of the UNK turned a smile like a UNK on me STOP 
START i noted that her full UNK were bare and that she wore a UNK of red UNK fruit in her UNK hair STOP 
START she said my name is UNK and these girls are UNK and UNK STOP 
START you are welcome to UNK STOP 
START my people UNK you on the shore STOP 
START you shall have food water and rest STOP 
START thirty minutes later the UNK UNK on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with UNK UNK to a large UNK STOP 
START i saw a dozen or so other UNK UNK there STOP 
START i looked STOP 
START all my UNK UNK of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight STOP 
START there was a mound of UNK human bones and UNK at the base of the big wooden UNK STOP 
START some had been there for years still had UNK UNK of UNK flesh UNK to them STOP 
START there was one object which UNK yet UNK me STOP 
START this was also a UNK a male judging from the UNK arm bands the UNK UNK still UNK on the UNK face the painted bone of the UNK UNK which still UNK the UNK of the UNK nose STOP 
START the body may have been two or three UNK dead STOP 
START i looked with UNK at the legs STOP 
START they were shattered STOP 
START many small bones UNK UNK from the UNK of flesh STOP 
START the man must have leaped to his death from the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP 
START as if UNK my thoughts the girl UNK smiled UNK and said in the casual tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden this is our UNK a UNK platform UNK STOP 
START later you shall know it better STOP 
START is it not UNK old one blew down in a storm at the time of the UNK festival fifteen UNK ago STOP 
START it took thirty of our women almost six UNK to build this one which is higher and stronger than the old one STOP 
START we are very proud of it STOP 
START you have every right to be i replied UNK in the UNK UNK but my attention was fixed on brassnose the biggest and strongest of us STOP 
START he looked as if he was going to UNK over STOP 
START i felt a UNK in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid STOP 
START not so soon anyway STOP 
START i UNK the big man with the UNK hair on his shoulder and said UNK hoping it would make an impression on the women this one is the UNK UNK STOP 
START he speaks your language too for he is the UNK of a UNK on UNK who made much magic and was strong and UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK has inherited this strength from his grandfather STOP 
START this was the worst thing i could have said STOP 
START brassnose turned a UNK face toward me and said UNK UNK you UNK UNK you're a fool UNK males who UNK of their strength destroy such men with their damned tests STOP 
START you've ruined me blast you first i thought he was out of his head talking wildly like this STOP 
START but a glance at UNK and the other women confirmed what brassnose had UNK out STOP 
START the women's faces had hardened after my statement STOP 
START at a nod from UNK four UNK and muscular girls UNK to UNK side and seized him by the arms STOP 
START the man was an UNK and he put up a UNK struggle four UNK women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived STOP 
START besides terror had UNK some of UNK vitality and will STOP 
START my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face STOP 
START in the UNK tongue UNK means UNK a quality which the women UNK UNK in weekly UNK at which great quantities of a UNK like UNK were UNK STOP 
START in the hut to which i was assigned max had his own quarters my food was brought to me by a wrinkled UNK with bare UNK UNK who seemed to enjoy UNK with me in UNK phrases STOP 
START her name was UNK and she told me many things STOP 
START for an UNK UNK old UNK was a mine of information STOP 
START though i had a great UNK of the island and felt i would never leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women STOP 
START her account was later confirmed by the UNK expedition from the university of UNK in 1951 STOP 
START from UNK i heard that until about UNK the people of this island which was about the size of guam or smaller had been of both sexes and that the normal family life of UNK tribes was observed here with minor variations STOP 
START but in the middle of the last century an island woman named UNK seized a UNK in the heat of an UNK battle and UNK the women after their men had fled STOP 
START UNK UNK and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred UNK from the UNK of UNK back to their war UNK after considerable loss of life on both sides STOP 
START UNK was something of a politician as well as a UNK STOP 
START she quickly UNK the UNK position she now occupied by UNK the UNK males and even putting many of them to death STOP 
START within a decade or less few men were left and a UNK society had UNK up STOP 
START UNK was great UNK told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children the UNK told me STOP 
START all men went away from here STOP 
START those who stayed had to pass tests STOP 
START few passed STOP 
START she UNK with UNK showing the UNK of UNK teeth STOP 
START UNK women then named this place UNK UNK for just the strongest men could stay here STOP 
START come i show you STOP 
START the old woman arose UNK and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood STOP 
START in the shade of a palm tree in front of the UNK dwelling i saw four figures in a UNK on the ground STOP

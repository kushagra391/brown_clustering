START had a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon STOP 
START sat there and as a woman sang she kept getting UNK and UNK right before my eyes and the eyes of some UNK other people STOP 
START i make this observation about the lady miss UNK UNK because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a british female reporter who UNK her terribly in london recently and then wrote in the paper the next day UNK UNK has arrived in london STOP 
START she's not UNK STOP 
START she's not UNK STOP 
START she's fat STOP 
START but who UNK when the lady UNK not the largest afternoon audience newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most UNK and quiet STOP 
START they UNK every number not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme sometimes at the first UNK STOP 
START and UNK sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed at times a blessed relief from the UNK UNK of the progressive UNK who have dominated these proceedings STOP 
START things like when you're smiling almost like being in love do it again born to UNK alone together who UNK UNK on the UNK how long has this been going on and her own personal songs like the man that got away and the inevitable over the UNK STOP 
START miss UNK is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb UNK STOP 
START at the start of her program there were UNK of UNK STOP 
START she had held to the letter of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m. the appointed hour although the music at newport people had tried to get the program UNK at 3 STOP 
START then there was a bad delay in getting UNK UNK UNK orchestra UNK into its chairs STOP 
START along about UNK just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side UNK came on singing in a UNK blue dress with a blue and white jacket that UNK in the wind STOP 
START her UNK UNK was fortunately UNK on the left which happened to be the direction from which a UNK breeze was blowing STOP 
START in her first song she waved away one UNK UNK who dared approach the UNK UNK and thereafter the boys with the UNK had to UNK their 300 UNK UNK and shoot at extreme range STOP 
START there also came a brief UNK with the sound UNK who made the mistake of being UNK during a quiet moment near the conclusion of do it again and she made the UNK observation that i never saw so much moving about in an audience STOP 
START but it didn't take UNK UNK UNK long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it STOP 
START before her UNK was finished she was UNK UNK sheets of music UNK UNK about the stage helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere STOP 
START and time after time she really UNK out her songs STOP 
START sometimes they struck me as UNK UNK which was the way i felt about her come rain or come UNK and sometimes they were just plain magnificent like her UNK beautiful beautiful weather STOP 
START to her partisan audience such UNK UNK would have seemed nothing more than a critic UNK to hold his UNK just sat back on their UNK and cried for more as though they could never get enough STOP 
START they were UNK with splendid exciting singing STOP 
START her UNK your baby was as good as it can be done and her really personal songs like the man that got away were deeply moving STOP 
START the audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard over the UNK although the fellow that kept crying for get happy had to go home unhappy about that item anyway STOP 
START she was generous with her UNK and the audience was equally so with its UNK and applause and flowers STOP 
START all went home happy except the newport police who feared that the UNK UNK at UNK might meet UNK the night crowd drawing UNK and those UNK of their happy hour at the cocktail bar STOP 
START in newport last night there were UNK of distant lightning in the northern skies STOP 
START this was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening UNK in the distance but no storm STOP 
START several times it came near breaking and there were in fact some lovely UNK of thunder from jerry UNK big band which is about as fine an UNK as has come along in the jazz business since john UNK found count UNK working in a kansas city trap STOP 
START UNK band has been UNK with his solid sense of swing and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert UNK STOP 
START but what is equally impressive is the UNK and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and UNK UNK UNK in a UNK UNK like bob UNK arrangement of UNK UNK STOP 
START for subtle swinging rhythms i could UNK UNK UNK version of weep and the UNK went on display in 18 UNK for robert a UNK tribute to johnny hodges STOP 
START there was considerable contrast between this UNK performance and that of art UNK and the jazz UNK who are able to UNK a tremendous sound for such a small group STOP 
START unfortunately UNK doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein STOP 
START he UNK to have his UNK performing and thus we get only brief UNK of what his ensemble work is like STOP 
START what we did get however was impressive STOP 
START a few drops of rain just before midnight when sarah UNK was in the midst of her first number scattered the more UNK members of the audience briefly but at this hour and with sarah on the stand most of the listeners didn't care whether they got wet STOP 
START miss UNK was back in top form somehow UNK and improved with the passage of time like a fine wine STOP 
START after the UNK of female UNK we have been having all of whom took sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever STOP 
START jazz three open program the evening program was opened by the jazz three a newport group consisting of UNK UNK on bass jack UNK drums and don cook piano STOP 
START this was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out saturday night when the eddie UNK group also local talent went on first STOP 
START putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a UNK purpose it UNK the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this UNK spot when the audience is cold restless and in flux UNK UNK from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous newport audience STOP 
START the jazz three displayed their sound UNK not only in their own chosen set but as the emergency UNK for al UNK UNK james the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years gradually moving up from a morning UNK on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program STOP 
START UNK wilson UNK UNK wilson a vigorous UNK without many wild UNK sang a set a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old UNK as UNK UNK the UNK of UNK and the delightful sunday STOP 
START she UNK the cake with the always reliable bill UNK STOP 
START from this taste of the UNK we leaped way out to UNK UNK private brand of progressive jazz which did lovely subtle things for UNK UNK and UNK and a couple of UNK STOP 
START UNK is a difficult musician to UNK STOP 
START he plays his UNK UNK for beauty of tone rather than for UNK flights of meaningless UNK and he has a quiet way of getting back and UNK the melody after the UNK is over STOP 
START in this he is UNK with tradition however far removed from it he may seem to be STOP 
START UNK takes over george UNK took over with his well disciplined group a UNK consisting of UNK guitar bass drums UNK piano and a UNK UNK STOP 
START he met with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swung from jazz to latin american things like the UNK STOP 
START UNK himself seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent newport appearances STOP 
START a very casual pleasant program one of those UNK things that make UNK afternoon programs such a UNK delight was held again under sunny skies hot sun and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach STOP 
START divided almost equally into two parts it consisted of the evolution of the blues UNK by UNK UNK who had presented it last year at the UNK calif. jazz festival and an UNK session of UNK UNK and his orchestra a UNK big band STOP 
START UNK story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him STOP 
START tracing the blues from its african roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the west UNK he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the negro churches STOP 
START surprise addition to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had big miller as a UNK and UNK dean UNK while UNK brown jr. an extremely UNK young man did a slave UNK call a UNK work song and a beautifully sung negro UNK brown baby which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival STOP 
START one of those delightful surprise UNK which so frequently occur in jazz programs was an excellent UNK at the drums by the great joe jones UNK to old man river which seems to have been elected the favorite UNK for the boys on the UNK at this year's concerts STOP 
START UNK the primitive african rhythmic UNK of the blues was michael UNK UNK who plays such native drums as the UNK and even does a UNK job UNK his own chest STOP 
START he has been on previous newport programs and was one of the UNK of last year's afternoon concerts STOP 
START UNK had billy mitchell UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK blues UNK and a good one and the UNK UNK UNK which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now helping him with the musical examples STOP 
START it all went very well STOP 
START UNK who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in UNK UNK STOP 
START music UNK who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example played for UNK by UNK UNK STOP 
START he has chosen UNK UNK UNK in aj STOP 
START the playing takes both sides of the UNK STOP 
START perhaps one of the reasons these UNK are not UNK more often is their great length STOP 
START rhythmic interest UNK beauty and the UNK of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention with the UNK playing STOP 
START his technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully STOP 
START the male chorus of the robert UNK UNK UNK sea UNK in fine style STOP 
START the group is UNK trained STOP 
START what a discussion can UNK when the title of this type of song is in question STOP 
START do you say UNK as if the word were derived from the french word UNK to sing or do you say UNK and think of a roughly built cabin which UNK its name from the UNK use of the word UNK with one of its meanings given as a UNK say UNK STOP 
START either way the robert UNK chorus UNK them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame UNK out in terms of agreeable listening STOP 
START if your favorite song is not here it must be an UNK one STOP 
START the london label offers an UNK UNK by UNK UNK a UNK whose fame is international STOP

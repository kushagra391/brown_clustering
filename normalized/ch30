START between meetings he helps the president keep track of UNK matters STOP 
START since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential UNK one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both jobs STOP 
START since faculty see themselves as UNK UNK rather than as employees enthusiasm in a common enterprise is UNK to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that UNK its course STOP 
START the faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship STOP 
START the president expects faculty members to remember in UNK their autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the UNK income nor are they personally UNK for UNK decisions STOP 
START he may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he has a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matters to the administration STOP 
START how well do faculty members UNK themselves is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government STOP 
START they sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government STOP 
START they too need to learn to UNK STOP 
START letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to UNK themselves about education as a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention STOP 
START although UNK insist on governing themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively UNK in college or university government STOP 
START there are nevertheless several things that the president can do to UNK participation and to UNK the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege STOP 
START he can for example present significant UNK issues to the senate STOP 
START he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the UNK faculty making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments UNK good UNK between the committees and the administration UNK the number of committees STOP 
START despite the many UNK for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration UNK of a lack of communication UNK STOP 
START the cause is as often neglect as UNK to UNK STOP 
START a busy president UNK with a problem and its UNK and UNK by pressures to meet UNK tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is STOP 
START the need for UNK and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of UNK STOP 
START to increase faculty influence and decrease tension many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly STOP 
START the president has little influence in UNK UNK changes but if he looks ahead two three or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas he can open the way for UNK and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take STOP 
START success will require UNK sensitivity to faculty UNK patience and UNK STOP 
START the critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually UNK and UNK itself so that its performance will match changing social demands STOP 
START great professors do not automatically UNK themselves STOP 
START UNK can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty STOP 
START they serve not only as spokesmen for their areas but they also contribute to UNK decision making STOP 
START the president who UNK strong men who have an UNK or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance STOP 
START faculty members depend on their department UNK to promote their interests with the administration STOP 
START the administration at the same time looks to the UNK for strategic aid in building stronger departments STOP 
START one way that this can be done other than by UNK new UNK professors is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance STOP 
START the quality of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty STOP 
START by supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards the president can encourage faculty leadership STOP 
START indirectly he can best help them by UNK that UNK criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and UNK to STOP 
START the academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty development STOP 
START an alert dean will UNK all through the year on personnel needs plans for the future qualifications of those on the job and bright prospects elsewhere STOP 
START for the maintenance of a long-term program the departments and particularly their UNK are strategic STOP 
START they evaluate and UNK candidates for appointment and promotion STOP 
START to provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also UNK candidates thoroughly STOP 
START at some colleges and universities a faculty committee UNK and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates STOP 
START some faculty members and many UNK oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act pro UNK STOP 
START they can be effective however if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work STOP 
START at one university the president UNK the faculty review committee as a valued partner of the administration in UNK and promoting the quality of the faculty STOP 
START before the president UNK a candidate to the trustees the administration UNK the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere STOP 
START the president or dean reads some of his publications to form the UNK possible evaluation of the quality of his mind STOP 
START no good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria STOP 
START to avoid passing over quiet UNK teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made UNK whether or not they have been recommended for UNK by their departments STOP 
START there are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly STOP 
START he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure to guard against the mistake of making this UNK serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements STOP 
START no one can be as effective as the president in UNK older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their UNK is quite different STOP 
START in particular the president may have to UNK all his UNK powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale STOP 
START on those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action STOP 
START a true university like most successful marriages is a unity of UNK without forcing all components into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider UNK of knowledge at its highest level which a university in contrast to a UNK should stand for STOP 
START recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into UNK goals STOP 
START each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as shall we require a liberal education built around a UNK core for all UNK shall we permit early UNK in scientific and technological subjects the first instance adequate appropriate reading materials and library UNK must be planned STOP 
START in the second more shops UNK and staff will be required STOP 
START for the president a master plan looking ahead five years the maximum reach for sound UNK offers several practical advantages STOP 
START trustees faculty and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made instead of afterwards STOP 
START physical plant and equipment can be UNK developed STOP 
START proposed new programs can be examined for UNK to goals and for present and future financial UNK STOP 
START more than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts STOP 
START it UNK confidence in his UNK determination to establish goals and to achieve them STOP 
START before deciding where it is going however a college or university must know where it is STOP 
START the first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty by outside UNK or by a combination of the two STOP 
START it should UNK UNK UNK faculty organization buildings faculty work UNK and potential for growth in stature and size STOP 
START UNK of the master plan will inevitably be UNK STOP 
START some departments will attack their new goals UNK may drag their feet STOP 
START funds may be readily UNK for some purposes but not others STOP 
START a plan must therefore be brought up to date UNK possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer STOP 
START to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions a number of institutions have established offices of UNK research STOP 
START some offices have very broad responsibilities touching on almost all aspects of a UNK UNK program STOP 
START their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations STOP 
START more often these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data STOP 
START the president's opportunity for UNK education reaches its highest point as he decides which projects he will cut back which he will advance by increased allowances or new UNK efforts STOP 
START no matter how high the hopes and dreams of UNK budget making UNK them to the cold realities of dollars and cents STOP 
START when the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget to which his faith and credit are committed principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment STOP 
START he cannot of course examine each proposal from UNK STOP 
START he UNK and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution STOP 
START UNK must be flexible to allow UNK to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship STOP 
START because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money an institution should choose its fields of UNK STOP 
START otherwise it will be headed for UNK at worst and at best towards UNK of other less dramatic but socially and UNK indispensable branches of learning STOP 
START in the national interest even the UNK universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the UNK in all branches STOP 
START supporting activities business management public relations UNK offer presidents one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education STOP 
START here the reasonable UNK of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role STOP 
START in the areas that do not UNK directly to the educational program expert UNK will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention STOP 
START the president should find strong UNK and UNK the UNK discretion to them STOP 
START higher education cannot compete with the salary UNK of the business world but an educational institution can offer many UNK UNK UNK to members of the business community that will UNK the differences in income STOP 
START just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives so should UNK officers STOP 
START they will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals STOP 
START a president is frequently UNK to serve in UNK civic and governmental UNK to make speeches to lay groups and to make numerous UNK appearances on and off campus STOP 
START since he can neither accept nor UNK them all he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations STOP 
START UNK and UNK are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution UNK his acceptance STOP 
START by sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues the president can develop a UNK of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution something more than the UNK shadow of one man STOP

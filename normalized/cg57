START but it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions at the point just reached STOP 
START fortunately it is possible to be somewhat more concrete and UNK in UNK the involvement of values in education STOP 
START for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and psychological studies of students in american colleges and universities and particularly from the UNK values studies STOP 
START in the latter research program information is available for UNK UNK students UNK in 1950 and for UNK students UNK in 1952 STOP 
START of the latter sample UNK persons had been studied two years earlier changes in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals at two points in time STOP 
START in addition the 1952 study collected comparable data from UNK students at ten other colleges and universities scattered across the country dartmouth harvard yale UNK north carolina UNK texas university of california at los angeles wayne and michigan STOP 
START we find in the first place that the students UNK approve of higher education UNK evaluate the job their own institution is doing do not accept most of the criticisms UNK against higher education in the public UNK and on the whole approve of the way their university deals with UNK and value UNK STOP 
START it is not our impression that these UNK are UNK UNK UNK of UNK ignorance the UNK of these students find their university experience UNK to their own sense of values STOP 
START students are approximately equally divided between those who regard vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those who chose a general liberal education STOP 
START other conceivable goals such as UNK and social adjustment are of secondary importance to them STOP 
START the ideal of a liberal education UNK itself upon the students more and more as they move through college STOP 
START even in such technical UNK as engineering the senior is much more likely than the UNK to choose as an ideal liberal education over specific vocational preparation STOP 
START in the university UNK of scholarship and research of social diversity of new ideas and varied and UNK interests UNK into a campus culture apparently means UNK appreciation of the idea of a liberal education in the arts and sciences STOP 
START UNK choices of ideal educational goals are not arbitrary or UNK STOP 
START there is a clear relationship between their educational UNK and their basic pattern of general values STOP 
START the selective and UNK qualities of basic UNK are clearly evident in these data the UNK students choose vocational preparation the UNK choose goals of social adjustment getting along with people the intellectuals choose a liberal arts emphasis STOP 
START the same UNK consistency shows itself in occupational choices STOP 
START there is impressive consistency between specific occupational UNK and the UNK basic conception of what is for him a good way of life STOP 
START and contrary to many popular UNK the UNK chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to UNK success nor to mere conformity STOP 
START our students want UNK that permit them to use their talents and training to be creative and original to work with and to help other people STOP 
START they also want money prestige and security STOP 
START but they are optimistic about their prospects in these UNK set limits to their aspirations few UNK to millions of dollars or to imperial power and glory STOP 
START within the fixed frame of these aspirations they can afford to place a high value on the UNK and UNK aspects of occupation and to minimize the UNK values of power prestige and wealth STOP 
START occupational choices are also useful and interesting in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute the only component in goals and aspirations STOP 
START for there is also the face of reality in the form of the individual's UNK of his own abilities and interests of the objective possibilities open to him of the UNK and other social pressures to which he is exposed STOP 
START we find reluctant UNK whose values are not in line with their expected UNK characteristics STOP 
START students develop occupational images not always accurate or detailed and they try to fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation STOP 
START the purely UNK or UNK problems are often acute STOP 
START furthermore many reluctant UNK are UNK to social demands or UNK in the face of their own limitations of opportunity or of ability and performance STOP 
START thus many a UNK UNK for a career in architecture drama or journalism UNK himself to a real estate business a UNK student who dreams of the UNK decides to enter his father's advertising agency many a hopeful UNK business executive decides it were better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice it STOP 
START the old ideal of the independent UNK is UNK but so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate UNK STOP 
START in their views on UNK UNK sex and family life our students prefer what they are expected to prefer STOP 
START for them in the grim words of a UNK song love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage STOP 
START their expressed standards concerning sex roles desirable age for marriage characteristics of an ideal mate number of children desired are UNK with the values and UNK of the preceding generation UNK UNK rebellion STOP 
START they even accept the double standard of sex morality in a double sense i.e. both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards for women and women apply to both sexes a standard different from that held by men STOP 
START UNK and UNK seem implied by what has just been said STOP 
START but these terms are UNK STOP 
START in the field of political values it is certainly true that students are not radical not rebels against their parents or their UNK STOP 
START and as they go through college the students tend to bring their political position in line with that UNK in the social groups to which they belong STOP 
START yet they have accepted most of the UNK welfare state provisions for health security and the regulation of economic affairs and they UNK approve of the traditional liberalism of the bill of rights STOP 
START when their faith in civil UNK is tested against strong pressures of social UNK in specific issues e.g. UNK of dangerous ideas many UNK and give in STOP 
START the students who are most willing to UNK in the UNK of civil UNK are also those who are most likely to be UNK against minority groups to be UNK and UNK in general social attitudes and to lack a basic faith in people STOP 
START as one looks at the existing evidence one finds a correlation although only a slight one between high grades and UNK values STOP 
START but the correlation is substantial only among UNK STOP 
START in other words as students go through college those who are most successful UNK tend to become more committed to a bill of rights orientation STOP 
START college in gross just the general experience may have varying effects but the students who are successful emerge with UNK and UNK democratic values STOP 
START this finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are more likely to be UNK of the values implicit in civil UNK than the other students STOP 
START there is now substantial evidence from several major studies of college students that the experience of the college years results in a certain selective UNK of attitudes and values STOP 
START detached from their prior UNK and social groups and exposed to the UNK UNK of the university UNK the students tend to UNK a new common culture to UNK toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus STOP 
START furthermore in certain respects there are norms common to colleges and universities across the country STOP 
START for instance UNK people consistently show up in study after study as more often than others UNK of the bill of rights and other democratic rights and UNK STOP 
START the interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which students tend to UNK include UNK of diversity STOP 
START to the extent that our sampling of the UNK of american college students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our culture and still valid in 1959 we are disposed to question the summary UNK of the current generation as silent beat UNK or as a mass of UNK UNK who are guided solely by social radar without benefit of inner UNK STOP 
START our data indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing institutions of the society and in the face of the realities of complex and UNK economic and political problems make a UNK and UNK delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of UNK responsibility for UNK with such collective concerns STOP 
START in a real sense they are UNK conservative but their UNK UNK a UNK UNK of the original UNK of UNK STOP 
START although we have no measures of its strength or intensity the heritage of the doctrine of UNK rights is retained STOP 
START as they move through the college years our young men and women are UNK into a UNK similar culture at the level of personal behavior STOP 
START in this sense also they are surely UNK STOP 
START it is even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity everyone does it as a criterion for conduct STOP 
START but the extent of ethical UNK is easily UNK STOP 
START few students are really so UNK in the UNK crowd of the swelling population in our institutions of higher learning STOP 
START and it may be well to recall that to say conformity is in part another way of saying orderly human society STOP 
START in the field of religious beliefs and values the college students seem to UNK reflect the surrounding culture STOP 
START their commitments are for the most part UNK in a familiar UNK STOP 
START students UNK to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy STOP 
START UNK UNK or UNK are so rare as to be a curiosity STOP 
START the religious quest is often intense and deep and there are students on every campus who are seriously UNK with the most profound questions of meaning and value STOP 
START at the same time a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means of personal adjustment an anchor for family life a source of emotional security STOP 
START these personal and social goals often UNK the goals of intellectual clarity and spiritual UNK STOP 
START the cult of adjustment does exist STOP 
START it exists alongside the acceptance of traditional forms of organized religion church UNK personnel ritual UNK STOP 
START still another UNK of the student population consists of those who seek in what they regard as religion intellectual clarity rational belief and ethical guidance and UNK STOP 
START our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly orthodox and UNK involved STOP 
START upon second thought we were forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical UNK against which we might compare the present situation and that conclusions that present-day students are more or less religious could not be defended on the basis of our data STOP 
START as we looked more UNK at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation we received the impression that many of the religious convictions expressed represented a conventional acceptance of low intensity STOP 
START but here again comparative UNK are lacking and we do not know in any case what measure of UNK and intensity to expect from healthy young secure and relatively UNK persons all feelings of immortality and UNK are standard UNK of youth STOP 
START nor are optimistic and UNK UNK at all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country STOP 
START UNK recently has UNK evidence regarding changes in values during a period of years primarily UNK but extending much farther back in some instances STOP 
START a variety of data are assembled to bear upon such UNK changes as UNK UNK morality UNK UNK individualism achievement UNK emphasis on UNK orientation in favor of UNK moral UNK consideration and UNK conformity UNK UNK orientation STOP 
START although he questions the extent and nature of the UNK UNK of religion and the UNK increase in conformity and thinks that UNK UNK orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed to it he does conclude that americans increasingly enjoy leisure without guilt do not stress achievement so much as formerly are more accepting of group harmony as a goal more UNK of diversity and aware of other cultures STOP

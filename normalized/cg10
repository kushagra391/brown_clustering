START the north and the south were in greater agreement on sovereignty through all their dispute about it than were the founding fathers STOP 
START the truth in their UNK concepts was UNK by UNK of the UNK of UNK and UNK and defended in the end by leaders of the UNK of lincoln and lee STOP 
START the people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles in understanding of and belief in the federal balance and in love of their union STOP 
START repeated efforts beginning with the missouri compromise of UNK were made by such master UNK as clay and douglas to resolve the difference UNK by compromise rather than clear thought and UNK action STOP 
START even so confusion in this period gained such strength from compromise and other factors that it led to the UNK war of the nineteenth century STOP 
START nothing can show more than this the UNK of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty STOP 
START the present issue in UNK whether to UNK an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens UNK the american one of UNK rather than the one that was resolved by civil war STOP 
START and so i would only touch upon it now much as i have long wanted to write a book about it STOP 
START i think it is essential however to UNK here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in UNK if only to see better how UNK is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject STOP 
START the difference came down to this the southern states insisted that the united states was in last analysis what its name implied a union of states STOP 
START to their leaders the constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states who therefore retained the right to UNK from it STOP 
START this right of the state its UNK contended was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of UNK power in the union government STOP 
START the UNK of the union maintained that the constitution had formed UNK the united people of america that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states and that therefore the states had no right to UNK though the citizens could STOP 
START writing to speed on august 24 UNK lincoln made the latter point clear STOP 
START in UNK terms whose UNK is startling today he thus declared his own right to UNK STOP 
START we began by UNK that all men are created equal STOP 
START we now practically read it all men are created equal except negroes STOP 
START when the UNK get control it will read all men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and catholics STOP 
START when it comes to this i shall prefer UNK to some country where they make no UNK of loving liberty to russia for instance where UNK can be taken pure without the base UNK of UNK his emphasis STOP 
START when the southern states exercised their right to UNK they formed what they officially UNK the confederate states of america STOP 
START UNK as we have seen still UNK this government along with the articles of UNK of UNK as an example of a UNK STOP 
START the fact is that the southern UNK differed from the earlier one almost as much as the federal constitution did STOP 
START the confederate constitution UNK much of the federal constitution UNK and most of the rest in substance STOP 
START it operated on by and for the people individually just as did the federal constitution STOP 
START it made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments and among the executive legislative and judicial branches STOP 
START the difference between UNK and federal union in UNK many believe and UNK that the great difference between the constitution of the southern UNK and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to UNK STOP 
START but though each of its members had asserted this right against the union the final constitution which the UNK signed on march 11 nearly a month before UNK began included no explicit provision UNK a state to UNK STOP 
START its UNK discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution STOP 
START their president jefferson davis interpreted their constitution to mean that it UNK of no UNK association but this remained so doubtful that there were frequent demands that the right to UNK be put into the constitution STOP 
START the constitution of the southern UNK differed from that of the federal union only in two important respects it openly UNK recognized slavery an institution which the southerners of UNK even though they continued it found so impossible to UNK with freedom that they carefully avoided UNK the word in the federal constitution STOP 
START they recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest and that to recognize it UNK in their constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the declaration of UNK that all men are created equal that they are UNK by their creator with certain UNK rights that among them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness STOP 
START the other important difference between the two UNK was that the president of the UNK held office for six instead of four years and was limited to one term STOP 
START these are not however differences in federal structure STOP 
START the only important differences from that standpoint between the two UNK lies in their UNK STOP 
START the one of UNK made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states whereas the UNK of UNK expressed as clearly as language can the opposite concept that they were acting directly as citizens STOP 
START here are the two UNK federal constitution UNK we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic UNK provide for the common UNK promote the general welfare and secure the UNK of liberty to ourselves and our UNK do UNK and establish this constitution for the united states of america STOP 
START confederate constitution UNK we the people of the confederate states each state acting in its sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal government establish justice insure domestic UNK and secure the UNK of liberty to ourselves and our UNK UNK the favor and the guidance of UNK god do UNK and establish this constitution for the confederate states of america STOP 
START one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two UNK the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought STOP 
START but though the southern states when UNK a constitution to UNK themselves UNK the difference to this fine point by UNK to assert the right to UNK the fact remained that by UNK from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states STOP 
START if the union conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to UNK this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union STOP 
START lincoln saw that the act of UNK made the issue for the union a vital one whether it was a union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live or an association of sovereign states that must fall UNK either to UNK or UNK STOP 
START much as he UNK slavery lincoln was always willing to UNK to each slave state the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it STOP 
START though his election was interpreted by many southerners as the UNK of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the constitution gave the states STOP 
START after the war began he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by union action even in the border states that stayed with the union STOP 
START he issued his emancipation proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the union STOP 
START in his message of december 2 UNK he put his purpose and his policy in these words which i would call the lincoln law of UNK in giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free STOP 
START what lincoln could not UNK was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the union STOP 
START he fought to the end to preserve it as a government of the people by the people for the people STOP 
START the truth on each side won in the civil war the fact that the americans who UNK the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more UNK in slavery the UNK of individual liberty made the conflict UNK and the greater STOP 
START out of this UNK the citizen emerged in the south as in the north as america's true sovereign in a new birth of freedom as lincoln promised STOP 
START but before this came about UNK americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states STOP 
START on their decisive UNK lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave men living and dead who fought here STOP 
START he understood that both sides were at fault and he reached the height of saying so UNK in his second UNK STOP 
START to my knowledge lincoln remains the only head of state and UNK who while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt proved man enough to say this publicly to give his UNK the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error and in all our error some truth STOP 
START so great a man could not but understand too that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought which their opponents see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend STOP 
START it is much less difficult now than in UNK day to see that on both sides sovereign americans had given their lives in the civil war to maintain the balance between the powers they had UNK to the states and to their union STOP 
START they differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth that individual life liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two and on the UNK of sovereignty in all its aspects which this involves STOP 
START the UNK americans who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent UNK preserved individual freedom in the united states from the dangers of UNK inherent in UNK which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states and to the UNK of their people STOP 
START but the fact that UNK other americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served UNK in other essential ways STOP 
START its appeal from UNK to bullets at fort UNK ended by UNK the southerners their right to have slaves a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man STOP 
START the very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method war led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for since it forced lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure STOP 
START there was a divine justice in one wrong thus UNK another STOP 
START there was also a lesson one that has served ever since to keep americans in their UNK with one another from turning from the ballot to the bullet STOP 
START yet though the southern states lost the worst errors in their case they did not lose the truth they fought for STOP 
START the lives so many of them gave to UNK what they believed would be a fatal UNK by the union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to UNK all americans against UNK other UNK STOP

START UNK of iodine the precise mechanism for UNK of iodine in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood STOP 
START however the formation of UNK bound iodine mainly UNK can be accomplished in UNK systems STOP 
START in the absence of UNK to the UNK the product formed is an UNK UNK protein UNK and UNK 1953 UNK and UNK 1955 UNK UNK and UNK 1956 and UNK 1958 UNK and UNK 1960 STOP 
START this UNK does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid and there is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be UNK in UNK by UNK systems STOP 
START in addition the UNK acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is UNK STOP 
START if UNK and a system UNK hydrogen UNK are added to a UNK UNK of the thyroid large quantities of free UNK can be formed alexander 1959 STOP 
START it is not clear whether this system bears any resemblance to the in UNK UNK mechanism and a system UNK UNK has not been identified in thyroid tissue STOP 
START on chemical grounds it seems most likely that UNK is first converted to af and then to af as the active UNK species STOP 
START in the thyroid UNK it appears that proteins chiefly thyroglobulin are UNK and that free UNK and UNK are not UNK STOP 
START UNK of UNK however is not enough for the synthesis of hormone STOP 
START the UNK and UNK must be coupled to form UNK and UNK STOP 
START the mechanism of this UNK has been studied in some detail with UNK systems in UNK and can be UNK by certain UNK UNK UNK and james 1958 STOP 
START there is so far no evidence to indicate UNK that this UNK is under UNK control STOP 
START the chemical nature of the UNK is discussed below UNK UNK et UNK STOP 
START c STOP 
START UNK synthesis little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of thyroglobulin STOP 
START its synthesis has not been demonstrated in UNK systems nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in UNK been UNK proven STOP 
START there is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of UNK for in certain UNK UNK of the UNK thyroid containing essentially no UNK thyroglobulin a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in UNK experiments UNK UNK and UNK 1959 STOP 
START similar findings have been noted in a patient with UNK absence of the UNK enzymes whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate UNK STOP 
START in addition depending on availability of UNK iodine thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of iodine STOP 
START d STOP 
START UNK since the UNK thyroid UNK are the UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK section c it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid UNK for their release from proteins before UNK STOP 
START the presence of several UNK and UNK has been demonstrated in the thyroid STOP 
START one of the UNK has UNK optimum of about UNK and another of about UNK UNK stanley and UNK 1954 UNK and UNK 1955 STOP 
START the finding that the concentration of one of these UNK is increased in thyroid UNK from UNK animals suggests that this UNK may be active in UNK STOP 
START there is no conclusive evidence yet that either of the UNK has been prepared in highly UNK form nor is their UNK known STOP 
START a study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that UNK is not UNK released and that the UNK proceeds UNK with the formation of UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK 1956 STOP 
START besides UNK enzymes the thyroid UNK UNK enzymes STOP 
START a UNK UNK with a UNK optimum of around 8 and requiring reduced UNK UNK for activity has been identified in the thyroid UNK 1957 STOP 
START this UNK UNK is effective against UNK and UNK but does not UNK UNK or UNK STOP 
START it is assumed that the iodine released from the UNK remains in the UNK pool of the thyroid where it is UNK and UNK into thyroglobulin STOP 
START the UNK and UNK released by UNK and so UNK UNK presumably UNK into the blood stream STOP 
START it has been shown that thyroglobulin UNK UNK but the binding does not appear to be particularly strong STOP 
START it has been suggested that the plasma UNK proteins which have an extremely high UNK for UNK compete with thyroglobulin for UNK UNK and UNK 1957 STOP 
START e STOP 
START UNK drugs UNK drugs are of two general types STOP 
START one type has a small UNK UNK of the UNK type STOP 
START this UNK UNK thyroid hormone synthesis by UNK with UNK concentration in the thyroid STOP 
START it does not appear to affect the UNK mechanism as such STOP 
START the other group of UNK agents or drugs is UNK by UNK STOP 
START these drugs have no effect on the UNK UNK mechanism but they UNK UNK STOP 
START the mechanism of action of these drugs has not been completely worked out but certain of them appear to act by reducing the UNK form of iodine before it can UNK thyroglobulin UNK 1954 STOP 
START on the other hand there are a few UNK drugs of this same general type such as UNK UNK no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine STOP 
START any of the UNK drugs of either type if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause UNK UNK to UNK of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK of the pituitary then UNK by an increased output of tsh causing the thyroid to UNK STOP 
START the effect of drugs that act on the UNK mechanism can be UNK by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet STOP 
START the UNK drugs of the UNK type however are not UNK by such means STOP 
START besides those of the UNK and UNK types certain UNK drugs have been found in naturally occurring foods STOP 
START the most UNK identified is UNK which was isolated from UNK UNK 1950 STOP 
START it is presumed to occur in other members of the UNK family STOP 
START there is some evidence that naturally occurring UNK may play a role in the development of UNK particularly in UNK and australia UNK and UNK 1956 STOP 
START there it seems that the UNK UNK by dairy animals is itself UNK but is converted in the animal to an active UNK which is then UNK in the milk STOP 
START f STOP 
START UNK influences besides the presence of UNK in the diet the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid UNK STOP 
START in the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in UNK iodine causes thyroid UNK UNK and increased thyroid activity money UNK and UNK 1952 UNK UNK UNK UNK and del UNK 1954 STOP 
START in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of UNK is about 100 UNK per day STOP 
START with lower levels thyroid UNK and increased thyroid UNK enable the thyroid to UNK a larger proportion of the daily UNK of iodine STOP 
START further the UNK is able to UNK a larger fraction of the thyroid hormone UNK UNK STOP 
START in the presence of a low iodine UNK thyroglobulin UNK in UNK with af is found to contain more UNK than normal the amounts of UNK and UNK being UNK reduced STOP 
START this appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid UNK of newly UNK thyroglobulin STOP 
START if the deficiency UNK long enough it is reasonable to suppose that the af label will reflect the af distribution in the thyroglobulin STOP 
START similar results might be expected from the influence of drugs or UNK conditions that limit UNK UNK or UNK or UNK thyroglobulin UNK STOP 
START b STOP 
START -hlthe UNK hormone the name UNK hormone tsh has been given to a substance found in the UNK pituitary UNK of all species of animal so tested for its presence STOP 
START the hormone has also been called UNK or UNK hormone STOP 
START at the present time we do not know by what UNK mechanism tsh acts on the thyroid but for UNK of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity may be estimated including release of iodine from the thyroid increase in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the UNK cells and increase in the UNK UNK of af STOP 
START here we shall restrict discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration of tsh in blood STOP 
START brown 1959 has reviewed generally the various methods of UNK tsh and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on the subject STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START UNK constitution and physical properties of pituitary tsh as long ago as UNK it was pointed out by UNK UNK that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid STOP 
START this connection was UNK by smith and smith UNK who showed that saline UNK of fresh UNK pituitary UNK could UNK the UNK UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START the first attempts to UNK tsh came a decade later when UNK and UNK UNK used UNK acid to separate the UNK tsh from insoluble UNK STOP 
START after their work other investigators applied UNK techniques to the problem as well as UNK with organic UNK such as UNK STOP 
START albert 1949 has concluded that the most active preparations of tsh made during this period from UNK to 1945 were probably about 100 to 300 times as UNK as the starting material STOP 
START much of this work has been reviewed by white 1944 and by albert 1949 STOP 
START developments up to about 1957 have been discussed by UNK 1958 STOP 
START in the last few years the application of UNK and other modern techniques to the problem of UNK tsh has led to further UNK UNK and UNK 1960 UNK and UNK 1960 STOP 
START the most active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators appear to be similar in UNK composition and physical properties STOP 
START two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in blood STOP 
START first is the UNK form of the hormone the same as that found in the UNK where it is UNK and stored what is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances will this concentration UNK from the normal level and in which direction is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary tsh if the UNK chemical information about blood tsh is to be discussed UNK STOP 
START the importance of knowing in what chemical forms the hormone may exist is UNK by the recent observation that there exists an UNK UNK tsh in blood drawn from many UNK patients adams 1958 STOP 
START whether this UNK tsh UNK UNK from pituitary tsh or is UNK normal tsh with its period of effectiveness modified by some other blood UNK cannot be decided without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary aj STOP 
START in UNK data on the concentration of tsh in blood one must examine UNK the UNK methods used to obtain them STOP 
START the introduction of the united states UNK reference standard in 1952 and the UNK and UNK of the UNK and international units of UNK activity have made it possible to compare results published by different investigators since that time STOP 
START we should like to UNK the importance of stating results solely in terms of international units of tsh activity and of avoiding the UNK of biological units STOP 
START for the most part this discussion will be confined to results obtained since the introduction of the reference standard STOP 
START a STOP 
START UNK preparations and units of UNK activity the international unit u. adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different UNK UNK and UNK 1955 has been defined as the amount of activity present in UNK mg of the international standard preparation STOP 
START the international unit is UNK with the UNK unit adopted in 1952 which was defined as the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the UNK reference substance STOP

START UNK feeling of identity with UNK UNK was UNK by her discovery of the coincidence that UNK UNK in the jewish cemetery in UNK referred to her as the UNK STOP 
START into the texture of this UNK of history and human drama henrietta as every artist UNK to do UNK UNK of her own UNK insights into human nature and especially in the remarkable story of the attraction and conflict between two so UNK and UNK characters as this pair into the relations of men and women in their relations she was the UNK and he the receiver UNK the UNK STOP 
START his feeling always UNK UNK from her STOP 
START one is so accustomed to think of men as the UNK who need but ask and receive and women as UNK and UNK that our UNK are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned and we UNK the woman as a UNK STOP 
START the very UNK of her convictions and logical UNK of her arguments UNK and UNK him to make greater efforts this is most UNK to men who expect every woman to UNK their UNK notions concerning her sex and when she does not immediately UNK her as eccentric and UNK STOP 
START she had the opportunity that few clever women can resist of showing her superiority in argument over a man STOP 
START women themselves have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside world and scarcely find any wrong in UNK to the UNK of a stronger will even when their UNK are UNK STOP 
START she was UNK herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done STOP 
START one who UNK such trials of character is either UNK UNK or too simple and UNK in faith in mankind to see the danger STOP 
START in any case but the last such a course is sure to UNK itself upon the individual moral powers no more than the physical and mental can bear UNK STOP 
START and in the last case a bitter disappointment but too often meets the UNK nature STOP 
START henrietta was UNK in the process of writing as the born writer does not merely a channel for the discharge of UNK information but a stimulus to the development of the creative powers of observation insight and intuition STOP 
START dr. UNK was so pleased with the quality of her UNK study of UNK UNK that he considered UNK it to the century magazine or UNK but he decided that its jewish subject probably would not interest them and published it in the UNK so our readers will be UNK instead STOP 
START under her father's influence it did not occur to henrietta that she might write on subjects outside the jewish field but she did begin writing for other UNK papers and thus increased her output and her audience STOP 
START and she wrote the UNK for an UNK on the subject of UNK UNK performed at the UNK festival which came in december STOP 
START by her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that papa and UNK gave her a life of dickens as a spur to her UNK STOP 
START another source of intellectual stimulus was opened to her at that time by the founding of UNK UNK university within walking distance of home STOP 
START it was established in a couple of buildings in the shopping district with only a few professors but all UNK men and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby UNK STOP 
START in september UNK thomas UNK UNK famous UNK came from england to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening of the university although it was a school for men only it afforded henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures STOP 
START in the following year her father UNK to give a course in UNK theology to UNK UNK students and this brought to the szold house a group of bright young jews who had come to baltimore to study and who enjoyed being fed and UNK by UNK and entertained by henrietta and rachel who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room on sunday evenings STOP 
START from philadelphia came UNK UNK and joseph jastrow STOP 
START UNK judge UNK UNK came to study UNK STOP 
START a smart UNK and ambitious young man well connected and with a UNK for getting in the good UNK of important people he was bound to go far STOP 
START joseph jastrow the younger son of the distinguished rabbi UNK jastrow was a friendly UNK fellow with a little UNK whose field was psychology and who was also a UNK and a UNK UNK STOP 
START his father was a good friend of rabbi szold and joe lived with the UNK for a while STOP 
START both these youths who greatly admired henrietta were somewhat younger than she as were also the neighboring UNK boys who were then studying medicine bright though they all were they could not possibly compete for her interest with papa whose mind although he never tried to UNK or UNK lesser lights with it naturally UNK theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were STOP 
START besides miss henrietta as she was generally known since she had put up her hair with a UNK in the back had little time to spare them from her teaching and writing UNK UNK became interested in her friend UNK UNK and joe jastrow the only young man who when he wrote had the UNK to address her as henrietta and signed himself joe fell in love with pretty sister rachel STOP 
START henrietta however was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with UNK older and more serious brother morris who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia with papa when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at UNK UNK temple there during its UNK absence in europe STOP 
START young morris who while attending the university of pennsylvania also taught and UNK a paper found time to write henrietta UNK letters on everything that engaged his interest from the acting of sarah UNK in philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of UNK on the jewish reform movement being UNK by the UNK union college in UNK STOP 
START unlike his younger brother joe he never presumed to address her more UNK than as my dear friend although he praised and UNK the UNK and purity of her style STOP 
START and when he complained of the lack of time for all he wanted to do henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning as she and papa did STOP 
START one thing papa had not taught henrietta was how to handle a young man as UNK and UNK as herself STOP 
START she could not resist the opportunity of showing her superiority in argument over a man which she had remarked as one of the UNK UNK of UNK UNK in her UNK way henrietta who in her story of UNK had indicated her own UNK to think of men as the UNK and women as UNK and UNK felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which morris jastrow took the slightest exception he objected to her stand on the UNK affair as well as on the radical reforms of dr. wise of UNK union college until once in sheer UNK he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything STOP 
START but that did not prevent him from writing more long letters or from coming to spend his christmas UNK with the UNK lively UNK in their pleasant house on UNK street STOP 
START UNK little women we've got father and mother and each other said UNK on the first page of UNK UNK little women i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out UNK some five hundred pages later in that popular story of the march family which had first appeared when henrietta was eight the szold family as it developed bore a striking resemblance to the UNK STOP 
START mr. march like benjamin szold was a UNK although of an UNK UNK UNK march like UNK szold was the competent manager of her UNK of girls of whom the UNK had only four to the UNK five STOP 
START but the march girls had their counterparts in the szold girls STOP 
START henrietta could easily identify herself with UNK march although UNK was not the UNK sister STOP 
START neither was henrietta UNK like UNK who frankly wished she were a boy and had deliberately UNK her name which like UNK was the UNK form of a boy's name STOP 
START but both were UNK and UNK both had UNK to control both loved languages especially english and german both were good teachers and wrote for publication STOP 
START each was her mother's assistant and UNK each stood out UNK in the family picture STOP 
START UNK szold was more like UNK the UNK march girl who learned that a woman's UNK kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but a wise wife and mother STOP 
START UNK UNK like UNK was from the start her mother's daughter UNK for her mother's role in life STOP 
START UNK like UNK march suffered ill health got UNK fever and had to be careful of her heart but that never UNK her spirits STOP 
START when her right hand was UNK by the UNK UNK learned to write with her left hand STOP 
START she wrote gay plays about the girls for family UNK like oh what fun comedy in three acts in which under UNK henrietta appeared as a UNK and UNK who was only a UNK less brilliant in high school than henrietta had been appeared as UNK STOP 
START UNK studied piano UNK in the UNK UNK of mr. UNK pupils she UNK UNK farewell to UNK most UNK to the special delight of rabbi jastrow at his home in UNK near philadelphia where the szold girls took turns visiting between the visits of the jastrow boys at the UNK in baltimore STOP 
START UNK like amy the youngest of the UNK was the UNK UNK rather UNK and ambitious one STOP 
START for rachel conceded to be the UNK of the szold girls and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the UNK UNK her guitar and singing in her UNK tones there was no particular march UNK both groups were so closely UNK that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content the one being definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian STOP 
START the UNK like the UNK enjoyed and loved living together even in troubled times as in the march home any young man who called on the UNK found himself confronted with a UNK of UNK which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them STOP 
START this included UNK UNK generous and pretty with whom they all fell in love just as papa had first fallen in love with her UNK before he chose her when a young man like morris jastrow had enjoyed the szold UNK he felt obliged to send his respects and his gifts not merely to henrietta in whom he was really interested but to all the szold girls and UNK STOP 
START and just as UNK lawrence was first attracted to bright UNK march who found him UNK by her high standards and then had to content himself with her younger sister amy so joe jastrow who had also been writing henrietta before he came to UNK UNK had to content himself with her younger sister pretty rachel STOP 
START and like UNK march who saw her sisters UNK and amy involved in UNK before herself henrietta saw her sisters rachel and UNK drawn outside their family circle by the attraction of UNK rachel by joe jastrow and UNK by max UNK a young UNK who would write her romantic UNK of his trips by UNK down the mississippi STOP

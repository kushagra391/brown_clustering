START the united states is always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice STOP 
START certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the united states has no intention of UNK in the internal affairs of any nation the same UNK we UNK any soviet attempt to UNK its system on us or other peoples by force or UNK STOP 
START now this concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort STOP 
START not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries will not act in any way which would UNK our solemn commitments to them STOP 
START we and our friends are of course concerned with UNK STOP 
START growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress in freedom of the UNK and newly emerging nations STOP 
START these peoples desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not by our neglect be forced to seek help from and finally become UNK UNK of those who proclaim their UNK to freedom STOP 
START but they must have technical and investment assistance STOP 
START this is a problem to be solved not by america alone but also by every nation UNK the same ideals and in position to provide help STOP 
START in recent years america's partners and friends in western europe and japan have made great economic progress STOP 
START the international economy of 1960 is UNK different from that of the early postwar years STOP 
START no longer is the united states the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so UNK needed in the newly developed countries STOP 
START to remain secure and UNK themselves wealthy nations must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will UNK hope confidence and progress STOP 
START a rich nation can for a time without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of UNK making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens thus UNK its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and UNK society of nations STOP 
START but the UNK it will UNK the isolation into which it will UNK and the internal moral and spiritual UNK that will be UNK will in the long term bring it to economic and political disaster STOP 
START america did not become great through UNK and UNK STOP 
START her UNK progress in material achievements UNK from other qualities far more worthy and substantial UNK to principles and methods UNK with our religious philosophy satisfaction in hard work readiness to sacrifice for UNK causes courage to meet every challenge intellectual UNK and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests STOP 
START to us and to every nation of the free world rich or poor these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security prosperity and peace STOP 
START i believe that the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in UNK the efforts of the developing nations to achieve progress STOP 
START the immediate need for this kind of co-operation is UNK by the strain in this nation's international balance of payments STOP 
START our surplus from foreign business UNK has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military UNK overseas to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the less developed nations STOP 
START in 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached four billion dollars STOP 
START continuing UNK of anything like this magnitude would over time UNK our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world STOP 
START we must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade STOP 
START further we must UNK all UNK nations of the free world to work together to help lift the UNK of poverty from less fortunate STOP 
START this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further increases in mutually profitable trade STOP 
START new nations and others struggling with the problems of development will progress only regardless of any outside help if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and use their own resources to UNK it STOP 
START moreover progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned is no easy and quick way to follow from the UNK to the jet plane STOP 
START but just as we drew on europe for assistance in our earlier years so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith and determination deserve help STOP 
START UNK their need one of the major UNK points of our concern is the UNK region STOP 
START here in two nations alone are almost five hundred million people all working and working hard to raise their standards and in doing so to make of themselves a strong UNK against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty STOP 
START i cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must UNK with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions as expressed in their different UNK plans STOP 
START through the world bank and other UNK as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face this UNK challenge STOP 
START i shall continue to urge the american people in the interests of their own security prosperity and peace to make sure that their own part of this great project be UNK and UNK supported STOP 
START free world decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom STOP 
START other countries some of which i visited last month have similar needs STOP 
START a common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort STOP 
START during the past year i have discussed this matter with the leaders of several western nations STOP 
START because of its wealth of experience the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial studies needed STOP 
START the goal is to UNK all available economic resources in the UNK free world especially private investment capital STOP 
START by extending this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic UNK of these nations under UNK UNK STOP 
START no more startling contrast to a system of UNK UNK could be imagined STOP 
START if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic UNK we will make UNK the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom STOP 
START otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed STOP 
START we face indeed what may be a turning point in history and we must act UNK and UNK STOP 
START as a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of UNK based strength STOP 
START no matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in UNK the issue of arms reduction STOP 
START until tangible and mutually UNK arms reduction measures are worked out we will not UNK the means of defending our institutions STOP 
START america UNK an enormous defense power STOP 
START it is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so UNK support STOP 
START it is world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack the united states by surprise even though we might sustain great losses would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction STOP 
START but i once again assure all peoples and all nations that the united states except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power STOP 
START during the past year our long-range striking power UNK today in manned bombers has taken on new strength as the atlas UNK ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory STOP 
START in fourteen recent test UNK at UNK of five thousand miles atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target STOP 
START this is less than the length of a jet UNK well within the circle of destruction STOP 
START incidentally there was an atlas firing last night STOP 
START from all reports so far received its performance UNK to the high standards i have just described STOP 
START such performance is a great tribute to american scientists and engineers who in the past five years have had to UNK time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles where america had none before STOP 
START this year moreover growing numbers of nuclear UNK submarines will enter our active forces some to be armed with UNK missiles STOP 
START these remarkable ships and weapons ranging the UNK will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth STOP 
START to meet situations of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain our UNK forces our many service units abroad our always ready army strategic forces and marine corps divisions and the civilian components STOP 
START the continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process STOP 
START it is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength STOP 
START the UNK of a portion of these forces beyond our UNK on land and sea is UNK demonstration of our determination to stand UNK with our allies for collective security STOP 
START moreover i have directed that steps be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to these allies STOP 
START this is necessary for a UNK collective defense system STOP 
START next i refer to our program in space exploration which is often UNK supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development STOP 
START we note that first america has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of knowledge of UNK and space science STOP 
START these UNK are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind STOP 
START second our military missile program going forward so successfully does not suffer from our present lack of very large UNK engines which are necessary in distant space exploration STOP 
START i am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements STOP 
START third the united states is pressing forward in the development of large UNK engines to place vehicles of many tons into space for exploration purposes STOP 
START fourth in the meantime it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to UNK the environment immediately surrounding the earth STOP 
START using UNK systems presently available we are developing UNK to UNK the world's weather UNK stations to UNK and extend communications over the globe UNK aids to give accurate UNK to ships and aircraft for UNK instruments to collect and UNK the data we seek STOP 
START fifth we have just completed a year's experience with our new space law STOP 
START i believe it UNK in certain UNK STOP 
START suggested improvements will be submitted to the congress shortly STOP 
START the UNK of the many tasks i have UNK to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual intellectual and economic UNK of american life STOP 
START the steady purpose of our society is to assure justice before god for every individual STOP 
START we must be ever alert that freedom does not UNK through the UNK UNK of UNK controls or the lack of courage to deal UNK with the issues of the day STOP 
START a year ago when i met with you the nation was emerging from an economic UNK even though the signs of UNK prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful STOP 
START today our UNK strength is apparent to everyone STOP 
START 1960 promises to be the most UNK year in our history STOP 
START yet we continue to be UNK by UNK UNK STOP 
START among current problems that require solutions participated in by citizens as well as government are the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged UNK UNK persistent refusal to come to UNK with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture continuing threat of UNK together with the UNK tendency toward fiscal UNK certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law STOP

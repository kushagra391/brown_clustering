START good old UNK cap said STOP 
START you know i've got one of your cars at home STOP 
START as a prominent UNK you ought to be interested in his UNK support group STOP 
START isn't his UNK down your UNK it was william thought STOP 
START but not any more STOP 
START a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap STOP 
START how did he start on such a ride to brief glory enough through the UNK agency of his UNK STOP 
START general UNK draft and doc UNK and cap were responsible for his first UNK but UNK freddy bryan could take credit if he cared to and he did for the second time STOP 
START freddy needed a job having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and UNK financing by UNK and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one STOP 
START mr. willis bought UNK plastic products a UNK corporation of sorts which had UNK many UNK and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy in an executive position STOP 
START shortly after freddy had his usual UNK of bold ideas STOP 
START willis listened UNK and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering generally heard UNK suggestions without interest being absorbed by his own UNK concerns STOP 
START probably mr. willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by UNK loyalty and a concern for his UNK STOP 
START UNK began to aid freddy with her father UNK no doubt by UNK open contempt for freddy and UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START another factor must have been the eventual disposal of UNK fortune unquestionably assumed that the more he was UNK with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy UNK upon his death STOP 
START whatever the reasons willis and bryan started expanding UNK STOP 
START they acquired another electronics factory a specialized UNK company an organization that built very UNK UNK research UNK STOP 
START since they were hunting for national defense contracts adam UNK a man of surprising resources entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections STOP 
START feeling his power freddy looked for additional UNK to UNK STOP 
START heavy industry UNK toward UNK government UNK attracted him STOP 
START the UNK auto company a UNK firm which manufactured UNK vehicles and other UNK equipment had recently constructed an UNK modern plant in a burst of UNK optimism STOP 
START cursed with a UNK management and UNK stockholders it was ripe for UNK and UNK instinct was to keep growing by stock UNK and small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences STOP 
START with UNK UNK he was convinced that UNK wisconsin UNK would be ideal for conversion to airplane UNK tanks missiles or UNK of some kind STOP 
START at that point william came into the picture STOP 
START although not much UNK the account he had been appointed advertising head of UNK STOP 
START freed of routine by having his own firm and a UNK partner his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did he was at least UNK by the chance of wider opportunities STOP 
START mr. willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice beyond the UNK of his field and william set out on a serious study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington STOP 
START in the end he said i'm not UNK by the proposition sir STOP 
START i know a guy named jack UNK a very bright young engineer who was with UNK and i took him with me to UNK STOP 
START it's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind STOP 
START the conversion will cost a fortune STOP 
START besides that i'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force STOP 
START i think adam UNK is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side STOP 
START missiles have thrown everything up for UNK and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here STOP 
START the future of manned aircraft is in doubt which affects government procurement and jet UNK have UNK the UNK trade one jet can take the place of three UNK planes STOP 
START this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough STOP 
START here are a few facts and figures i've assembled STOP 
START can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust UNK glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged STOP 
START well he said there is freddy you know STOP 
START and UNK STOP 
START freddy is deeply committed to our plans already STOP 
START he UNK me he has people to handle the money raising and ham UNK my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding of UNK and UNK are no problem STOP 
START i don't like to exhibit the deadly UNK effect of an elderly man's caution STOP 
START yes i appreciate that STOP 
START i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i'm UNK caused him trouble before and he's beginning to UNK me STOP 
START if we don't take care the sisters will be entering the UNK on opposite sides UNK their UNK STOP 
START which is a UNK prospect bill STOP 
START willis laughed STOP 
START one shouldn't mix commercial affairs with UNK but in this case i have no choice STOP 
START let me think about it STOP 
START i'm most grateful to you so grateful i wish you were my principal UNK instead of freddy STOP 
START not to UNK surprise freddy adam and hamilton UNK UNK to them was UNK UNK much time to UNK her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was UNK to UNK further STOP 
START UNK absorbed UNK stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the UNK combination STOP 
START through jack UNK william fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for UNK and clay STOP 
START he forgot about UNK till UNK he and UNK were proved correct STOP 
START UNK UNK dropped away from him and mr. willis was forced to make up the deficit STOP 
START adam UNK by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation couldn't deliver from his end STOP 
START the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white UNK STOP 
START stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value STOP 
START confronted by a grim future freddy lost his nerve and UNK for a drastic liquidation STOP 
START once more willis UNK william STOP 
START you were right he said you and your engineer and i'm in something of a UNK STOP 
START UNK solution doesn't appeal to me STOP 
START in addition to other defects i'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment STOP 
START will you see if you can help me spent a long week end UNK with UNK STOP 
START his recent experience in motor car advertising a love for cars of themselves the existence of UNK useless wisconsin UNK exposure to exciting UNK of UNK that nobody would buy and the UNK recent failure of a respected but UNK UNK manufacturer called UNK motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to UNK it STOP 
START initially UNK reaction to UNK going into the passenger car market was UNK STOP 
START he thought the financing the advertising the production of new models the founding of a UNK chain of UNK was simply too difficult STOP 
START then he caught fire STOP 
START if UNK could buy UNK UNK and use their UNK and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money UNK was not UNK STOP 
START they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put their arguments down in black and white STOP 
START taking UNK with him william went to mr. willis STOP 
START he was surprised and UNK but impressed by the engineer and the report STOP 
START your alternative is UNK he said and i'm frank in saying a bit mad STOP 
START i wish i was younger and less UNK STOP 
START well i can't resolve this myself STOP 
START i'll have to call in the brain trust STOP 
START are you willing to run the UNK can't UNK you a sympathetic audience STOP 
START we'll be in there swinging william said but in a way sir you've got to decide it yourself STOP 
START you have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours and besides nobody else is going to have the courage STOP 
START if they follow anyone it'll have to be you STOP 
START he paused STOP 
START i should explain there's more here for me than UNK my little dream there's you STOP 
START you UNK take a fall or publicly back away STOP 
START i hate that STOP 
START you're you're arthur willis STOP 
START forgive the hearts and flowers theme STOP 
START i rather like the music willis replied quietly STOP 
START thank you STOP 
START at the meeting attended by freddy UNK UNK and the UNK executive staff with mr. willis UNK william and UNK did indeed run the UNK STOP 
START from shock and UNK most of the listeners went on to open resistance and UNK STOP 
START oh my god ham UNK said a little child shall lead them STOP 
START move over general motors STOP 
START it's absurd bill freddy said from a pale face STOP 
START you're leading dad down the garden path STOP 
START your garden god damn it said STOP

START we're here to UNK business STOP 
START can't we put an end to this arthur hear me out please william begged STOP 
START i'm an advertising UNK i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere STOP 
START sure UNK went broke in the UNK market UNK the big three STOP 
START their cars weren't small enough they didn't have the power they were UNK STOP 
START they tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit STOP 
START we've arrived at an age for romance and UNK STOP 
START we've all been rich and UNK long enough to hate the machine age STOP 
START look what those little european jobs are doing STOP 
START we'll UNK the consumer with a product not UNK him with UNK excess length and weight STOP 
START let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a UNK at reasonable rates STOP

START why not come down UNK in the world in a UNK fashion with an UNK UNK them somewhat but the debate UNK on STOP

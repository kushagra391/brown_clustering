START some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote UNK past nowadays all UNK are thoroughly familiar with the best UNK and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and UNK out of the situation STOP 
START perhaps but extensive discussions with contemporary UNK family doctors and UNK indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance STOP 
START UNK and talking may be UNK and easier but the important UNK information is still lacking for far too many UNK men and women STOP 
START various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first UNK a good rather than a bad memory for one or both STOP 
START privacy must be highly assured both in time and place STOP 
START that is locking the room or UNK door gives privacy of location but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly UNK fulfillment STOP 
START if the wedding party lasted late and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before UNK the trip or making an early start the husband may UNK tensions and UNK by UNK to his bride that lying in each UNK arms will be UNK enough for these few hours STOP 
START the UNK should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time day or night for that purpose STOP 
START first UNK for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with UNK and the hymen STOP 
START one thing should be clear to both husband and wife neither pain nor UNK bleeding has to occur when the hymen is UNK during the first sex act STOP 
START ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding and suspicion STOP 
START the hymen is in essence a UNK UNK that more or less completely covers the entrance to the UNK in most female human beings who have not had sex relations STOP 
START hymen in fact is the greek word for UNK STOP 
START often it is thin and UNK and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at UNK STOP 
START as might be expected girls in this situation UNK very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their UNK STOP 
START it is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations STOP 
START but there is a basis in fact for the UNK of the UNK beliefs STOP 
START some UNK are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood STOP 
START more rarely the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration STOP 
START extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit UNK relations to be UNK STOP 
START these cases for all their UNK are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to UNK STOP 
START in recent times when sexual matters began to be discussed more UNK and more openly the emotional aspects of UNK received considerable attention STOP 
START obviously the UNK pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation STOP 
START is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride and marriage UNK began to UNK that the bride should consult a physician before marriage STOP 
START if he UNK any problem because of the quality of the hymen it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to UNK the hymen or preferably to UNK it STOP 
START as a natural UNK of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for UNK UNK by UNK the UNK STOP 
START this recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only UNK to smooth UNK of the sex act STOP 
START the UNK is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and UNK STOP 
START this is obvious when it is remembered that during UNK the UNK must UNK enough to permit the passage of the baby STOP 
START the UNK system of muscles that manage the contraction and UNK of the UNK are partly under voluntary control STOP 
START but an UNK UNK may work against the conscious intention of the woman STOP 
START that is when first penetration takes place the pressure and pain signals may UNK cause all the UNK muscles to contract in an effort to bar the UNK and prevent further pain STOP 
START the advantages of UNK by the physician are both physical and psychological STOP 
START since it is a purely professional situation none of the pain is associated with UNK or the beloved STOP 
START by using instruments of gradually increasing size the UNK is gently and with minimum pain at each stage taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape STOP 
START in this process the UNK muscles come under better conscious control by the girl STOP 
START she UNK how to relax them to accept instead of UNK them to UNK the entering object STOP 
START apart from the standard problem of controlling the UNK muscles other serious barriers may exist that need special UNK treatment STOP 
START it is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation STOP 
START when no medical problems exist the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves STOP 
START special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value STOP 
START UNK UNK and remembered passages from UNK literature can create physical and emotional problems if UNK taken as scientific facts and useful UNK STOP 
START the importance of loving UNK is obvious STOP 
START the long UNK approach and the deliberate UNK of UNK work on several levels STOP 
START under the excitement of UNK and sexual stimulation the UNK UNK and UNK and the local UNK greatly increases providing an excellent UNK to help achieve an easier penetration STOP 
START extensive observations by UNK during UNK UNK have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the UNK wall the top line of the UNK as the woman lies on her back may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin STOP 
START but during the same examination two fingers may be inserted along the UNK wall the bottom of the UNK in the same position without any pain in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times STOP 
START these regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest UNK STOP 
START the husband and wife should start with this UNK information clearly in mind STOP 
START they may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the UNK and the UNK wall of the UNK least until repeated UNK has UNK it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of UNK STOP 
START in fact the technical procedure in medical UNK may be UNK adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon STOP 
START UNK talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is UNK and UNK during the first penetration STOP 
START the false reasoning is that a gradual advance UNK the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his UNK and grateful for his UNK in settling the problem once and for all STOP 
START such talk is seriously in error STOP 
START UNK at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride both physically and UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK penetration may tear and UNK the UNK walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen STOP 
START the pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a UNK UNK of UNK relations and cause her UNK to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by UNK her UNK muscles to UNK his penetration instead of UNK them to UNK it STOP 
START serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation STOP 
START the necessity for keeping alert to his UNK UNK can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire STOP 
START the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a UNK climax STOP 
START this is a very common experience and should in no way UNK or UNK either husband or wife STOP 
START or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the UNK pace of the UNK can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period STOP 
START the signals to proceed may therefore come when he is UNK not able to take advantage of them STOP 
START the best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again STOP 
START this may require imagination and UNK himself that now he can be demanding and UNK STOP 
START he can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost STOP 
START now while he uses talk UNK or requires UNK from her his bride will UNK understand the situation and eagerly help him UNK his physical situation so they can have the UNK they both so eagerly desire STOP 
START a final word STOP 
START the UNK information on this point shows that first UNK even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman STOP 
START too many new things are happening for it to be a complete UNK fulfillment STOP 
START only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an UNK during her first UNK STOP 
START both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or UNK STOP 
START if the early approaches are wise understanding and patient the UNK of UNK fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older STOP 
START writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and UNK titled the nude a study in ideal form UNK clark declares the human body as a nucleus is rich in associations STOP 
START it is ourselves and UNK memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves STOP 
START perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions attitudes and emotions UNK by the nude form STOP 
START the wide UNK of reactions is clearly illustrated in the UNK studies in human UNK STOP 
START differences were related to social economic and educational UNK STOP 
START whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by UNK those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved UNK in sexual relations STOP 
START such understanding helps to explain why one UNK UNK thirty-five years of married life could UNK with some pride that her husband had never seen her entirely naked while another woman UNK an equal number of years of married life is proud of having shared the UNK way of life the really free natural nude life for most of that period STOP 
START attempts at UNK always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions STOP 
START the UNK UNK sees the nude or UNK human form as UNK and UNK a threat and danger to all the young or good or religious or moral persons STOP 
START the equally ardent UNK of freedom from any kind of UNK may find the nude human form the natural honest free expression of man's spirit and the UNK of beauty and UNK STOP 
START one is always a little surprised to UNK into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected STOP 
START i still recall the mild shock i experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the clean UNK free way of natural life in UNK who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and UNK in fine spirit STOP

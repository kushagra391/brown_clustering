START miami UNK march 17 STOP 
START UNK UNK writer came up to paul UNK today and asked the UNK manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year STOP 
START now UNK of course is known as a deep UNK as baseball managers go STOP 
START he can often make the complex UNK simple and vice UNK STOP 
START this happened to be vice UNK but even so the answer was a UNK STOP 
START it's a whole lot easier he said to increase the population of UNK than it is to increase the population of new york city STOP 
START and with that he walked off to give instruction to a UNK pitcher STOP 
START that is undoubtedly a hell of a quote said the writer scratching his head STOP 
START now if i can just figure out what he's talking about i'll use it STOP 
START two spots open this was just UNK way of saying that last year the birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open STOP 
START some brilliant UNK nailed them down so that this spring just two spots left and right field are really up for UNK STOP 
START it should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the UNK lots that were open last year but so far it hasn't worked that way STOP 
START this angle of just where the orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one STOP 
START you'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring but there remains a feeling among some around here that the orioles still have a chance to battle for the UNK in 1961 STOP 
START obviously if this club is going to move from second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement UNK STOP 
START where can that improvement possibly come from certainly can't expect the UNK to do any better than it did last year STOP 
START UNK could be better STOP 
START UNK robinson is great and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960 STOP 
START you can't expect it though STOP 
START UNK performance last year was tremendous STOP 
START it's the same with UNK UNK and jim gentile STOP 
START if they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint STOP 
START they shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden STOP 
START UNK will be getting a late spring training start which might very well set him back STOP 
START he got off to an exceptional start last season and under the circumstances probably won't UNK it STOP 
START there are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year STOP 
START they don't expect to stop him just slow him down some with the bat STOP 
START he'll still be a top player they UNK because he's got a great UNK and the long ball going for him STOP 
START but they expect to reduce his over-all UNK production STOP 
START UNK might move up STOP 
START gentile can hardly do better than drive in UNK runs STOP 
START don't ask him more STOP 
START i have a UNK UNK UNK might move up a UNK STOP 
START but even so he had a good year in 1960 and won't do too much better STOP 
START so all in all the UNK can't be expected to supply the added improvement to UNK the birds from second to first STOP 
START and the pitching will also have trouble doing better STOP 
START UNK got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season STOP 
START where then can we look for improvement from UNK UNK and walker answers UNK STOP 
START they're the ones we can expect to do better STOP 
START the man is right and at this time indications are that these three are ready for better seasons STOP 
START UNK hasn't proved it yet but he says he's convinced his UNK is all right STOP 
START he UNK it this spring and has had to rest it but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him STOP 
START if he can UNK back with one of those 25 home runs years the club will have to be better off UNK STOP 
START i'm still not convinced though i'll have to see more of him before UNK that big year for him STOP 
START hank UNK backed up by frank house who will be within calling distance in the UNK make up better second line UNK than the birds had all last year but UNK is still that big man you need when you start talking UNK STOP 
START to me UNK looks as though he could be in for a fine year STOP 
START he hasn't played too much because UNK has been working on him furiously in batting practice STOP 
START he's hitting the ball hard in the batting UNK and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year STOP 
START when he came to baltimore he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the national league UNK and he was joining what seemed to be a second division american league club STOP 
START he was down hard to talk to and far too UNK on the field STOP 
START as of now that all seems behind him STOP 
START he's been entirely different all spring STOP 
START and walker looks stronger seems to be throwing better than he did last year STOP 
START let him UNK back and he could really set up the staff STOP 
START so if the orioles are to improve UNK UNK and walker will have to do it STOP 
START so far the UNK on left and right UNK don't seem capable of carrying the load STOP 
START of course this isn't taking into consideration the population of UNK and new york city but it's the way things look from here at this point STOP 
START is the mother of an autistic child at fault the autistic child is one who seems to lack a UNK sense of self STOP 
START he tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people STOP 
START did his mother make him this way people believe she did STOP 
START we think differently STOP 
START we believe that UNK like so many other conditions of UNK and deviation is to a large extent UNK STOP 
START a mother can help a child UNK to his difficulties STOP 
START sometimes she can to a large extent help him overcome them STOP 
START but we don't think she creates them STOP 
START we don't think she can make her child UNK emotionally disturbed or autistic STOP 
START the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often by sharing her experiences she can help other mothers with the same problem STOP 
START since little is known about UNK and almost nothing has been written for the UNK we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments STOP 
START she wrote total UNK STOP 
START as the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything i have to UNK my UNK fingers for him when he first plays with a new UNK STOP 
START he wants me to do everything for him STOP 
START you don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them STOP 
START but i do and my UNK does too STOP 
START i know that my son wants control and direction but being autistic myself i cannot give full control or direction STOP 
START one thing i notice which i have seldom heard mentioned STOP 
START this is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others for instance my children and i STOP 
START when i hold my son he UNK his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board STOP 
START he UNK and UNK himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held STOP 
START physical contact is uncomfortable for him mother is quite correct STOP 
START as a rule the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others STOP 
START parents have to find other ways of UNK him STOP 
START for the young child this may be no more than providing food light or movement STOP 
START as he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object his magic thing STOP 
START or certain words or UNK that child and adult go through may do the trick STOP 
START the answer is different for each autistic child but for most there is an answer STOP 
START only UNK will UNK it STOP 
START what future holds dear doctors we learned this year that our older son daniel is autistic STOP 
START we did not accept the diagnosis at once but gradually we are coming to STOP 
START fortunately there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend with a group of normal children STOP 
START i try to treat daniel as if he were normal though of course i realize he is far from that at present STOP 
START what i do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible STOP 
START i try to give him as many normal experiences as possible STOP 
START what is your experience with autistic children do they turn out later autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives STOP 
START certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people but many adjust to school even college to jobs and even to marriage and UNK STOP 
START UNK use question a first UNK colors pictures one solid color everything sky grass boy wagon etc. STOP 
START when different colors are used she is just as likely to color trees purple hair green etc. STOP 
START the other children in the class use this same UNK book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color STOP 
START should i show my daughter how things should be colored is an aggressive nervous child STOP 
START is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her UNK these UNK her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of UNK without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects STOP 
START this UNK use of UNK may suggest that she is a little UNK for the first grade STOP 
START no UNK isn't exactly something you teach a child STOP 
START you sometimes give them a little demonstration a little guidance and suggestions about staying inside the lines STOP 
START but most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration STOP 
START seen in UNK circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art UNK STOP 
START possibly responsible for this is the UNK trend toward UNK UNK in rooms which seems UNK to replace the UNK look to which we have been accustomed STOP 
START just as a UNK oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme so may some of the newest UNK of UNK STOP 
START one such in fact is a rug STOP 
START though not actually UNK UNK it has that look with its UNK raised pattern in blue pink bronze and gold and a UNK background STOP 
START the UNK UNK design of UNK stems and UNK forms strongly suggests the UNK patterns used so UNK for UNK during the UNK period in england STOP 
START traditional UNK UNK which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country STOP 
START the work is executed in england by hand and can be worked in any desired design and color STOP 
START among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were UNK UNK plates UNK with UNK and UNK and another set on which a UNK was worked in UNK color STOP 
START chinese influence for a particularly UNK room which houses a collection of fine english UNK furniture fabric wall panels were UNK with a typically UNK design of this UNK eighteenth century period STOP 
START since the work is done by hand the only UNK it is said is that of human conception STOP 
START modern UNK panels framed and meant to be hung on the wall are another aspect of this trend STOP 
START these have never gone out of style in UNK homes and now seem to be UNK here and there in shops which UNK in UNK STOP 
START an amateur UNK might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings and by picking up her living room color scheme add a UNK UNK note to the room STOP

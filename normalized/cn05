START she was carrying a UNK and she started to raise it then let it fall again and UNK from her UNK STOP 
START i saw your fire she said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger STOP 
START you could burn down this whole UNK with a fire that size STOP 
START it wouldn't matter to a fool like you STOP 
START it would to me STOP 
START all right wilson said quickly STOP 
START the UNK too big STOP 
START and i appreciate the advice STOP 
START he was losing patience again STOP 
START an hour before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness he would have appreciated company STOP 
START she had helped him change his mind STOP 
START i'm not UNK you she said STOP 
START i'm telling you STOP 
START that UNK too big STOP 
START let it burn down STOP 
START and make sure it's out when you leave in the morning STOP 
START he was taken UNK STOP 
START it took him a long time to UNK himself STOP 
START there's some mistake he said finally STOP 
START you're right about the fire STOP 
START it's bigger than it has to be though i don't see where it's doing any harm STOP 
START but you're wrong about the rest of it STOP 
START i'm not leaving in the morning STOP 
START why should i own the place STOP 
START she showed her surprise by UNK the UNK and moving the UNK around so that she could get a better look at his face STOP 
START it didn't seem to tell her anything STOP 
START she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and UNK scattered over the ground the two kids the UNK bull that was chewing its UNK just within the far reaches of the UNK STOP 
START she studied it for a long time STOP 
START then she turned back to wilson and smiled and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it STOP 
START you own this place said and her tone had UNK until it was almost friendly STOP 
START you bought it from a man in st. louis wilson said STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START maybe you know him STOP 
START the girl laughed STOP 
START i know him STOP 
START i ought to STOP 
START my father ran him off here six years ago STOP 
START wilson didn't say anything STOP 
START he stood watching the girl wondering what was coming next STOP 
START she had picked up the UNK and was UNK it around her UNK and smiling at him STOP 
START UNK didn't tell you that she said STOP 
START no wilson said STOP 
START but it's understandable STOP 
START it's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of STOP 
START and it doesn't make any difference STOP 
START he sold me a clear title STOP 
START i have it with me right here STOP 
START if you want to see never mind she said UNK STOP 
START it wouldn't matter to my father and not to me STOP 
START i meant what i said about that fire STOP 
START be sure it's out when you leave STOP 
START that's all STOP 
START i'll let you go back to doing the dishes now STOP 
START it was meant to UNK him and didn't quite succeed STOP 
START he took the UNK just below the bit and held them firmly and it was his turn to smile now STOP 
START i don't mind washing dishes now and then he said UNK STOP 
START it doesn't hurt STOP 
START it might hurt you though STOP 
START somebody might mistake you for a woman STOP 
START he meant to say more but he never got the chance STOP 
START she was quick STOP 
START she brought the UNK down UNK it across his cheek and he tried to step back STOP 
START she swung the UNK again and this time he caught her UNK and pulled her out of the saddle STOP 
START she came down against him and he tried to break her fall STOP 
START he grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him STOP 
START it made him a little sick and he let go of her STOP 
START he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood facing her STOP 
START he wiped the blood from his cheek STOP 
START i ought to he said STOP 
START he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful UNK STOP 
START that UNK i ought to use it on you where it would do the most good STOP 
START if you were a man she isn't UNK STOP 
START the voice came from behind him and wilson turned STOP 
START the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the trees STOP 
START but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light and wilson had a good look at him STOP 
START he was tall and UNK a UNK wilson thought STOP 
START and he was handsome despite the long thin UNK that UNK across his cheek STOP 
START she's not a man UNK he said STOP 
START i am STOP 
START if you've got any ideas STOP 
START he raised the winchester and pointed it at UNK chest STOP 
START put the rifle down joseph the girl said STOP 
START she seemed UNK STOP 
START i thought i told you to stay home STOP 
START the UNK UNK the winchester down and rested it across his lap STOP 
START the UNK looked pure white in the UNK eyes were black and UNK and UNK STOP 
START you shouldn't be riding up here after dark UNK he said quietly STOP 
START i can take care of this STOP 
START it's no job for you STOP 
START the girl UNK the UNK UNK against her knee and UNK at him STOP 
START he took it without UNK STOP 
START i said go home joseph STOP 
START you've got no business up here STOP 
START the UNK didn't answer this time STOP 
START but the UNK seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry STOP 
START it made wilson wonder STOP 
START he watched the UNK as he turned silently STOP 
START they could hear the UNK feet on the dry leaves for a while then the sound faded out STOP 
START wilson brushed the dust from his coat STOP 
START who was that asked STOP 
START your personal guard pretty hard on him STOP 
START he works for my father the girl said and then seemed to change her mind STOP 
START he's a friend STOP 
START his UNK joseph UNK STOP 
START is there anything else you want to know not now wilson said STOP 
START i guess i'll find out soon enough STOP 
START you've got blood on your cheek STOP 
START not yours STOP 
START mine STOP 
START it must have got there when you fell against me STOP 
START she wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat STOP 
START i'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby wilson said STOP 
START he saw her hand start to work down the leather UNK toward the handle of the UNK and he grabbed her UNK STOP 
START oh no he said and he was without humor now STOP 
START i've had enough of that STOP 
START i've had enough of you STOP 
START i don't know what goes on around here and i don't care STOP 
START i don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business and i don't care about that either STOP 
START you took me by surprise STOP 
START but i'll know how to handle you next time STOP 
START she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was UNK STOP 
START he UNK her blow and she fell UNK against the UNK STOP 
START she finally UNK her balance and got up in the saddle STOP 
START her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before STOP 
START he had forgotten that she was so pretty STOP 
START but her UNK was what he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward cruelty UNK UNK STOP 
START he had known women like that one woman in particular STOP 
START and one had been too many STOP 
START he watched the girl until she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were sleeping STOP 
START they weren't sleeping of course but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending STOP 
START he hadn't shown up too well in their eyes letting himself be UNK by a woman STOP 
START they expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances and they were disappointed STOP 
START and determined not to show it STOP 
START they lay a little too UNK with their eyes UNK to stay closed STOP 
START go to sleep he said STOP 
START both of you STOP 
START there's better things to do than listen to something like that STOP 
START i'll be down at the creek UNK the dishes if you want me STOP 
START he found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream STOP 
START the UNK was calling again and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to UNK it STOP 
START not tonight at any rate STOP 
START he had a feeling that the girl meant trouble STOP 
START if she did he could stand it better in the light STOP 
START he UNK UNK at the UNK and reflected on how things had turned out STOP 
START that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the UNK ranch house his hopes had been high STOP 
START already some of the pain had gone from UNK death STOP 
START not all of it STOP 
START there would still be plenty of moments of UNK and UNK and guilty relief STOP 
START but they were starting a new life STOP 
START and they had almost everything they needed land a house two UNK UNK three horses STOP 
START the land wasn't all wilson had expected of it STOP 
START six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st. louis had said grass good water STOP 
START well the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it STOP 
START the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead UNK STOP 
START and there was a house perhaps but badly in need of UNK STOP 
START in the last analysis though wilson had little cause to complain STOP 
START the place had been cheap just the little he had left after UNK burial and it would serve its purpose STOP 
START there was only one place where UNK UNK description had gone badly UNK the peace and quiet STOP 
START it hadn't started out that way STOP 
START and he had a feeling thanks to the girl that things would get worse before they got better STOP 
START 2 they had the house cleaned up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses STOP 
START he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy UNK and finally went over to help him STOP 
START UNK was already in the wagon STOP 
START they were going to town and they were both excited STOP 
START wilson backed the team into the UNK and wished they weren't going to town at all STOP 
START he had an uneasy feeling about it STOP 
START that girl last night what was her name UNK STOP 
START it was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember STOP 
START he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him STOP 
START he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it was even less UNK than UNK UNK had made it seem STOP 
START there was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow under and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to UNK STOP 
START but there was water STOP 
START there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that UNK out of the ground above the UNK UNK STOP 
START yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble STOP 
START there were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres STOP 
START the first part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley STOP 
START it was UNK once they reached the flat and UNK but the grass was better STOP 
START a warm breeze played across it moving it like waves STOP 
START a UNK hawk flew in behind them and stayed there watching for any snakes or UNK that they might UNK up from the side of the road STOP 
START it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of UNK STOP 
START the town was about what wilson expected one main street with its rows of UNK buildings a water tower a few UNK a single hotel dusty and UNK STOP 
START the place was quiet STOP

START martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all STOP 
START and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions STOP 
START the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life STOP 
START lying awake at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind STOP 
START when he rose in the morning the image was still there STOP 
START he had always been a UNK and UNK man STOP 
START in his UNK days his bedroom had been UNK with clothes which his mother or later the hotel maid generally saw fit to put in order STOP 
START no doubt dolores UNK following in their UNK STOP 
START but it was fun those first days UNK about the trail of UNK he left UNK across the rug STOP 
START there was an UNK UNK in his UNK refusal to pick them up STOP 
START half UNK he enjoyed seeing her UNK to lift the things STOP 
START he remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party STOP 
START the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled against it like UNK STOP 
START her hair was the color of those UNK which in seed UNK are referred to as black but since no flower is actually without color contain always a UNK of UNK or purple or blue he wanted to draw the broad UNK of hair through his fingers searching it slowly for a trace of UNK which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness STOP 
START so he sought her out and spoke to her and thought of his hand in her hair STOP 
START or against her back pressed on the column of UNK which held her so UNK straight and UNK until the UNK of bone made tiny sharp cracking UNK like the snapped stem of a UNK STOP 
START but to put it UNK nothing snapped STOP 
START yet that had not seriously troubled him not then STOP 
START they married STOP 
START more he could take at leisure STOP 
START all martin thought he needed was time to what better use could time be put saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly STOP 
START there was too little occasion UNK for resistance the brave strong UNK of emotional UNK and meeting STOP 
START they had left themselves too much to discover STOP 
START but at the start his new life felt UNK STOP 
START good STOP 
START it was on the UNK day after the wedding how could it have been so soon that he dropped the shorts on the floor STOP 
START now i'm not going to pick up those shorts gave her a UNK pat STOP 
START i think you'll get tired of them there STOP 
START in the morning the shorts were where he had left them STOP 
START he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till dolores did STOP 
START it was almost too easy STOP 
START for he had just remembered tonight they were having their first guests STOP 
START the shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening STOP 
START he was wrong STOP 
START the rest of the bedroom had been UNK to a UNK UNK but in the middle of the carpet lay the UNK shorts STOP 
START they gave the room a strange note of UNK like a UNK on a beautiful face STOP 
START he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking he would get nervous STOP 
START quietly he determined to foil her STOP 
START i can be as stubborn as she can he thought nerves are as strong STOP 
START UNK rush to the bedroom when the UNK UNK STOP 
START it rang STOP 
START ten minutes early STOP 
START martin was standing a few feet from the front door STOP 
START he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away STOP 
START dolores stood UNK in the doorway STOP 
START he could not cross the living room brush past her and bend down to UNK the shorts STOP 
START martin turned his back STOP 
START he UNK to answer the bell STOP 
START UNK hat was UNK in the hall closet STOP 
START with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led UNK to the bedroom STOP 
START martin strained his ears STOP 
START at first he could not be sure STOP 
START then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there STOP 
START a UNK of UNK slid over their voices STOP 
START all evening UNK favored him with odd UNK looks STOP 
START clearly she had been instructed not to say a word STOP 
START for some reason this UNK in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other UNK STOP 
START at last there was a UNK no one could fill STOP 
START the UNK went home early STOP 
START martin realized later on that he should have had it out with dolores that night STOP 
START as violently as possible STOP 
START but he was so taken UNK he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in STOP 
START on the contrary it would only UNK his position if he UNK while she stayed calm and UNK STOP 
START and if he UNK after UNK at her STOP 
START he UNK STOP 
START suppose he ran up the white flag altogether once STOP 
START he considered the sober possibility STOP 
START in his head was the UNK of those UNK with UNK STOP 
START there was something about private UNK UNK which always made him feel UNK and UNK STOP 
START he remembered his mother UNK with her neighborhood women friends UNK her voice to a penetrating UNK which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs where he crouched listening STOP 
START he could even recall the last time he sat there STOP 
START she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry STOP 
START he UNK so UNK i couldn't keep being UNK with him STOP 
START it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened which was as honest as he could put it STOP 
START but his mother told the story over and over till her martin said he was sorry was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin UNK ears STOP 
START the battle had to be fought STOP 
START let the best sex win STOP 
START but his resolution hardly seemed to help STOP 
START if the situation had been bad it now got worse STOP 
START about this time people began dropping in considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough STOP 
START UNK martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip preferably one that lasted months instead of deciding not to UNK the date until he could get away STOP 
START here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by STOP 
START these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment STOP 
START of course the UNK of inspection included the UNK shorts STOP 
START it was curious how the different visitors took this STOP 
START some tried to ignore the UNK on the UNK UNK STOP 
START others asked STOP 
START quite a few laughed STOP 
START to them all dolores told a UNK and UNK tale STOP 
START it's a little contest martin and i have she would begin UNK carrying the UNK through a UNK and UNK course STOP 
START while he waited in the living room STOP 
START once martin went along STOP 
START they entered the bedroom and dolores said nothing STOP 
START then one of the guests showed his UNK STOP 
START you were in a hurry weren't you would have liked to break the man's neck STOP 
START dolores smiled let the interpretation stand STOP 
START now martin heard himself give a UNK of UNK good nature STOP 
START with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to begin it's a little contest never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment STOP 
START they kept up a rigid UNK of speaking relations STOP 
START but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything STOP 
START what to talk about kept picking up any of his clothes except the fatal shorts which he left about but he had been UNK of pleasure in UNK his possessions STOP 
START he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in UNK and UNK so his life might UNK as little as possible on hers STOP 
START the shorts alone remained STOP 
START in his moments of worst UNK martin imagined what his friends were saying STOP 
START the sound of their UNK STOP 
START UNK he could hear the word STOP 
START the most UNK situation STOP 
START we were up to visit them and he had thought her exactly what he wanted STOP 
START six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense he told himself furiously STOP 
START UNK his idea he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now STOP 
START everyone would know why would cut a UNK ridiculous figure STOP 
START he was UNK STOP 
START day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself STOP 
START his mind UNK UNK seeking an UNK STOP 
START UNK he had periods of hostile UNK in which he determined UNK UNK to live out his life in this fashion STOP 
START nothing would change nothing would ever change STOP 
START when the solution finally came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before STOP 
START in a UNK of excitement he considered his plan STOP 
START beside his shorts he would place something of hers STOP 
START UNK he would have won an UNK moral victory for if she picked up say a pair of her UNK she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside the expenditure of energy was almost the same STOP 
START he felt that it would be a particular UNK to dolores to pick up her own UNK which he had laid on the floor STOP 
START furthermore he could go on UNK the UNK UNK every time he went in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a UNK or maybe a UNK next to his shorts STOP 
START sooner or later dolores would crack STOP 
START on the other hand if she didn't remove her own things it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which UNK the apartment STOP 
START martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next UNK of her story STOP 
START the tale he thought would become less gay STOP 
START she had used his UNK shorts as the very image of his UNK his lack of control his general male UNK while she remained cool UNK and UNK the charming teacher who disciplined an UNK body STOP 
START to have her UNK linked with his on the floor would draw her UNK into a struggle both bitter and absurd STOP 
START something in the back of his mind was aware that the UNK of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed in it since his courage and UNK were involved because it was truly his STOP 
START the knowledge kept him from UNK his scheme to death and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of UNK UNK STOP 
START the next morning while dolores was out of the room he went to her bureau UNK took out a pair of UNK UNK UNK and UNK dropped them next to his shorts STOP 
START he sat down on the bed STOP 
START in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared STOP 
START to his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two UNK STOP 
START slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the UNK with her fingers then hesitated for about a second STOP 
START ah he thought she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too STOP 
START he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him STOP 
START extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly left the room STOP 
START she did not look at him but he noticed that her face was UNK and her eyes UNK STOP 
START they UNK together but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen UNK up and down from the table so that talk was impossible STOP 
START well martin thought UNK save STOP 
START he left for work in high spirits STOP 
START as he relaxed that day martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks STOP 
START he found that he no longer hated dolores he knew how much he had hated her and he was surprised at a UNK of an UNK feeling STOP

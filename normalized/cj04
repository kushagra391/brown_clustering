START a UNK magnetic resonance study of UNK af as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented STOP 
START af is paramagnetic and electron paramagnetic UNK as well as nuclear UNK effects lead to line UNK STOP 
START the lines are UNK and over the range of field af UNK and temperature af the UNK increases with increasing af and UNK t STOP 
START an UNK resonance shift of af to lower applied fields indicates a weak UNK UNK contact interaction STOP 
START the general theory of resonance shifts is used to derive a general expression for the second moment af of a UNK paramagnetic sample and is specialized to af STOP 
START the theory UNK a linear dependence of af on af where UNK is the UNK determined UNK constant STOP 
START the experimental second moment af UNK to the relation af in agreement with theory STOP 
START hence the electron paramagnetic effects slope can be separated from the nuclear effects UNK STOP 
START the paramagnetic UNK effects provide some information on the particle shapes STOP 
START the nuclear UNK effects provide some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei but the UNK of the af bond in af remains in doubt STOP 
START introduction the magnetic moment of an UNK electron associated nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei STOP 
START it is important to consider and UNK UNK this influence since UNK nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations of structure STOP 
START af appeared to be well suited for the study of these matters since it is a normal UNK with three UNK electrons on the UNK its crystal structure is very simple and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong af bond provides structural interest STOP 
START we first discuss the af bond in af STOP 
START we then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic UNK with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment STOP 
START indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effects STOP 
START the information provided by the electron paramagnetic effects is then discussed and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted in terms of various UNK models of the af bond in af STOP 
START af bond in af theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the af bond will be linear in the absence of UNK of packing in the solid STOP 
START moreover it will be UNK until a certain critical af distance is reached below which it will become UNK STOP 
START there is ample evidence from many sources that the af bond in af is UNK STOP 
START the af distance in af is UNK aj STOP 
START there is evidence though less convincing than for af that the af bond in UNK UNK is UNK STOP 
START here the af distance is UNK aj STOP 
START a number of UNK estimates by various workers lead to the conclusion that the af bond becomes UNK when the af bond length is about UNK to UNK a but aside from the possible example of UNK UNK there have been no convincing reports of UNK af bonds STOP 
START UNK has studied the crystal structure of af by x-ray UNK STOP 
START he finds the structure contains an af bond with the af distance of af STOP 
START there is then the possibility that this af bond is UNK although UNK was unable to determine its UNK from his x-ray data STOP 
START UNK found af to be UNK UNK UNK af with af af STOP 
START x-ray and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell corresponding to a paramagnetic UNK density of af STOP 
START the x-ray data did not permit UNK to determine UNK the space group but a negative test for UNK led him to assume a center of UNK STOP 
START under this assumption the space group must be af and the following are the positions of the atoms in the unit cell STOP 
START af STOP 
START this space group requires the hydrogen bond to be UNK STOP 
START UNK found powder intensity UNK and measurements to agree best for af STOP 
START these data lead to a structure in which sheets of UNK atoms lie between two sheets of o atoms STOP 
START the o atoms in each sheet are close packed and each UNK atom is surrounded by a distorted UNK of o atoms STOP 
START the af UNK are UNK normal to the UNK axis with the lower UNK of one layer directly above the upper UNK of the neighboring lower layer in such a manner that the repeat is every three UNK STOP 
START the separate UNK are joined together by hydrogen bonds STOP 
START a drawing of the structure is to be found in reference 6 STOP 
START the gross details of the structure appear reasonable STOP 
START the structure appears to be unique among UNK compounds but is the same as that assumed by af STOP 
START the bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits and the volume per oxygen is about normal STOP 
START however the possible absence of a center of UNK not only moves the hydrogen atom off af but also allows the oxygen atoms to become UNK with af at af and af at af space group af where af represents the UNK on one side of the af UNK and af those on the other side STOP 
START however any oxygen UNK would UNK either the already extremely short af UNK distance of UNK a or the UNK af UNK UNK which are already quite short at UNK aj STOP 
START hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from UNK UNK STOP 
START the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atoms to occupy general rather than special positions along the UNK axis STOP 
START if the af bond is linear then there are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms 1 the hydrogen atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet UNK between the oxygen sheets 2 all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet but the sheet is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other 3 hydrogen atoms are UNK placed either UNK or in an ordered way so that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others are closer to the lower oxygen atoms STOP 
START position 2 appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence of a UNK effect and on general chemical structural grounds STOP 
START a UNK of UNK and UNK is more likely than ordered UNK and UNK in position 3 since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also since ordered up and down implies a larger unit cell for which no evidence exists STOP 
START therefore the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located UNK 1 or UNK 3 STOP 
START experimental procedures samples UNK prepared his sample of af by thermal decomposition of aqueous UNK acid at 300 UNK STOP 
START dr. UNK was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams of his material STOP 
START this material proved to be UNK since we could not obtain UNK results on various portions of the sample STOP 
START subsequently we learned from UNK that his sample contained a few percent af UNK STOP 
START since af is UNK we felt that any results obtained from the UNK UNK af would be suspect STOP 
START plane suggested another preparation of af which we used here STOP 
START 500 ml of UNK aqueous af with 1 af added are heated in a bomb at UNK for UNK hours STOP 
START a very fine gray solid about 15 g is formed UNK by UNK and dried at UNK STOP 
START differential thermal analysis showed a very small UNK reaction at UNK and a large UNK reaction at UNK STOP 
START this latter reaction is in UNK with the reported decomposition of af STOP 
START UNK analysis showed a weight loss of UNK centered at UNK and another weight loss of UNK at UNK STOP 
START the expected weight loss for af going to af and af is UNK STOP 
START mass UNK analysis of UNK UNK upon heating to UNK indicated nitrogen UNK and water vapor STOP 
START the small reaction occurring at UNK is probably caused by decomposition of UNK UNK and perhaps by a small amount of some UNK material other than af STOP 
START all subsequent measurements were made on material which had been heated to UNK for one hour STOP 
START emission spectra indicated af calcium and all other UNK much lower STOP 
START UNK analysis gave UNK UNK as compared with UNK theory STOP 
START however af UNK water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low UNK analysis and high total weight loss STOP 
START the x-ray UNK pattern of the material taken with UNK radiation indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of UNK STOP 
START magnetic analyses by r. g. UNK of this laboratory indicated no UNK UNK STOP 
START af was found to be paramagnetic with three UNK electrons per UNK atom and a molecular UNK of af where af STOP 
START for exactly three UNK electrons the UNK would be UNK STOP 
START an infrared spectrum obtained by h. a. UNK and r. g. UNK of this laboratory showed bands in the positions found by jones STOP 
START electron UNK examination of the af sample showed it to be composed of nearly UNK particles about UNK in diameter STOP 
START the particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the UNK UNK are smaller than this STOP 
START the x-ray data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 a or greater STOP 
START we found no obvious effects due to preferred orientation of the UNK in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron UNK examination STOP 
START nuclear magnetic resonance UNK measurements the magnetic resonance absorption was detected by UNK a UNK model af broad line UNK and the associated UNK UNK system STOP 
START one measurement at 40 UNK was obtained with the UNK model af unit STOP 
START a UNK type of bridge was used in the 10 16 UNK range STOP 
START the UNK power level was maintained small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape UNK by UNK effects STOP 
START a UNK frequency of 40 UNK with an UNK as small as possible UNK with reasonably good UNK quality was used STOP 
START background spectra were obtained in all cases STOP 
START the UNK was adjusted to minimize the amount of UNK mode mixed in with the absorption signal STOP 
START a single value of the thermal UNK time af at room temperature was measured by the progressive UNK method STOP 
START the value of af estimated at UNK UNK was af UNK STOP 
START a single measurement of the UNK UNK UNK time af was obtained at 10 UNK by UNK methods STOP 
START this measurement was obtained by w. UNK of the university of california UNK by observing the UNK of the free UNK decay signal STOP 
START the value derived was 16 UNK STOP 
START field shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line defined as the field about which the first moment is zero STOP 
START second moments of the spectra were computed by numerical integration STOP 
START UNK were applied for UNK UNK apparatus background and field shift STOP 
START spectra were obtained over the temperature range of UNK UNK STOP 
START for the UNK measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and UNK STOP 
START the temperature was maintained to within about af for the period of time required to make the measurement usually about one hour STOP 
START one sample which had been exposed to the atmosphere after UNK at UNK showed the presence of UNK water about UNK UNK as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared due to UNK at low temperature STOP 
START the data reported here are either from spectra from which the UNK water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra of samples UNK and sealed off at UNK which contain no UNK water STOP 
START the measured powder density of the af used here was about af approximately one-third that of the crystal density af STOP 
START such a density UNK to a paramagnetic UNK density of about af STOP 
START spectra were obtained from a UNK sample having the shape of a right circular cylinder with a UNK ratio of 4 STOP 
START the top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom UNK STOP 
START spectra were also obtained from a sample in a UNK UNK which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a UNK glass tube STOP 
START the bubble was filled to the top and special UNK were taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the UNK STOP 
START spectra were also obtained from a third sample of af which had been UNK to three times its original volume with UNK UNK UNK af STOP 
START this sample was contained in a cylindrical UNK similar to that described above STOP

START it was john who found the lion tracks STOP 
START he found them near the UNK of a UNK that had been killed the night before and he UNK once nose to the ground hair shooting up along his back as it did when he was after lion or bear and then he lifted his head and UNK and the pack joined in all heads high and jones knew it was a hot trail STOP 
START he UNK the UNK UNK and let john lead him straight toward the nearby black UNK mountain STOP 
START this mountain was known as the black reef and it rose almost UNK for about two hundred feet UNK with UNK top covered with UNK UNK and UNK and tall grass STOP 
START on the south it ended sharply as though the UNK had been cut off there suddenly STOP 
START UNK and ulyate had started the day together while jones followed the dogs and means and UNK had taken another route and now with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him ulyate UNK in in the shadow of the reef and pointed STOP 
START UNK UNK his field glasses STOP 
START that's the colonel he said but i can't see the dogs STOP 
START as they watched jones rode straight for the reef STOP 
START then they picked up the smaller black UNK on the plain in front of him STOP 
START the dogs were working a trail lion pack had made a bend to the north swinging back toward the reef and UNK and ulyate could hear them UNK STOP 
START UNK got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in UNK between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring UNK and means and the rest of the party STOP 
START not yet UNK ulyate STOP 
START jones came toward them fast now along the southern UNK of the reef and the dogs could be heard plainly old john with his grand canyon voice outstanding above the others STOP 
START there was UNK too also a veteran of the north UNK and UNK and the rake from a pack of english UNK and a UNK from a london pound and UNK a UNK STOP 
START a UNK pack chosen for effectiveness not beauty STOP 
START jones was UNK close behind them leaning down UNK them on STOP 
START light it said and UNK touched a match to the pile of grass blew on it and flame UNK out STOP 
START he threw green stuff on it and a thin blue column of smoke rose STOP 
START that will UNK the gang and tell the colonel where we are STOP 
START two quick shots sounded STOP 
START then there was a chorus of wild UNK and UNK STOP 
START then the heavy roar of a lion STOP 
START UNK and ulyate looked at each other and began to UNK toward the sound STOP 
START it came from the top of the reef not half a mile away STOP 
START at the base of the UNK UNK they left their horses and climbed on foot STOP 
START the route was UNK with rugged UNK UNK and UNK so UNK UNK that when UNK lost sight of ulyate and called ulyate answered from ten feet away STOP 
START nice country to meet a lion in face to face STOP 
START ulyate and UNK climbed on toward the sound of the UNK of the dogs and the UNK UNK of the lion till they came out of breath to the crest and UNK through the branches of a bush this is what ulyate saw jones who had apparently and actually had UNK up the nearly UNK UNK sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a UNK young UNK who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him while the dogs UNK around her STOP 
START ulyate drew back with a start and put finger to lips almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off the dogs have got her UNK STOP 
START she's just the other side of that bush when they had drawn back a step he added jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her STOP 
START why she doesn't charge him i don't know STOP 
START and he hasn't even got a knife on him STOP 
START he couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground STOP 
START careful don't UNK her STOP 
START jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the reef STOP 
START she was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared opening her mouth wide UNK her tail and UNK at the rock with both UNK in UNK as much as to say how dare you UNK me in my sacred UNK told him however that she was tired and UNK from the run up the reef and would not charge yet STOP 
START he moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her being careful because he knew the female is less UNK than the male STOP 
START in the UNK at UNK he had been shown the UNK of UNK big game UNK killed hunting the animals he was attempting to UNK STOP 
START of the UNK seventeen had been killed by UNK and eleven out of the seventeen by UNK STOP 
START she UNK terribly but intuition told him again that she was UNK and he could see that half her attention was UNK by the dogs STOP 
START he threw the UNK STOP 
START it was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock STOP 
START even then if she took one step forward he could catch her STOP 
START but john UNK her rear end one UNK rear end was as good as another to john africa UNK no matter and she changed ends and took a UNK at john but he UNK back STOP 
START jones then UNK his rope and threw again this time hitting her on the back but failing to UNK her STOP 
START she UNK and faced him UNK terribly and ulyate watching through the leaves could not understand why she did not charge and UNK him because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away in that thick growth but she seemed just a trace uncertain jones on the other hand appeared perfectly confident and ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer STOP 
START from the UNK point of view this strange creature on the back of another creature UNK out with its long thin UNK very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with STOP 
START but now she sank lower to the rock STOP 
START her roar changed to a UNK STOP 
START her tail no longer UNK STOP 
START although she appeared more UNK and defeated jones knew she was growing more dangerous STOP 
START she was rested and could mount a charge STOP 
START just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched and she was UNK lightly up and down with her UNK feet STOP 
START at this moment UNK and means arrived UNK through the UNK with their horses and UNK her and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a UNK between two rocks STOP 
START the dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded old john STOP 
START we've got to get her out of there yelled or UNK kill 'em all STOP 
START bring me the UNK STOP 
START for such an emergency he had included UNK UNK UNK as part of their equipment STOP 
START lighting one he UNK it into the UNK and the UNK left off UNK the dogs and UNK STOP 
START ain't she a beauty though out means as she ran STOP 
START don't you go a step nearer her than i do jones warned and if you do go at a run so you'll have momentum two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the reef trying to UNK her onto the plain where they could get a good throw STOP 
START but she clung to the rocks and brush and the day wore away STOP 
START it was hot STOP 
START the dogs were tired STOP 
START the men were tired too STOP 
START it was the story of the UNK fight all over again STOP 
START and the sun was beginning to go down STOP 
START if dark came they would lose her STOP 
START i'll get a pole jones said finally and i'll UNK a UNK over her head this moment she was crouched in a UNK UNK halfway down the reef STOP 
START ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of UNK UNK over UNK heads with poles and of course these were the UNK of fifty years ago not the UNK ones of today and this one was angry with good reason STOP 
START UNK too objected STOP 
START it won't work colonel STOP 
START just the same we'll try it STOP 
START but without waiting for them to try it she scattered the dogs and shot down the reef and out across the plain STOP 
START john led the chase after her and the other dogs UNK out behind many of them UNK blood STOP 
START john himself was UNK and UNK from head to tail but he was in this fight to the finish running almost as strongly now as in the morning STOP 
START she took UNK on a tongue of land extending into a UNK crouched at the base of a UNK tree and waited for them to come up STOP 
START she had chosen the spot well STOP 
START with the UNK on three sides she could be approached only along the tongue of land STOP 
START careful now jones warned STOP 
START means tried her first STOP 
START very slowly he UNK his UNK bay UNK UNK closer watching for a chance to throw but ready to UNK and run rope UNK about his head horse UNK UNK under him but the UNK was UNK and responded and was not UNK by the close UNK of the lion STOP 
START they tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion but these didn't STOP 
START means UNK closer STOP 
START she UNK UNK STOP 
START means spit and UNK on STOP 
START again she UNK and again he UNK STOP 
START the UNK was UNK to her STOP 
START with a UNK jump it could get into gear STOP 
START however nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance unless it was a UNK STOP 
START she charged STOP 
START means spun and UNK STOP 
START for thirty yards she gained rapidly STOP 
START she was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay but and here jones and UNK and ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth she never quite caught up that last bound STOP 
START means held steady one jump ahead of her STOP 
START then gradually he began to pull away STOP 
START a western UNK had UNK an african lion from a standing start STOP 
START UNK showed later that she'd been about six feet from means STOP 
START of course the factor of head start made all the difference STOP 
START how much head start one knew exactly STOP 
START that was the whole question STOP 
START enough was the answer STOP 
START the UNK quickly changed front when she saw she couldn't catch means and made for jones STOP 
START as she had done with means she gained rapidly at first but then UNK began to draw away STOP 
START somewhere in the few UNK yards of head start was the determining point STOP 
START when jones too drew away she returned to a UNK bush in the neck of land running into the UNK crouched low and waited as before STOP 
START this new position however gave the UNK a better chance STOP 
START there was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went STOP 
START so means UNK around on the north side of her jones moved in from the south STOP 
START UNK his rope and shouting he attracted her attention STOP 
START he succeeded almost too well because once she rose as if to charge and he half UNK his horse he was within fifty feet but she sank back STOP 
START from behind her means shot forward at a run STOP 
START UNK began shouting wait wait the UNK UNK means kept on STOP 
START he raced by within twenty feet of her UNK her around the neck but a UNK neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the UNK off STOP

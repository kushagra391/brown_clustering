START at the westminster UNK dog show in madison square garden new york on the second day the UNK of the junior class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this class STOP 
START the class had entries from as far west as wisconsin and as far south as kentucky STOP 
START this year several entries from canada were entered which made the junior class international STOP 
START UNK of the UNK juniors who mailed in entries were present STOP 
START it was interesting to note that many of these juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the UNK of the junior class STOP 
START as has been the custom for the past several years john cross jr. bench show UNK of westminster arranged for the UNK meeting before the class and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them STOP 
START over 60 juniors parents and guests attended STOP 
START mrs. william h. long jr. speaks after the juniors were welcomed and UNK for UNK for the UNK of the junior class mrs. william h. long jr. was introduced as the first speaker STOP 
START in her opening remarks mrs. long also welcomed the juniors and stated there isn't any other show quite like westminster STOP 
START i know because this is my UNK year with hardly a break STOP 
START mrs. long still feels the same unique spirit of westminster which she stated the present juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years STOP 
START twenty years ago her daughter UNK long then 13 years of age won the grand challenge UNK children's handling class as they were called then at westminster STOP 
START no sooner had UNK come out of the ring than mrs. long walked into the working competition with UNK UNK or UNK another UNK product and won from long years of experience mrs. long advised the juniors when showing dogs UNK to be fun and excitement stop have a way of UNK our feelings you and your dog step into the junior ring it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do STOP 
START if you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog he will feel it and give you a good performance knows your signals what is expected of him and the way the class is conducted right up through the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START right attitude essential take away your attitude said mrs. long and what have you left a nervous dog because you are UNK with rage a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop a bored dog because you are more interested in something else maybe the way you look or the date you have after the class or you are just doing this to please the parents STOP 
START the reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the UNK use of your aids can produce STOP 
START aids sounds more like a UNK club or UNK classes riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar your aids are your attitude which comes through your voice your hands and legs voice to encourage UNK or whatever the need may be to guide or UNK to produce motion and rate of speed STOP 
START without right attitude the other aids just do not work right STOP 
START mrs. long wished all the juniors luck in the class and stated have fun may you all continue to show at westminster in the years to come UNK second speaker the second speaker was harvey UNK president of the dog writers UNK of america STOP 
START mr. UNK spoke on the subject of UNK for juniors with which he is very familiar STOP

START he gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship STOP 
START junior showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged one of mr. UNK strong beliefs STOP 
START he feels very UNK that the american UNK club should take a more active part in encouraging the junior division closing mr. UNK also wished all the juniors luck in their class STOP 
START westminster show notes instead of 3 a.m. in the past the juniors class at westminster was held at UNK p.m. STOP 
START this gave the juniors the use of the entire ring at the show a great advantage to them the juniors entered the ring the UNK announced that after all juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up they could relax with their dogs STOP 
START from there on each junior was going to be judged individually STOP 
START this thoughtful gesture was well received by the juniors as the class had an entry of UNK juniors and it took approximately one hour 45 minutes to judge the class STOP 
START anne UNK UNK judges UNK UNK this year anne UNK UNK outstanding UNK judged the class STOP 
START this is the third time in 28 years of junior showmanship at westminster that a lady UNK has judged the class STOP

START a junior who won two or more UNK in the open class was eligible STOP 
START the purpose of the junior showmanship competition is to teach and encourage juniors to become good UNK STOP 
START many adults showing at westminster today are products of this class STOP 
START it seemed an almost impossible job for miss UNK to select 4 UNK from the UNK juniors entered STOP 
START a large number of these juniors have 7 and 8 UNK to their credit and are UNK UNK STOP 
START after the judge moved all the dogs individually she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring STOP 
START she then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship STOP

START most juniors who were entered in the UNK are UNK UNK and not only show and win in junior classes but score in the breed classes as well STOP 
START entries increasing requirements raised in 1960 there were UNK entries in the junior classes STOP

START UNK roberts a leading judge will not be at the international show this year for the junior judging contest as he has been invited to judge in australia in march STOP 
START judging class for UNK proposed it has been suggested many times that a class be set up for the juniors who are UNK and cannot enter the junior classes STOP 
START for some time this writer has been suggesting a junior judging class for UNK over 16 and under 20 years of age who are UNK to compete in the junior class STOP 
START such a class was tried out successfully at the UNK UNK show recently STOP 
START not only were the UNK pleased with the class but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day STOP 
START the UNK in the class with the judge were asked to pick 4 UNK and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the judge STOP 
START we suggested this class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows STOP 
START at the recent horse show convention in new york it was stated that this intermediate judging class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world STOP 
START this class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance STOP 
START last year robert harris a leading junior UNK entered the dog judging contest junior at the international UNK of chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any junior since the UNK UNK STOP 
START juniors who attend this chicago show should make a point to enter this class as it would be of great help to them STOP 
START more UNK UNK needed to judge UNK at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a UNK UNK to judge junior showmanship competition STOP 
START the UNK of the junior showmanship competition the late UNK UNK UNK for whom the UNK is named after at westminster was an outstanding UNK and believed a junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the junior showmanship division STOP 
START some years ago this class was judged by UNK who knew nothing of what was required of a UNK ability to show a dog STOP 
START to overcome this unfair judging the UNK requires that a UNK UNK be present to judge the class STOP 
START if the UNK do not receive more cooperation from UNK it has been suggested that UNK judges also be qualified to judge this class STOP 
START by UNK and helping juniors get interested in the dog world all will be helping to create future dog owners STOP

START we've never been refused settled we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot keep them under control in the room and feed and bench them where they can't do any harm to the UNK or the furniture STOP 
START in the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin a motel owner when we've stopped there again has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children STOP 
START so many times i have wondered why UNK do not UNK the table clean before each new UNK patient is placed on it for examination STOP 
START is it that they don't care they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up UNK from the preceding patient STOP

START when they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the UNK of the human race by human action because there could not possibly be any UNK grave reason to justify such a thing they know exactly what they mean STOP 
START of course in UNK calculation in UNK the good directly intended and done against the evil UNK and indirectly done no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows STOP 
START yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great or evil UNK sufficiently grave to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action STOP 
START i mean however that the moral UNK knows what he means by permit STOP 
START he is not talking in the main about probabilities UNK and danger in general STOP 
START he is talking about an action which just as UNK does an evil thing and is known certainly and UNK to lead to this evil result as it UNK does some good STOP 
START he is talking about double effects of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other but causes both which one is deliberately UNK or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended but still both are done while the evil effect is with equal consciousness on the part of the agent UNK to be among the consequences STOP 
START this is what in a technical sense to only permit an evil result means STOP 
START it means to do it and to know one is doing it but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and UNK STOP 
START of course grave UNK may be UNK to the military action of any nation or to the action of any leader or leaders which for any supposed good permits in this sense the UNK of the human race by human action STOP 
START certainly in UNK an action which truly faced such alternatives it is never possible that no world would be UNK to some UNK and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative STOP 
START naturally where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain this has to be taken into account STOP 
START especially is this true when because the good effect is remote and UNK while the evil is certain and grave the action is UNK STOP 
START presumably if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be UNK weighed and found UNK but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account STOP 
START there must not only be greater good than evil UNK in view but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm STOP 
START if an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be UNK for by a UNK UNK future good by the same UNK not every present certain and immediate good or lesser evil that may have to be done will be UNK by a UNK UNK and future evil STOP 
START nevertheless according to the traditional theory a man begins in the midst of action and he UNK its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences STOP 
START he does not expect to be able to UNK up all the future consequences of his action STOP 
START above all he does not debate mere UNK and therefore if these are possibly UNK find himself forced into UNK STOP 
START he does what he can and may and must without regarding himself as lord of the future or on the other hand as covered with guilt by accident or UNK consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained STOP 
START by contrast a good deal of nuclear UNK begins with the UNK and the probabilities and not with the moral nature of the action to be done by UNK legitimate decision backward from whatever may UNK or possibly or probably result whether by UNK doing or by accident it finds itself driven to UNK to UNK action in politics and UNK action in military affairs and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based STOP 
START mr. philip UNK writes for example that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to UNK war in the near future if the present situation continues STOP 
START if it continues UNK it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the UNK will begin STOP 
START against such a UNK of human life on earth by human action he then UNK as an alternative that we UNK at once with the russians and get the best terms which are available that we deliberately UNK from comparative weakness STOP 
START he UNK attempts to face this alternative UNK i.e. by considering the worst possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few years STOP 
START this would be by far the better choice when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us UNK or of allowing it to destroy itself in UNK and prolonged UNK STOP 
START nevertheless the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere UNK qualified it is a possible result however UNK the worst and least probable result if it didn't UNK mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war STOP 
START if we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are moral decision must be entirely UNK backward from the likely UNK is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself its intention and UNK effect or the thing to be done STOP 
START several of the UNK to mr. UNK without conscious resort to the traditional UNK with regard to the permission of evil succeed in UNK the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made by UNK between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil STOP 
START it is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of UNK STOP 
START i am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of race suicide by accident rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design STOP 
START but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase but may be deliberately reduced by UNK against UNK or by limiting war UNK mr. UNK phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war he UNK says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war STOP 
START if asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility most men will choose the latter STOP 
START if philip UNK is claiming that the choice lies between UNK and the risk of nuclear war i think he is right STOP 
START i do not accept that the choice is between UNK and the certainty of nuclear war STOP 
START even professor arnold UNK UNK with his son does so in these terms compared to continuing to UNK a constant risk of the destruction of the human race all other UNK are lesser UNK STOP 
START let us therefore put first things first and make sure of UNK the human race at whatever the temporary price may be STOP 
START mr. philip UNK UNK at one point that if he shared the UNK of UNK in nineteen UNK if he believed communism was not only evil but also UNK evil then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world STOP 
START even a nuclear UNK is a little less UNK to UNK than a race of UNK UNK UNK the earth until UNK STOP 
START no political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature STOP 
START but one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order UNK in that sense or a static order in which no changes will take place in time to be able UNK to affirm the following fact there has never been UNK UNK in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some UNK preserved by UNK or naked force STOP 
START on their way to the UNK city the children of god make use of the UNK of the UNK city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation STOP 
START not to UNK injury and UNK and improve UNK means not simply to accept the UNK order and injustice that UNK it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place UNK to stand STOP 
START UNK seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social UNK STOP 
START i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country by some deliberate act of refusal than die UNK by UNK STOP 
START would such an act of refusal be useful does not mean in fact he addresses himself specifically to UNK the proposition that if we took the risk of UNK a new generation in britain would soon begin to UNK its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender STOP 
START he wants to be UNK frank and say that these UNK would be hopeless far far more hopeless than was the UNK revolution of 1956 STOP 
START this is not a project for UNK the ground for limited war by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's UNK of unlimited weapons STOP 
START it is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever UNK the search for it or UNK more positive means for UNK it in the past STOP 
START it is no good UNK surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the UNK that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples STOP 
START hope for the future would lie in the natural UNK of the human race for freedom and the right to develop STOP 
START this is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted to the very last is to stride along the steep slope downward STOP 
START the only contrary action in the future as in the past runs the risk of war now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to UNK injury and to preserve any particular civilized UNK of mankind or its UNK justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less UNK by the human race STOP 
START that is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to permitted effects and not draw back in UNK from any conceivable UNK or suffer UNK of action before possibilities or probabilities UNK or not directly UNK related to what we can and may and must do as long as human history UNK STOP 
START finally just as no different issues are UNK for thoughtful analysis by the UNK of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing by human action to UNK this end STOP 
START we should not allow the image of an UNK end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just UNK order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure UNK the end of our UNK may be one consequence among others of many other of UNK UNK toward we know not what future STOP

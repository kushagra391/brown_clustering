START important as was mr. UNK essay his UNK is so UNK as to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously has STOP 
START he and also mr. UNK and mr. warren have fallen to the temptation which UNK many of us to read into our authors UNK UNK for example and UNK UNK protests against UNK material progress and science which are genuine protests of our own but may not have been theirs STOP 
START UNK total works today and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when mr. UNK made his comment or in UNK when mr. UNK wrote his essay reveal no such simple attitude toward the south STOP 
START if he is a UNK he is an UNK UNK STOP 
START if he UNK the recent or the present he UNK the past with no less force STOP 
START if he sees the heroic in a UNK or a UNK he sees also and he shows the blind and the mean and he sees the UNK family UNK from within STOP 
START if the UNK family produces a UNK UNK who UNK UNK and UNK in UNK UNK the UNK family produces a UNK UNK 4 STOP 
START faulkner is a most UNK UNK STOP 
START others writing on faulkner have found the phrase traditional UNK either inadequate or UNK STOP 
START among them are frederick j. UNK william van UNK and mrs. UNK UNK STOP 
START they have indicated the direction but they have not been explicit enough i believe in pointing out UNK independence his questioning if not indeed challenging the southern tradition STOP 
START UNK is not the mind of the UNK which mr. UNK implies that it is STOP 
START he is not one to remain more comfortably and UNK within a body of social cultural or literary traditions than he was within the traditions or possibly the regulations governing his tenure in the post office at oxford mississippi thirty-five years ago STOP 
START that is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions of course that he is UNK in them in fact or that he has dealt with them in his books STOP 
START it is to say rather i believe that he has brought to bear on the history the traditions and the UNK of his region a critical UNK mind the same mind which has made of him an UNK UNK in literary form and technique STOP 
START he has employed from his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed southern STOP 
START the fact that he has cast over those materials the light of a UNK mind does not make him any the less southern i rather think for the south has been no more solid than other regions except in the political and related areas where UNK and force and UNK and fear may produce a surface uniformity STOP 
START some of us might be inclined to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action and an UNK of UNK either mental or physical are particularly southern UNK STOP 
START there is no necessity i suppose to assert that mr. faulkner is southern STOP 
START it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern UNK than that of his family STOP 
START and after all he has lived comfortably at both oxford mississippi and UNK virginia STOP 
START the young william faulkner in new orleans in the UNK impressed the novelist hamilton UNK as obviously conscious of being a UNK and there is no evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so STOP 
START besides showing no UNK apparently to absent himself from his native region even for short periods and in addition writing a shelf of books set in the region he has handled in those books an UNK complete list of matters which have been important in the south during the past hundred years STOP 
START it is more difficult with faulkner than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is the source of his knowledge STOP 
START his own testimony is that he has read very little in the history of the south UNK that what he knows of that history has come to him UNK and that he knows the world around him primarily from his own UNK observation STOP 
START his UNK of extensive reading UNK it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time UNK himself in southern history and that he has gained some UNK with the chief literary authors who have lived in the south or have written about the south STOP 
START to believe otherwise would be UNK STOP 
START but in looking at faulkner against his background in mississippi and the south it is important not to lose the broader perspective STOP 
START his earliest work reflected heavy influences from english and continental writers STOP 
START evidence is UNK that early and later also he has been UNK to the UNK UNK who deal in UNK horror to the UNK writing at the end of the preceding century and in particular to the UNK UNK henry james and james joyce among them STOP 
START his repeated experimentation with the techniques of fiction UNK to an independence of mind and an UNK of approach but it also shows him touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him STOP 
START my intention therefore is not to say that UNK awareness has been confined within the borders of the south but rather that he has looked at his world as a UNK and that presumably his outlook is southern STOP 
START the UNK of UNK novels and stories are by no means new with him and most of the problems he takes up have had the attention of authors before him STOP 
START a useful comment on his relation to his region may be made i think by noting briefly how in handling southern materials and southern problems he has UNK from the pattern set by other southern authors while remaining faithful to the essential character of the region STOP 
START the UNK UNK has appeared in literature at least since john UNK kennedy published UNK in UNK and in his UNK portrait of frank UNK UNK over his plantation UNK initiated the most persistent tradition of southern literature STOP 
START the UNK UNK of the UNK society did not come however until after the civil war when southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed STOP 
START as they looked with UNK to a society which had been swept away they were probably no more than UNK that they painted in colors which had never existed STOP 
START their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the south even while memories of the war were still sharp STOP 
START the tradition reached its UNK perhaps in the works of thomas nelson page toward the end of the century and UNK UNK as late as UNK in the UNK novel so red the rose by UNK young STOP 
START although faulkner was the UNK in his own family to this tradition he did not have UNK UNK UNK to UNK and UNK the UNK society STOP 
START the myth of the southern plantation has had only a UNK relation with UNK as francis UNK UNK showed forty years ago and i suspect it has had a far UNK acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed STOP 
START faulkner has found it useful but he has employed it with his UNK independence of mind and UNK outlook STOP 
START without saying or seeming to say that in UNK the UNK and the UNK families UNK chief concern is social criticism we can say nevertheless that through those families he UNK his comment on the UNK UNK as they have existed since the decades before the civil war STOP 
START it may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard for the treatment in his books is far removed from even the UNK irony of UNK UNK who was the only important novelist before him to challenge the conventional picture of UNK society STOP 
START UNK UNK characters had but few counterparts in earlier southern novels dealing with plantation life STOP 
START they have an UNK extending back however at least to UNK when william UNK described the UNK he encountered in the back country of virginia and north carolina STOP 
START the chief literary UNK of the UNK UNK appeared in the realistic humorous writing which originated in the south and the southwest in the three decades before the civil war STOP 
START these UNK of UNK action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers as a rule and later found their way between book covers though rarely into the UNK libraries beside the UNK volumes of UNK mr. UNK mr. pope and sir walter scott STOP 
START there is evidence to suggest in fact that many authors of the humorous sketches were UNK to write them or to make them as UNK as they are by way of UNK against the artificial UNK which had come to UNK the UNK letters of the south STOP 
START william UNK simms sturdy UNK that he was UNK for a natural UNK such as he found in his favorites the great UNK to UNK the pale writings being produced around him STOP 
START simms admired the UNK tales UNK from the UNK but he had himself social UNK which would not allow him to approve them fully STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK a preacher and a college and university president in four southern states published the earliest of these UNK sketches and in the character UNK UNK in the accounts of sharp UNK and UNK physical combat and in the UNK UNK speech of his characters he set an example followed by many after him STOP 
START others who wrote of low characters and low life included thomas UNK UNK creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen the UNK jones UNK whose character UNK UNK bears a close UNK to UNK UNK in both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and UNK and the UNK with which he UNK carried out his will george washington harris whose tennessee UNK character UNK UNK UNK more UNK UNK and more UNK pain than any other character in literature STOP 
START it would be profitable i believe to read these realistic UNK alongside UNK works the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time to UNK time STOP 
START such a comparison UNK us that in UNK low characters in his works faulkner is recording UNK in the south and moreover is following a UNK literary UNK STOP 
START such characters with their low existence and often low morality produce humorous effects in his novels and tales as they did in the writing of UNK and UNK and harris but it need not be added that he gives them far UNK and more UNK functions than they had in the earlier writers is there need to add that among them are some of the most highly UNK and most successful of his characters STOP 
START one of the early UNK already mentioned thomas UNK UNK can be used to illustrate another point where faulkner touches authentic southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials STOP 
START UNK came to louisiana from the east as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting of romantic adventure and UNK beauty STOP 
START but UNK saw also the UNK of pioneer existence the cultural poverty of the frontier UNK and the UNK morality which UNK in the new regions STOP 
START as a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings he wrote on the one hand sketches of UNK hunting trips and on the other an UNK of the village of UNK arkansas where no one had ever seen a piano he wrote also the UNK of frontier humor the big bear of arkansas in which UNK realism is placed alongside the UNK of the UNK UNK and the UNK with which man UNK the UNK and the UNK of nature STOP

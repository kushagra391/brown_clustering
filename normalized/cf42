START rare indeed is the harlem citizen from the most UNK church member to the most UNK adolescent who does not have a long tale to tell of police UNK injustice or brutality STOP 
START i myself have witnessed and endured it more than once STOP 
START the businessmen and UNK also have a story STOP 
START and so do the UNK STOP 
START and this is not perhaps the place to discuss UNK very complex attitude toward black policemen nor the reasons according to harlem that they are nearly all downtown STOP 
START it is hard on the other hand to blame the policeman blank UNK UNK and UNK innocent for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves STOP 
START he too believes in good intentions and is UNK and UNK when they are not taken for the UNK STOP 
START he has never himself done anything for which to be hated which of us has and yet he is facing daily and UNK people who would UNK see him dead and he knows it STOP 
START there is no way for him not to know it there are few things under heaven more UNK than the silent UNK contempt and hatred of a people STOP 
START he moves through harlem therefore like an UNK soldier in a bitterly hostile country is precisely what and where he is and is the reason he walks in UNK and UNK STOP 
START and he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company the people who are watching him know why too STOP 
START any street meeting sacred or secular which he and his colleagues UNK cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination STOP 
START and these days of course in terms increasingly vivid and UNK it speaks of the end of that domination STOP 
START the white policeman standing on a harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world STOP 
START he is not prepared for it naturally nobody is and what is possibly much more to the point he is exposed as few white people are to the UNK of the black people around him STOP 
START even if he is gifted with the UNK mustard grain of imagination something must UNK in STOP 
START he cannot avoid observing that some of the children in spite of their color remind him of children he has known and loved perhaps even of his own children STOP 
START he knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way STOP 
START he can retreat from his UNK in only one direction into a UNK which very shortly becomes second nature STOP 
START he becomes more UNK the population becomes more hostile the situation grows more tense and the police force is increased STOP 
START one day to UNK UNK someone drops a match in the powder UNK and everything UNK up STOP 
START before the dust has settled or the blood UNK UNK speeches and UNK commissions are loud in the land demanding to know what happened STOP 
START what happened is that negroes want to be treated like men STOP 
START negroes want to be treated like men a perfectly UNK statement containing only seven words STOP 
START people who have UNK UNK UNK shakespeare UNK UNK and the bible find this statement utterly UNK STOP 
START the idea seems to threaten profound barely conscious assumptions STOP 
START a kind of panic UNK their features as though they found themselves UNK on the edge of a steep place STOP 
START i once tried to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the conditions among negroes in the south STOP 
START my UNK disturbed him and made him UNK he asked me in perfect innocence why don't all the negroes in the south move north tried to explain what has happened UNK whenever a significant body of negroes move north STOP 
START they do not escape jim UNK they merely encounter another UNK variety STOP 
START they do not move to chicago they move to the south side do not move to new york they move to harlem STOP 
START the pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand and this expansion is always violent STOP 
START white people hold the line as long as they can and in as many ways as they can from verbal UNK to physical violence STOP 
START but inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto STOP 
START the white people fall back bitterly before the black UNK UNK make a UNK profit by raising the rent UNK up the rooms and all but UNK with the UNK what has once been a neighborhood turns into a UNK STOP 
START this is precisely what happened when the puerto UNK arrived in their thousands and the bitterness thus caused is as i write being fought out all up and down those streets STOP 
START UNK UNK in an extremely dangerous luxury STOP 
START they seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the civil war and won they have earned the right merely to UNK what is going on in the south without taking any responsibility for it that they can ignore what is happening in northern cities because what is happening in little rock or birmingham is worse STOP 
START well in the first place it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is worse STOP 
START i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerners because at least there you haven't got to play any UNK games UNK games referred to have driven more than one negro into the UNK ward the UNK or the river STOP 
START i know another negro a man very dear to me who says with conviction and with truth the spirit of the south is the spirit of america STOP 
START he was born in the north and did his military training in the south STOP 
START he did not as far as i can gather find the south worse found it if anything all too familiar STOP 
START in the second place though even if birmingham is worse no doubt UNK south africa UNK it by several miles and UNK was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world STOP 
START the world has never lacked for UNK examples i do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes STOP 
START this UNK justification UNK the heart of all human feeling STOP 
START the UNK our hearts become the greater will be our crimes STOP 
START UNK the south is not merely an UNK backward region but a part of this country and what happens there concerns every one of us STOP 
START as far as the color problem is concerned there is but one great difference between the southern white and the UNK the UNK remembers historically and in his own UNK a kind of UNK in which he loved black people and they loved him STOP 
START historically the UNK UNK laid across this UNK is the civil war STOP 
START personally it is the UNK sexual coming of age when without any warning UNK UNK are set up between himself and his past STOP 
START everything thereafter is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need STOP 
START the resulting UNK UNK affects every southern mind and is the basis of the southern UNK STOP 
START none of this is true for the UNK STOP 
START negroes represent nothing to him personally except perhaps the dangers of UNK STOP 
START he never sees negroes STOP 
START southerners see them all the time STOP 
START UNK never think about them whereas southerners are never really thinking of anything else STOP 
START negroes are therefore ignored in the north and are under UNK in the south and suffer UNK in both places STOP 
START neither the UNK nor the UNK is able to look on the negro simply as a man STOP 
START it seems to be indispensable to the national UNK that the negro be considered either as a kind of ward in which case we are told how many negroes comparatively bought UNK last year and how few comparatively were UNK or as a victim in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids STOP 
START they are two sides of the same UNK and the south will not change cannot change until the north changes STOP 
START the country will not change until it UNK itself and UNK what it really means by freedom STOP 
START in the meantime generations keep being born bitterness is increased by UNK pride and UNK and the world UNK around us STOP 
START it is a terrible an UNK law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without UNK one's own in the face of one's victim one sees UNK STOP 
START walk through the streets of harlem and see what we this nation have become STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK river downtown UNK to a letter from harlem the fact that american negroes UNK in the u.n. while UNK stevenson was UNK the assembly shocked and UNK most white americans STOP 
START UNK speech and the spectacular UNK in the gallery were both touched off by the death in katanga the day before of UNK lumumba STOP 
START stevenson stated in the course of his address that the united states was against UNK STOP 
START god knows what the african nations who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the u.n. were thinking they may for example have been thinking of the u.s. UNK when the vote on UNK freedom was before the assembly but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the gallery were thinking STOP 
START i had intended to be there myself STOP 
START it was my first reaction upon hearing of UNK death STOP 
START i was curious about the impact of this political UNK on negroes in harlem for lumumba had has captured the popular imagination there STOP 
START i was curious to know if UNK death which is surely among the most sinister of recent events would UNK from our side anything more than the usual UNK UNK STOP 
START and i was curious about the african reaction STOP 
START however the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the u.n. gallery STOP 
START had i been there i too in the eyes of most americans would have been merely a UNK in the hands of the communists STOP 
START the climate and the events of the last decade and the steady pressure of the cold war have given americans yet another means of avoiding UNK and so it has been decided that the UNK were communist inspired STOP 
START nor was it long naturally before prominent negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the u.n. UNK do not represent the real feeling of the negro community STOP 
START according then to what i take to be the prevailing view these UNK were merely a handful of UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START i find this view amazing STOP 
START it is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately UNK STOP 
START one has only for example to walk through harlem and ask UNK two questions STOP 
START the first question is would i like to live here the second question is why don't those who now live here move out answer to both questions is immediately obvious STOP 
START unless one takes UNK in the theory however disguised that negroes are somehow different from white people i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the UNK status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national UNK STOP 
START now i do not doubt that among the people at the u.n. that day there were UNK and professional UNK acting out of the most UNK motives STOP 
START wherever there is great social UNK these people are sooner or later to be found STOP 
START their presence is not as frightening as the UNK which creates their opportunity STOP 
START what i find UNK and really dangerous is the american assumption that the negro is so UNK with his lot here that only the UNK agents of a foreign power can UNK him to protest STOP 
START it is a notion which contains a UNK UNK UNK as it does that negroes can make no move unless they are UNK STOP

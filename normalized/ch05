START the rhode island property tax there was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well STOP 
START for many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several UNK to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax STOP 
START this tax was UNK in UNK STOP 
START since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial UNK on the state which could not have been UNK in earlier years STOP 
START at the same time there has been an UNK and expansion of municipal services as well STOP 
START thus there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and in addition must give assistance to its local governments STOP 
START this financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax or at least at the rates then existing UNK for their requirements STOP 
START consequently there have developed several forms of UNK and shared taxes as well as the UNK grant to local governments for general purposes whose UNK accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level STOP 
START UNK state aid the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax STOP 
START this is being done both by the UNK of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property UNK neglected or ignored STOP 
START taxation of tangible movable property in rhode island has been generally of a hands off nature due possibly to several reasons 1 local assessors in the main are not well paid and have inadequate office UNK 2 the numerous categories of this component of personal property make UNK extremely difficult and 3 the UNK of the majority of assessors in UNK this type of property STOP 
START problems of UNK personal property STOP 
START UNK the many problems in the UNK of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two are significant 1 UNK 2 fair and equitable assessment of value STOP 
START these problems are not local to rhode island but are recognized as common to all states STOP 
START UNK of property STOP 
START UNK the laws of the various states in general specify the UNK of property i.e. residence or UNK of the owner or location of the property the exceptions regarding boats UNK mobile homes etc. seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper UNK point for assessment STOP 
START rhode island law UNK that all real estate is UNK in the town in which it is situated STOP 
START it also provides for the taxation of all personal property belonging to inhabitants of the state both tangible and UNK and the tangible personal property of UNK in this state STOP 
START in UNK personal property it specifically UNK all ships or vessels at home or abroad STOP 
START UNK property is UNK wherever the owner has a place of UNK the greater portion of the year STOP 
START although a similar UNK for tangible property is mentioned in the statute this is UNK out by the provision that definite kinds of property and all other tangible property situated or being in any town is UNK where the property is situated STOP 
START this would seem to fix the tax UNK of all movable personal property at its location on december 31 STOP 
START both boats and aircraft would fall within this category as well as motor vehicles STOP 
START the location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is UNK STOP 
START obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the UNK day of december STOP 
START in view of the acceptance UNK the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft STOP 
START a recent example of this problem is the flying of six UNK on december 31 1960 from the newport UNK in UNK to the north central airport in UNK STOP 
START this situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax and probably UNK STOP 
START UNK bases its claim on the general provision of the law that all UNK property both tangible and UNK shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of UNK for the larger portion of the twelve 12 months next preceding the first day of april in each year STOP 
START the UNK tax UNK in turn claims the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated STOP 
START assessment of value STOP 
START UNK problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair UNK is dependent on local assessors who in general are UNK and part-time personnel taking an UNK approach to the problem STOP 
START this accounts for the wide UNK in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various UNK in rhode island STOP 
START this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established or through mutual agreement of the local UNK officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted STOP 
START the rhode island public expenditure council in its publication once commented the most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for UNK all UNK property STOP 
START an adequately UNK and equipped state UNK office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable UNK on all properties throughout the state STOP 
START a single statewide UNK unit would eliminate the differences and UNK that are inherent in a system of UNK different and independent UNK units STOP 
START the institute of public administration in its report to the state fiscal study commission in 1959 recommended UNK and UNK all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency UNK organized and equipped for the job STOP 
START the resulting UNK it was declared would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than rhode island STOP 
START practices in rhode island STOP 
START UNK determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in rhode island STOP 
START the UNK from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case STOP 
START there are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town STOP 
START these opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time STOP 
START in reply to a question of whether they now tax boats UNK and other movable property excluding automobiles nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not STOP 
START the UNK of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations STOP 
START one UNK checked boats only another trailers and UNK one mentioned house trailers and two others referred to trailers without UNK the type STOP 
START in two cases UNK only were indicated STOP 
START it is difficult to UNK exactly what was meant in each individual situation but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not UNK movable personal property and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes STOP 
START boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats STOP 
START it would seem then that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be UNK for that particular kind of personal property STOP 
START so few answered the question relating to their efforts to UNK movable property that the results are UNK STOP 
START only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind STOP 
START of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was UNK according to its location or ownership STOP 
START fifteen stated that it was according to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen did not answer STOP 
START UNK assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for UNK movable personal property and only five were opposed STOP 
START seven others expressed no opinion STOP 
START on this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now STOP 
START it is not clear however whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats trailers aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be UNK to their particular towns STOP 
START another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner STOP 
START eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner UNK STOP 
START ten others made no reply STOP 
START of those who have an opinion it seems that assessment by location is preferred STOP 
START there was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date STOP 
START to UNK it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessors would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge STOP 
START the need for greater knowledge is evident from their UNK STOP 
START boats as personal property UNK of boats STOP 
START UNK has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of UNK boats STOP 
START assessors in rhode island are charged not only with placing a UNK upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting STOP 
START it has been obvious to the assessors particularly those in shore communities that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach STOP 
START through their professional organization the rhode island tax officials association the question of UNK boats long has been UNK and discussed STOP 
START no satisfactory solution has been found but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or UNK on the part of the assessors STOP 
START it has been estimated that the value of boats in rhode island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars excluding commercial boats STOP 
START it is obvious that this is a potential and UNK source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation STOP 
START it is known that at least five towns UNK UNK UNK newport and UNK place some value on some boats for tax purposes STOP 
START however few are taxed and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town UNK STOP 
START no one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their UNK value may be STOP 
START slightly more than UNK boats were registered with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law STOP 
START only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the division of UNK and rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a UNK brought the season to an early close STOP 
START the UNK association meeting at UNK in september 1960 devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem STOP

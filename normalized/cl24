START about halfway back pops UNK against a wall and stopped pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through STOP 
START UNK he whispered floor UNK about three feet down so don't fall STOP 
START i went through and down into pitch darkness STOP 
START he said UNK stay still STOP 
START i'll pull the boards back and then get us a light STOP 
START UNK stay where you are STOP 
START i UNK stayed where i was while he UNK around and then walked away STOP 
START a moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle and i could see STOP 
START it was a big room empty except for a few things of UNK at the far end a wooden UNK on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an UNK UNK STOP 
START i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him hung another half of a blanket over the UNK window so no light would show through STOP 
START i took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket STOP 
START you first i said STOP 
START he drank and handed it back STOP 
START nice place i told him STOP 
START listen i got a buddy i travel with real nice guy named UNK STOP 
START i know where he is right near here STOP 
START could he join the party and sleep here tonight too both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you STOP 
START he hesitated a second looking at the bottle before he said UNK and i UNK him STOP 
START he'll bring a bottle too and i'll get another one or maybe two while i'm out STOP 
START you can work on this one while i'm gone kill it if you want STOP 
START i took a short UNK from it myself and handed it to him STOP 
START his UNK was enthusiastic this time STOP 
START he put the bottle down STOP 
START UNK over by the window while there's light UNK i'll put UNK candle out STOP 
START when UNK come back i'll put it out UNK till you're both inside STOP 
START charlie was waiting leaning against a building front STOP 
START perfect UNK i told him STOP 
START but we got to go back to fifth and get another bottle or two STOP 
START on the way i'll give you the UNK STOP 
START on the way i gave him the UNK STOP 
START i bought another pint of UNK and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again STOP 
START i introduced my friend UNK to pops and we made ourselves comfortable STOP 
START there was still a little not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it and charlie opened his STOP 
START i was reminded UNK by a poem of UNK UNK called the murder of two men by a young kid wearing lemon colored UNK which patchen himself read on a record against jazz background STOP 
START the poem consisted of only two words the word wait repeated over and over at UNK intervals and with different UNK and then the word now a UNK final UNK from the jazz group STOP 
START this was the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing UNK STOP 
START but we could wait all right was no hurry STOP 
START i said wait wait to charlie and he grinned UNK the reference STOP 
START we'd heard the record together once STOP 
START the second bottle passed a few times STOP 
START pops was taking long ones but not showing the effect yet STOP 
START he seemed as drunk as when i'd first talked to him but no UNK STOP 
START he had a capacity we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine STOP 
START about halfway through the second bottle charlie looked at me across pops who was sitting between us and asked now said wait and handed the bottle to pops for his final drink STOP 
START when he handed it back and i had hold of it safely pops was looking toward me and i said now to charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket once STOP 
START it was a lead pipe UNK STOP 
START there was a sound like the one you produce by UNK a UNK with your finger only louder and pops fell forward from the waist and then over UNK STOP 
START out cold if not dead he'd never known what hit him he'd never known that anything had hit him STOP 
START i reached my hand toward him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a UNK but charlie said wait and said it sharply not as in the patchen bit but as an order so i stopped my hand and looked at him STOP 
START he was holding the piece of lead pipe out to me STOP 
START we don't want to know whether he's dead yet STOP 
START i UNK that blow to be UNK STOP 
START to UNK him and maybe or maybe not kill STOP 
START you hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not STOP 
START that way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the UNK STOP 
START UNK dug him i saw his point made sense STOP 
START i took the piece of pipe from UNK hand and used it harder than he had STOP 
START the UNK was louder anyway and i thought i heard bone crack STOP 
START charlie said good boy STOP 
START that did it if mine didn't STOP 
START and we'll never know which STOP 
START all right now i'll give you a hand STOP 
START we straightened pops up and i made sure there was no trace of a UNK STOP 
START i nodded to charlie STOP 
START let's put him down again the way he was STOP 
START it's a more natural position STOP 
START we did that STOP 
START how do you feel asked me STOP 
START cool i told him STOP 
START what do you feel nothing STOP 
START well maybe i'm UNK STOP 
START it was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for UNK STOP 
START but let's not talk about it UNK until we're out of here STOP 
START now first question the bottles STOP 
START shall we take them all with us or leave one take them i said STOP 
START if we left one we'd have to UNK it for UNK STOP 
START here's the picture we want to leave for the UNK whenever the body gets found STOP 
START this happened in the middle of a drinking UNK with another UNK STOP 
START if they'd been working on a bottle or a UNK he'd have taken it with him STOP 
START right STOP 
START and he'd have taken the weapon with him too so we take that STOP 
START now he looked around STOP 
START i've been careful about UNK STOP 
START how about you same STOP 
START there are the boards over the window of course but they're not painted and too rough to take UNK STOP 
START same goes for the rough cement of the UNK STOP 
START besides i doubt if the cops will even try UNK STOP 
START they find dead UNK every day maybe they won't even UNK him for the cause of death STOP 
START we can't take a chance on that STOP 
START we've got to assume they'll decide he was UNK and we've got to keep the picture consistent STOP 
START our UNK other UNK who killed him would have turned out his pockets STOP 
START let's do that STOP 
START we did that and found a dirty UNK some matches and fourteen cents in change STOP 
START we took the matches they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain UNK and the change STOP 
START we discussed the candle and decided the UNK other UNK would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason to blow it out STOP 
START the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the UNK when it UNK out STOP 
START a fire wouldn't have UNK except that it would cause pops to be found sooner STOP 
START he might not be found for days even weeks otherwise STOP 
START we went once more over every point then UNK STOP 
START being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger and we weren't picked up by a cop STOP 
START in fact nobody saw us cop or citizen STOP 
START UNK is a quiet street with no UNK and was completely deserted at that hour STOP 
START which if it matters was one a.m. STOP 
START less than three hours ago we'd decided in UNK UNK UNK on UNK to commit a trial murder STOP 
START it had gone like UNK STOP 
START almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told myself that was ridiculous STOP 
START how safe is too safe like that can get you into a UNK UNK STOP 
START an hour later we were back in my UNK UNK killing what had been left of the second pint STOP 
START we decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow STOP 
START also our plans for me to commit UNK murder and for him to commit mine STOP 
START but we were really going to do it STOP 
START we shook hands on it STOP 
START we planned ahead only one step a UNK for tomorrow when we could UNK notes STOP 
START i'd tell him everything i'd learned about UNK habits and habitat and he'd tell me the score on UNK STOP 
START we made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START charlie would get there early because he had the key STOP 
START from here on in the less charlie and i were seen together in public or visited one UNK rooms the better STOP 
START i was dead tired and slept UNK as far as i know UNK STOP 
START we met at UNK and decided we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the evening to talk things out STOP 
START charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks STOP 
START i'd brought along the virgin pint from last night but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking STOP 
START i talked first telling him everything i knew about UNK and his house and domestic arrangements STOP 
START i drew UNK and floor plans UNK them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and UNK them down STOP 
START he gave me equivalent and even more detailed UNK on UNK including UNK one of the apartment building UNK lived in and one of the apartment itself STOP 
START he'd been there several times back when while he and UNK had been friends or at least not enemies STOP 
START it didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might was not quite six o'clock when we finished and charlie said well i guess that's it STOP 
START shall we UNK a UNK to see which of us goes first would you rather deal a hand of UNK UNK or play a game of gin UNK or what wait a minute charlie i said STOP 
START one thing we haven't discussed expense money STOP 
START we'll need some at least if only bus UNK to the scene of the crime STOP 
START and if you're as flat broke as i am i think we'll have to take the added risk of UNK over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an UNK while the other does his dirty work STOP 
START he sighed STOP 
START all right i'll come clean STOP 
START i've got a little UNK for a UNK day and i guess this is UNK enough STOP 
START a couple of hundred STOP 
START if you draw the short straw i'll lend you some bread like fifty UNK before i take off to visit my sister in UNK STOP 
START then after i'm back another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid UNK somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy STOP 
START solid i said STOP 
START i took a deep breath and the UNK STOP 
START in that case let's not draw STOP 
START i'll go to bat first STOP 
START you'd have to wait till UNK back from mexico city and also while i set it up with UNK to have her have an UNK for UNK STOP 
START so it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything STOP 
START but your friend UNK can go any time STOP 
START he grinned and UNK me on the shoulder STOP 
START i was hoping you'd say that UNK STOP 
START but i wouldn't have suggested it STOP 
START well in that case i take off tomorrow morning for UNK STOP 
START and in case i brought the money with me STOP

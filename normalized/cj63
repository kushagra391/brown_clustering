START the UNK society is an ambitious work STOP 
START its scope is as broad as the question what does it mean to live in modern society work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision must necessarily fail STOP 
START even a UNK reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and argument important UNK areas of ignorance and prejudice undue UNK on UNK examples of broad positions supported by UNK evidence and the like STOP 
START such books are easy UNK for critics STOP 
START nor need the critic be UNK STOP 
START a careful and orderly man who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be put off by such a book STOP 
START it is a simple matter for one so disposed to take a work like the UNK society and UNK it into odds and ends STOP 
START the thing can be made to look like the UNK attic of a large and vigorous family a UNK UNK of UNK objects some UNK and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but now UNK and UNK some odd pieces whose history no one remembers here and there a UNK everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the UNK history of the makers and UNK STOP 
START that could be easily done but there is little reason in it STOP 
START it would come down to saying that fromm UNK with a broad brush and that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset STOP 
START i mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the UNK character and therefore must be mentioned STOP 
START it would be UNK to build a UNK around them STOP 
START there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account of UNK civilization STOP 
START it is UNK to recall that fromm's treatment has both UNK and UNK aspects STOP 
START since i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment STOP 
START i shall first indicate a couple of UNK in fromm's analysis then argue that granted these UNK he still has much left that is valuable and finally raise the general question of a philosophical UNK a sociological approach to the question of alienation STOP 
START almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation STOP 
START despite its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a UNK theory STOP 
START the idea has received much attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general social criticism such as the UNK society STOP 
START what is missing is work that would answer presumably by the use of survey methods and UNK attitude UNK such questions as these what are the components of the UNK described as alienation widespread is alienation is its UNK among the various classes and UNK of the population alienation as a dependent variable with what UNK factors is it most highly associated as an independent variable how does it affect behavior in various UNK of life such work is done there must remain the UNK suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the UNK of the intellectual who rejected by and in turn UNK the larger society projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen STOP 
START i am not suggesting that fromm ought to do this kind of work STOP 
START nor do i think that alienation is nothing more than a UNK of the UNK of the intellectual STOP 
START i am saying only that until a UNK and different kind of evidence comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations STOP 
START until such evidence appears we must make do with the evidence we have STOP 
START here perhaps fromm is vulnerable for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available and he sometimes UNK and UNK the evidence in rather special ways STOP 
START three examples follow STOP 
START fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the UNK of the corporation the separation of ownership from control and the broad and thus from the point of view of corporate control UNK UNK of stock ownership STOP 
START for all these points he UNK exclusively on UNK and UNK study of UNK the modern corporation and private property STOP 
START the broad conclusions of that UNK work remain UNK but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested important UNK in the general analytic frame of reference and has UNK the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area STOP 
START fromm seems unaware of these developments STOP 
START another example is his very UNK use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of UNK he UNK such UNK findings just three times STOP 
START moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible STOP 
START for example he UNK the following data from two studies on job satisfaction in the first study UNK per cent of UNK and UNK UNK per cent of white collar people and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs the second study the UNK were UNK for UNK UNK for UNK persons 42 for commercial employees UNK for skilled workers and UNK for UNK workers STOP 
START he UNK that these data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously UNK and unhappy persons among factory and UNK workers STOP 
START starting from other value UNK than fromm's some UNK might conclude that the UNK really tell us very little at all while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low STOP 
START UNK UNK for example once said that america was a paradise the only one in the history of the world for UNK and small children STOP 
START what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied STOP 
START fromm also UNK a UNK on attitudes toward work UNK conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which UNK per cent of UNK workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount STOP 
START fromm says these data show that job UNK and resentment are widespread STOP 
START that is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways STOP 
START one might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter to fromm's theory of alienation STOP 
START or he might remind fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really UNK low after all the medieval UNK system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view STOP 
START in view of these UNK in both the amount and the interpretation of UNK findings on public opinion and considering the criticisms which can be brought against fromm's philosophical UNK such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously STOP 
START are people happy are they as satisfied UNK as they believe themselves to be the nature of man and the conditions for happiness this can hardly be so STOP 
START the UNK suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm's style of thought STOP 
START he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways STOP 
START sometimes he uses it as a subjective UNK term and sometimes as an objective UNK one STOP 
START that is sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery and other times it is UNK to explain UNK anxiety and UNK STOP 
START the failure to keep these two UNK distinct presents UNK to the reader STOP 
START it also permits fromm to do some UNK things with empirical findings STOP 
START when alienation is used as an objective and UNK category for example it becomes clear that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward UNK it STOP 
START he in effect does say this in his discussion of the UNK of the UNK UNK STOP 
START starting from this and accepting his estimate of the UNK of modern society it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a UNK survey which reported widespread stated worker satisfaction rather than widespread stated worker UNK STOP 
START the point is that in a system such as fromm's which UNK unconscious UNK and which rests on certain ethical UNK empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is UNK at the moment STOP 
START thus in the example cited above fromm rests his whole case on the UNK that the workers are being UNK UNK UNK of fulfillment and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious experienced UNK STOP 
START he has his cake and UNK it too if the workers say they are UNK this shows conscious alienation they say they are satisfied this shows unconscious alienation STOP 
START this sort of UNK is especially UNK in fromm's work because although his system is derived largely from certain UNK convictions he UNK that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room STOP 
START while the empirical UNK label which fromm claims UNK no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy it does increase the UNK of his product STOP 
START the final example of the failure to use available evidence though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same UNK STOP 
START in a brief chapter dealing with various other UNK he UNK isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to UNK his own and finds it most remarkable that a critical view of UNK society was already held by a number of UNK living in the nineteenth STOP 
START he finds it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and UNK should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth century STOP 
START there is nothing remarkable about this at all STOP 
START it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes STOP 
START there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's UNK of the other UNK fits the latter category STOP 
START glance at the list UNK UNK UNK UNK london UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK a. r. UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START this is a UNK UNK collection STOP 
START one can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear STOP 
START the method of selection fromm uses UNK exactly that STOP 
START furthermore the list is interesting for its UNK STOP 
START it UNK for example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called UNK STOP 
START of course the list also UNK all writers who are fairly optimistic about the modern situation almost by definition are spokesmen for an UNK ideology STOP 
START it is not hard to find that UNK of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion STOP 
START turning from these problems of the use of evidence one meets another type of difficulty in fromm's analysis which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms STOP 
START one such instance has already been presented his use of alienation STOP 
START the only other one i shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism STOP 
START for fromm capitalism is the enemy the root of all evil STOP 
START it is of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one's social criticism for it makes diagnosis and UNK much easier than they might otherwise be STOP

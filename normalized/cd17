START experts in the publishing field consider this UNK STOP 
START they do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no UNK sale could have achieved such a following STOP 
START to me the explanation is very simple STOP 
START i am not doing anything of myself STOP 
START i am merely a channel for something STOP 
START what is this something cannot define it fully STOP 
START it is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness even when they turn away from it STOP

START fifteen years ago troubled by the rising tide of UNK in the UNK world a UNK and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women regardless of UNK or color could set forth UNK their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living STOP 
START the UNK was raymond UNK STOP 
START the minister was norman vincent UNK STOP 
START neither had any publishing experience but they had faith in their idea STOP

START but from the start they had two important UNK sincerity and realism STOP 
START the people who told the stories were sincere STOP 
START and the stories they told were true STOP

START the hated UNK UNK had fled STOP 
START UNK flew from lip to lip that UNK castro was on his way to havana coming from the mountains where he had fought UNK for five years STOP 
START already the city was filled with UNK the UNK UNK UNK carrying UNK waving to the crowds that lined the UNK STOP 
START and then castro himself did come UNK smiling if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips STOP 
START at first i was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man STOP 
START i am sure that castro was happy too about that support STOP 
START UNK de la UNK was the oldest and most influential paper in cuba with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny STOP 
START my grandfather had been UNK because of his UNK STOP 
START my own earliest memories are of UNK my three brothers and i were taken often to the united states to visit relatives while my father stayed on to fight the UNK UNK STOP 
START when it was my turn i too printed the truth as i knew it about UNK and UNK to see his regime UNK STOP 
START none of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead STOP 
START i was full of hope as UNK castro came into havana STOP 
START within a week however i began to suspect that something was wrong STOP 
START for castro was bringing cuba not freedom but hatred STOP 
START he spent long hours before the tv UNK out promises of UNK STOP

START in my mind i began to review his use of hate to gain support people's courts division of society into two classes one the hero the other the UNK STOP 
START but most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the palace came from communist countries STOP 
START what should i do about it i asked myself had watched castro handling his enemies before the UNK STOP 
START there was no doubt in my mind that if i crossed him UNK would appear outside our windows shouting UNK what should i do was proud of the new buildings which housed UNK now the UNK UNK behind glass doors UNK and UNK of our new UNK STOP 
START here was a powerful UNK medium but it could speak only if i told it to STOP 
START then one day early in january 1960 i sat down at my desk and suddenly i was aware of the UNK STOP 
START it was a simple ivory UNK which my mother had given me STOP 
START i had mounted it on UNK and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner STOP 
START now it seemed almost as if jesus were looking down at me with UNK in his eyes saying you will lose the paper STOP 
START you may lose your life STOP 
START but do you have any choice knew in that moment that i did not have any choice STOP

START UNK of the conjugates in attempting to improve UNK of staining the UNK UNK used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways 1 they were passed through UNK twice and treated with UNK insoluble UNK UNK 1958 prepared from UNK liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown UNK tissue produced by UNK UNK e. f. smith UNK on sweet clover stems STOP 
START 2 the conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed for 30 minutes with 20 50 mg of proteins UNK from healthy sweet clover stems STOP 
START the proteins were UNK with 3 volumes of af in af to give a nearly neutral UNK and UNK by UNK UNK with af STOP 
START the UNK was washed twice with an UNK UNK solution of af dissolved in a small quantity of UNK m neutral UNK buffer UNK against cold UNK water till free from UNK UNK and UNK using liquid nitrogen STOP 
START 3 in other experiments the indirect UNK was treated with 3 volumes of UNK UNK as recommended by UNK and UNK 1957 STOP 
START 4 the conjugates were passed through a UNK UNK UNK column UNK with neutral UNK buffer UNK containing af UNK UNK and af STOP 
START preparation of frozen sections the technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that described by UNK et al 1951 STOP 
START root and stem UNK from sweet clover plants UNK with wtv were UNK in liquid nitrogen UNK in ice and cut at 3 6 UNK in a UNK maintained at UNK to UNK STOP 
START the sections were mounted on cold UNK UNK with UNK UNK UNK 1940 in earlier experiments and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components reported by UNK and UNK 1959 STOP 
START the latter UNK was found to be much more satisfactory STOP 
START the sections were then UNK by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 30 minutes used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks STOP 
START staining technique indirect method STOP 
START -hlthe sections were fixed in UNK for 15 minutes and dried at UNK for 30 minutes STOP 
START some of them were then covered with a drop of af in a moist chamber at UNK for 30 40 minutes STOP 
START as controls other sections were similarly covered with aj STOP 
START sections were then washed with UNK for 15 30 minutes STOP 
START after UNK out most of the saline around the sections a drop of af was UNK over each of the sections allowed to react for 30 minutes and then washed with UNK for 15 30 minutes STOP 
START after UNK out most of the liquid around the sections the latter were mounted in UNK UNK 7 parts UNK to 3 parts of UNK STOP 
START direct method STOP 
START UNK drying the sections under the fan fixing in UNK and drying at UNK as in the indirect method the sections were treated with UNK af or af UNK unless mentioned otherwise for 5 30 minutes STOP 
START as controls other sections were similarly treated with af or UNK UNK to the new york strain of potato UNK virus UNK and black 1956 STOP 
START the sections were then washed with UNK for 15 30 minutes and mounted in UNK UNK STOP 
START fluorescence UNK stained or UNK sections were examined under dark field UNK in a UNK fluorescence UNK equipped with a UNK vapor lamp UNK UNK 200 STOP 
START the light beam from the lamp was UNK through a UNK thickness UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START in the UNK a UNK 2 b UNK was used to UNK off UNK UNK light STOP 
START a red UNK UNK UNK UNK with the code UNK UNK UNK 23 was also used in the UNK lens assembly as it improved the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence STOP 
START results UNK of staining indirect method STOP 
START -hlin the first few experiments af was passed through UNK twice and absorbed twice with 50 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder STOP 
START the intermediate sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder STOP 
START sections of sweet clover stem and root UNK were treated with 1 10 solution of af for 30 minutes washed in UNK saline for 15 minutes stained with af for 30 minutes and washed for 15 minutes in aj STOP 
START such sections showed bright UNK specific fluorescence in the cells of the UNK tissue lee and black 1955 STOP 
START this specific fluorescence was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in UNK sections stained with 1 10 UNK of UNK and af or with af alone STOP 
START UNK sections mounted in UNK UNK or sections treated only with UNK or af did not show such green fluorescence STOP 
START sections of crown UNK tissue similarly stained with either af and af or UNK and af also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence STOP 
START however the nonspecific staining by the af in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of wtv antigen STOP 
START two UNK of af with UNK UNK or two UNK of af which had been passed through UNK UNK and af with crown UNK tissue powder or UNK liver powder did not further improve the UNK of staining STOP 
START treatment of all the sera with sweet clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence especially when the treated UNK was UNK to 1 2 with UNK saline STOP 
START in all the above procedures when the intermediate sera were UNK to 1 10 or 1 100 with UNK saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence were not UNK reduced whereas a UNK of the intermediate sera to 1 500 or UNK the af to 1 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence STOP 
START UNK the sections with UNK before UNK the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction STOP 
START in addition to other treatments treating the sections with normal sheep serum for half an hour before UNK af did not reduce nonspecific staining STOP 
START the only treatment by which nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the UNK through a UNK column STOP 
START when 1 ml of UNK was passed through a column af the first and second UNK fractions collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments and very little in others STOP 
START in the latter cases an additional treatment of the UNK af with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the UNK STOP 
START after these treatments the UNK did not UNK healthy or crown UNK sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily UNK from the bright UNK specific staining STOP 
START with this UNK UNK the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections with 1 10 UNK of af for 30 minutes washing with UNK for 15 minutes staining with af for 30 minutes and washing with UNK for 15 minutes STOP 
START the UNK of staining in wtv UNK with af and af but not with UNK and af or with UNK to potato UNK virus and af and the absence of such staining in crown UNK tumor tissue from UNK indicate that an antigen of wtv was being stained STOP 
START direct method STOP 
START UNK was first UNK with 50 mg of UNK per UNK of UNK STOP 
START this UNK was passed twice through UNK and treated with various tissue UNK in the same manner as described for the indirect method STOP 
START in all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still present although it was still UNK from specific fluorescence STOP 
START in later experiments af and af were prepared by UNK 8 mg of UNK per UNK of UNK STOP 
START these conjugates af had much less nonspecific staining than the previous UNK with 50 mg UNK per UNK of UNK while the specific staining was similar in both cases STOP 
START nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates through a UNK column as described for af STOP 
START the best staining procedure with this UNK af consisted of staining with the UNK for 30 minutes and washing in UNK for 15 minutes STOP 
START the UNK of staining with af was established as follows af specifically stained tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or of crown UNK tumor tissue from sweet clover STOP 
START sections of UNK UNK by wtv were not similarly stained with UNK normal serum or UNK UNK to potato UNK virus STOP 
START after passing af through UNK the UNK of UNK to wtv in the specific fraction was 1 4 of the UNK before such passage UNK ring tests by r. f. UNK mere UNK of the UNK to 1 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining STOP 
START this indicates that increase in UNK of af after passing it through UNK was not merely due to UNK STOP 
START specific staining by UNK treated af and af although clearly UNK under the UNK from either nonspecific staining or UNK of cells was not satisfactorily UNK to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color UNK STOP 
START this was chiefly because of the UNK white UNK from the cells STOP 
START the UNK from the walls of the UNK cells was particularly brilliant STOP 
START distribution of virus antigen results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the UNK of wtv antigen in certain tissues of UNK STOP 
START the virus antigen was concentrated in the UNK tissue STOP 
START frequently a few isolated UNK cells or rarely groups of such cells in the UNK region were also specifically stained but there was no such staining in UNK UNK most UNK cells ray cells or UNK STOP 
START within the UNK cells the distribution of wtv antigen was UNK in the UNK STOP 
START no antigen was UNK in certain dark UNK areas in most cells STOP 
START these areas are thought to represent the nuclei STOP 
START in some tumor sections small UNK bodies possibly UNK bodies UNK and black 1952 stained more UNK than the rest of UNK and probably contained more antigen STOP 
START in all cases studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not contain UNK amounts of wtv antigen STOP 
START discussion in both the direct and indirect methods of staining the conjugates had UNK staining fractions STOP 
START in the indirect method this was evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green even when stained with UNK and af or with af only STOP 
START in the direct method af not further treated stained certain tissues of healthy sweet clover stems UNK and wtv tumor sections were similarly stained by comparable af STOP 
START after af and af were passed through UNK twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount of such staining was still present STOP 
START treatment of the conjugates with UNK UNK and the conjugates which had been passed through UNK with UNK liver powder sweet clover crown UNK tissue powder or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove UNK staining substances in the conjugates STOP 
START such treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining in several other systems UNK 1958 STOP 
START UNK and UNK 1959 did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with UNK UNK UNK to tobacco UNK virus STOP 
START the reason for the failure of these treatments to eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not known STOP 
START in our work the best procedure for UNK substances causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was to pass the conjugates through a UNK column and in some cases to absorb the first and second UNK fractions with sweet clover tissue powder STOP 
START the specific staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that wtv antigen was concentrated in the UNK tissue and in a few UNK cells in the UNK region but was not UNK in any other tissues of the root and stem UNK STOP 
START a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the UNK cells indicates that it is UNK distributed in the UNK STOP 
START UNK virus is a UNK UNK virus not easily UNK by mechanical UNK black 1944 et al 1954 STOP 
START the concentration and apparent UNK of the wtv antigen in UNK tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus UNK UNK in the UNK and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order to UNK plants STOP

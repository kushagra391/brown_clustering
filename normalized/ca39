START this is baseball 1961 STOP 
START this is the year home runs ranged from the UNK to the ridiculous STOP

START UNK UNK about lively balls and lively UNK the UNK strike zone and the fact that the UNK pitch is now UNK STOP 
START experts point to the UNK of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion STOP 
START whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season produced such UNK UNK upon the bureau of baseball records UNK division STOP 
START of all the records in UNK one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now UNK dramatic in its UNK STOP 
START this of course is UNK most remarkable mark the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the UNK UNK the incredible UNK george UNK UNK ruth of the yankees STOP 
START since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at UNK UNK record and each in turn has been UNK STOP

START double threat always in the UNK attacks upon UNK record one man alone a UNK UNK UNK in UNK or a hank UNK UNK in UNK or a UNK wilson UNK in 1930 made the bid STOP 
START but now for the first time since lou UNK with UNK home runs UNK ruth on in 1927 two men playing for the same team have UNK in on 60 STOP 
START their names are mantle and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real STOP

START after UNK games in 1961 mickey mantle has UNK roger maris 41 STOP 
START extend UNK and UNK present UNK over the full 1961 schedule of UNK games and UNK each will hit more than 60 home runs STOP 
START this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them STOP 
START to better UNK mark neither needs a spectacular september UNK STOP 
START all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september and he will establish a new record STOP 
START in UNK day and until this year the schedule was UNK games STOP 
START baseball commissioner ford UNK has ruled that UNK record will remain official unless it is broken in UNK games STOP 
START even on the basis of UNK games this is the ideal situation UNK hank UNK now vice-president of the chicago white sox STOP 
START it has to be easier with two of them STOP 
START how can you walk maris to get to mantle neither mantle nor maris UNK will UNK 60 home runs for himself STOP 
START although both UNK they would like to hit 60 they stick primarily to the baseball UNK standard quote the important thing is to win the UNK STOP 
START but one thing is for certain there is no UNK between mantle the american UNK most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 and maris the UNK in 1960 STOP 
START each UNK seeing the other hit home runs i hope roger hits 80 mantle says and each UNK even more seeing himself hit home runs and i hope i hit UNK STOP 
START the UNK get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer UNK in dallas UNK in kansas city they are UNK together STOP

START as UNK UNK and UNK UNK mantle 29 who broke in with the yankees ten years ago and maris 26 who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago have UNK similar UNK STOP 
START both were UNK stars in football UNK and baseball mantle in commerce UNK maris in UNK UNK UNK both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma sometimes in the UNK maris recalls i wished i had gone to oklahoma STOP 
START to an extent the two even look alike STOP

START with their huge backs and UNK shoulders both must have their clothes made to order STOP 
START maris purchases $100 suits from UNK in new york STOP 
START mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at UNK in dallas and pays as much as UNK each STOP 
START light reading neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual UNK henry UNK UNK of cancer STOP 
START mantle so appreciated UNK delicate literary style that he UNK UNK minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips STOP 
START mantle is not normally given to public speaking or for that matter to private speaking STOP 
START what do you and mickey talk about at home reporter asked maris recently STOP 
START to tell you the truth maris said mickey don't talk much STOP 
START this is no surprising UNK for a UNK STOP 
START what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris under constant pressure from writers and UNK are trying to be cooperative STOP 
START of the two mantle is by nature the less UNK maris the more UNK STOP 
START but last week when a reporter was standing near UNK UNK mickey walked up and UNK an UNK STOP 
START see that kid said pointing to a UNK UNK boy STOP 
START that's UNK UNK STOP 
START i'll never forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game STOP 
START i came back sitting by my UNK feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says you UNK STOP 
START maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions UNK and fully but on rare occasions he UNK UNK STOP 
START when i've made a dumb play he says i don't want to talk to anyone STOP 
START i'm angry STOP 
START by his own confession maris is an angry young man STOP 
START UNK at UNK in 1955 he told manager dutch UNK i can't play for you STOP 
START send me where i can play STOP 
START UNK sent him to reading UNK STOP 
START UNK at UNK in 1956 he told manager UNK UNK i'm not learning anything on the bench STOP 
START play me STOP 
START UNK did and maris led the team to victory in the little world series STOP 
START that's the way i am he says STOP 
START i tell people what i think STOP 
START if you're a good UNK you've got to get mad STOP 
START give me a team of nine angry men and i'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times STOP 
START UNK UNK one good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes STOP 
START UNK was UNK williams STOP 
START when i was a kid maris told a UNK last week i used to follow williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not STOP 
START when you came up to the UNK did you seek out williams for advice are you UNK maris STOP 
START you're afraid to talk to a guy you UNK STOP 
START UNK hero was joe UNK STOP 
START when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman an UNK pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver UNK still was playing and every day mickey would go by his UNK just UNK for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his STOP 
START but UNK never said a word STOP 
START it UNK mickey STOP 
START he told me he UNK right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him STOP 
START mantle has kept the UNK STOP 
START among all the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to UNK STOP 
START neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else STOP 
START if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for $1 an hour paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would lay ties on a railroad track STOP 
START if working in a UNK mine which he once did for UNK cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the yankees mantle would work in a UNK mine STOP 
START but since UNK and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate on baseball STOP 
START they try to play baseball the best they can STOP 
START each is a complete UNK STOP 
START mantle beyond any question can do more things well STOP 
START one of the reasons they get along fine says a UNK who is friendly with the two men is that both realize mantle is UNK above maris STOP 
START hitting mantle has an immediate advantage because he UNK both UNK and UNK maris only UNK STOP 
START they both possess near classic UNK dug in firmly arms high set for UNK UNK STOP 
START mantle is considerably better hitting for average fourth in the league to for maris so far this year STOP 
START both are good UNK maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor UNK is a master at dragging a UNK toward first base STOP 
START both have brilliant speed mantle was UNK from home plate batting UNK to first base in UNK seconds faster than any other major UNK ran the UNK dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against UNK UNK the swift UNK UNK of the white sox STOP 
START both are good daring UNK mantle covers more ground throwing arm is stronger STOP 
START yet with all their skills the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic the home run STOP 
START with this ultimate weapon the two yankees may have saved baseball from its UNK season STOP 
START american league expansion created inevitably UNK teams STOP 
START only two teams in each league the yankees and detroit the UNK and UNK are UNK for first place STOP 
START UNK the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at UNK lowest moment STOP 
START in 1920 as the startling news that the UNK white sox had UNK to lose the world series UNK out fans grew UNK and UNK in baseball STOP 
START something was needed to UNK interest something was the home run STOP

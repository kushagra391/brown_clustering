START that's a peculiar way to think STOP 
START it wasn't just the UNK birds that had UNK her own feathers of course knew that STOP 
START it was UNK little sister myra the UNK UNK forever UNK myra STOP 
START she's a year older than i am lucy told herself STOP

START obviously susan was not STOP 
START upstairs busy feet UNK like UNK UNK around her room STOP

START not yet STOP 
START every UNK in the house must be going with her STOP 
START she'd better step on it STOP 
START it's a long way to UNK STOP 
START UNK fine young face was an UNK one too he looked at her it registered anxiety STOP 
START you know he said STOP

START darling she said and the single word UNK love and UNK in an equal UNK STOP 
START she should have told me herself STOP 
START and will it be only a couple of weeks what happened the last time cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit she had stayed all winter and cathy had stayed all winter too with them STOP 
START lucy suspected that myra would never have come home if UNK UNK husband hadn't gone out to UNK her STOP 
START that was an UNK long two weeks STOP 
START for an otherwise silent moment UNK keys UNK UNK in his pocket STOP 
START but she promised this will be different he said at last STOP 
START you've got to admit she was smart to UNK up this fine government job over there UNK get a home for herself and cathy in no time STOP 
START you'll see UNK settling down STOP 
START on the defensive he added i wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without greg to be a new widow a young widow STOP 
START it depends on the widow STOP 
START lucy had an idea that myra loved it STOP 
START and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down STOP 
START it seemed to lucy that all their married life she and jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life STOP 
START remembering that succession of UNK she now considered cathy an ominous UNK on her horizon STOP 
START it was not that she disliked cathy STOP 
START the UNK drew her troubled her depths lucy saw her she tried without noise or UNK to give her the warmth she had never had from myra STOP 
START but cathy was UNK responsibility not hers STOP 
START i wouldn't even be surprised she said UNK if myra tried to leave her with us forever STOP 
START myra loved big cities of miles away in paris of all places she might forget she had ever been a mother STOP 
START lucy knew her too well to find it impossible STOP 
START that's a horrible thing to UNK her of was so UNK it was obvious that no matter what he said he too had seen the UNK UNK of a UNK STOP 
START he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up UNK susan moving startled UNK sound returned STOP 
START don't UNK at susan lucy said STOP 
START was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the UNK river arms around each other they had been talking of the present and the future talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as UNK in light as the air around them STOP 
START then from within the still sleeping house the telephone had UNK with her news was on the other end of the line STOP 
START jim turned back from the UNK and looked at her STOP 
START his dark UNK which had been lowered in anger UNK STOP 
START please he said STOP 
START there isn't a chance of UNK letting anything like that happen STOP 
START let's stay friends STOP 
START but they weren't just friends lucy thought were husband and wife and myra had no right UNK and UNK their marriage STOP 
START the only thing that had ever come between them was that UNK UNK sister of his STOP 
START lucy was sick of it STOP 
START well at last she said because susan was UNK down the stairs STOP 
START susan looked like an UNK baby nurse arms were UNK with a burden of dolls STOP 
START i'm ready she announced STOP 
START do you need that big bundle said STOP 
START his voice had sharp edges as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment STOP 
START all that UNK stared at him with hurt blue eyes that UNK an instant UNK her each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart STOP 
START now now lucy said approaching susan with a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START your father didn't mean it susan STOP 
START she gave jim a quick UNK look of warning STOP 
START UNK take every one of them STOP 
START jim UNK but he lifted UNK suitcase and said in a UNK tone sure the entire thousand STOP 
START and when you get back from UNK cathy will be here to play with you STOP 
START nice no susan said UNK with her UNK UNK of dolls with a UNK effect STOP 
START and at this point lucy thought there should be a lecture on little UNK sharing dolls but she could UNK with susan ought to be a limit to sharing too STOP 
START that was one more reason she didn't look forward to UNK visit short or long last one had been a UNK war STOP 
START she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had STOP 
START well jim said out of the silence let's get going dolls and all STOP 
START when the car with UNK hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust STOP 
START the day was brilliant around her UNK UNK with breeze yet her inner turmoil UNK it STOP 
START she had let jim go with a UNK UNK a UNK kiss STOP 
START she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their life together had she done that STOP 
START she turned and began to walk toward the house STOP 
START at the feeding station the UNK group of UNK again UNK and UNK over the ground but now UNK among them was a beautiful red cardinal UNK in its UNK UNK STOP 
START the handsome bird was solitary mate must be at home silently UNK their nest STOP 
START she had better stay there lucy thought UNK female UNK took instant advantage of UNK without UNK STOP 
START well lucy said to herself UNK the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START she had a day of things to do them she had to prepare the guest room STOP 
START how long would it be occupied wondered with a UNK feeling of UNK STOP 
START as long as the UNK myra chose a moment her mind returned again to the strange flying world of birds and she said to herself STOP 
START it isn't only birds that UNK their children in other people's UNK STOP 
START in the UNK of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready guest room STOP 
START there were new yellow UNK bright as a child's life ought to be a new UNK lively with UNK UNK and hanging from the ceiling was an UNK mother UNK mobile spinning slowly in the breeze STOP 
START a row of little UNK waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet myra had always put most of UNK money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed STOP 
START the closet was UNK UNK with UNK and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind like a UNK ghost UNK house on the day he was buried and the child pale silent UNK watching the funeral guests with UNK eyes STOP 
START many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her STOP 
START out in the hall the upstairs phone UNK and the small ghost vanished STOP 
START when she picked up the receiver her mother's UNK voice was there STOP 
START UNK UNK calling she said STOP 
START i just thought i'd let you know STOP 
START myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left susan a few hours ago STOP 
START i'd have UNK sooner but i've been busy STOP 
START i can imagine was an active character mother to be able to call susan must be UNK now surrounded by her UNK of dolls STOP 
START lucy drew out the chair and sat down relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her STOP 
START you could think yourself as grown up as UNK yet the UNK voice still kept its UNK magic STOP 
START how was cathy UNK STOP 
START but myra was the UNK widow i ever saw STOP 
START on her way to the airport on her way to paris you bet lucy said to herself STOP 
START i've been fixing up the guest room for cathy STOP 
START there was a UNK pause and then her mother said how long is she supposed to stay just for a couple of weeks till myra finds a place for them STOP 
START well this time there was a long silence while the telephone UNK UNK with a UNK life STOP 
START puzzled lucy stared at the UNK UNK mother was UNK was not usually given to mysterious UNK STOP 
START was she thinking along the same lines lucy was that it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good you mean once myra gets to paris the soft pretty UNK found the bright light she had always wanted UNK lucy asked mother do you know something i don't know there was that curious pause and then her mother said i guess i do STOP 
START just before myra left she was saying UNK to cathy and she didn't realize i was near STOP 
START she hesitated as though hunting over words and ways of putting them STOP 
START cathy was in tears of course and i heard myra say now be good and at UNK i'll send you a wonderful present from paris STOP 
START shocked UNK lucy sat there STOP 
START then she jumped to her feet the UNK phone UNK UNK like a black snake STOP 
START UNK then it was no UNK she had dreamed up was only too true STOP 
START myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in two weeks STOP 
START for a moment anger UNK the UNK about her and when she found her voice anger UNK it STOP 
START that does it said STOP 
START i'll keep cathy for two weeks STOP 
START then if myra does nothing about UNK her i'll pack her right back to her mother if i have to take her myself hand UNK on the receiver STOP 
START and that's what i'm going to tell jim STOP 
START for lucy the day's UNK UNK had come to an abrupt end STOP 
START as she hung up she saw through the UNK open window the UNK flying of the UNK wings and heard their UNK singing STOP 
START UNK myra not going to get away with it STOP 
START cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the path STOP 
START the child's thin legs were UNK STOP 
START she UNK along slowly both hands UNK a tired UNK bear STOP 
START she was at the moment just a small walking package being delivered to her UNK and UNK house STOP 
START unlike susan she was traveling light worn UNK bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were all she had STOP 
START lucy UNK at the UNK case knew there would not be enough in it for the UNK of UNK would have to buy things for her STOP 
START she opened the door STOP

START in the midwest oxidation UNK are used UNK for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas STOP 
START the high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive UNK have created the need for a UNK treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume STOP 
START research at UNK missouri on oxidation UNK has shown that the bod in the treated effluent varied from 30 to UNK mg with UNK from 8 to UNK UNK STOP 
START since experience indicates that UNK from oxidation UNK do not create major problems at these bod UNK the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation UNK STOP 
START recent studies by UNK and UNK had indicated that a UNK aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer STOP 
START their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 UNK of oxygen UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK and UNK discussed the use of UNK UNK for treating organic UNK STOP 
START they indicated that a UNK retention UNK lagoon would give 60 to UNK per cent bod reduction STOP 
START later UNK increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and UNK per cent in the summer months STOP 
START it appeared from the limited information available that the UNK lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation UNK as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume STOP 
START red bridge subdivision with the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansas city missouri the UNK was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal STOP 
START the sewage system from kansas city was not expected to serve the red bridge area for several years STOP 
START this necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 aj STOP 
START for the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in figure 1 STOP 
START the oxidation pond has a surface area of UNK acres and a depth of 4 aj STOP 
START the pond is currently serving UNK persons or UNK persons per UNK STOP 
START in the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely UNK and UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START it was possible to maintain UNK conditions in the pond by regular UNK of sodium UNK until the temperature UNK and the UNK population changed from UNK to green UNK STOP 
START the UNK conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium UNK STOP 
START at the same time further expansion in the red bridge subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities STOP 
START the large land areas required for oxidation UNK made this type of treatment UNK UNK to the UNK STOP 
START it was proposed that UNK UNK be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation UNK and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development STOP 
START pilot lagoon the lack of adequate data on the UNK lagoon system UNK the UNK to construct an UNK lagoon pilot plant to determine its UNK for treating domestic sewage STOP 
START the pilot plant was a circular lagoon UNK UNK in UNK at the surface and 65 UNK in UNK at the bottom 4 UNK below the surface with a volume of UNK aj STOP 
START the side UNK were UNK with UNK UNK UNK with UNK to prevent UNK STOP 
START the pilot lagoon was located as shown in figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area STOP 
START the major UNK was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed STOP 
START the pilot lagoon was designed to handle the UNK from UNK persons with a UNK UNK period STOP 
START initially the UNK would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an UNK period STOP 
START this operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly increasing load over a reasonable period of time STOP 
START the pilot plant was equipped with a UNK UNK aerator figure 2 STOP 
START the aerator had a UNK drive to permit operation through a range of speeds STOP 
START the sewage flow into the treatment plant was UNK and continuously recorded on UNK UNK STOP 
START the raw sewage was introduced directly under the UNK aerator to insure maximum UNK of the raw sewage with the UNK tank contents STOP 
START the effluent was collected through two UNK and UNK to the blue river through a surface drainage UNK STOP 
START analyses composite samples were collected at weekly intervals STOP 
START the long retention period and the complete UNK concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent STOP 
START weekly samples would make any changes more readily UNK than daily samples STOP 
START the composite samples were normally collected over a UNK period but an occasional UNK composite was made STOP 
START examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the UNK composite samples with UNK operations STOP 
START the data indicated that the organic load during the UNK UNK was essentially 50 per cent of the UNK organic load STOP 
START grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions STOP 
START efforts were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a UNK composite sample STOP 
START a single UNK composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical STOP 
START pilot plant operations the bod of the UNK to the pilot plant varied between UNK and UNK mg with an average of UNK aj STOP 
START this was equivalent to UNK mg on a UNK basis STOP 
START the bod of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision STOP 
START the bod in the effluent averaged UNK mg a UNK reduction over the UNK period STOP 
START examination of the data in table 1 shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent aj STOP 
START the periods of high effluent bod occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted STOP 
START ice caused the aerator to UNK UNK the drive UNK STOP 
START the UNK of the drive UNK caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the UNK of the raw sewage STOP 
START the organic loading on the unit averaged 32 UNK of bod or about 2 UNK bod UNK UNK UNK capacity STOP 
START needless to say the organic load was very low on a UNK basis but was UNK UNK bod on a surface loading basis STOP 
START it seems that the UNK lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded UNK UNK system STOP 
START the flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in table 1 STOP 
START with the spring UNK the flow rose rapidly due to UNK in open UNK STOP 
START as construction UNK the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced STOP 
START the retention period in the UNK lagoon ranged from UNK to UNK days UNK UNK days STOP 
START the large amount of UNK UNK from the UNK store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem STOP 
START the vegetables were not readily UNK by the UNK in the UNK unit and tended to UNK on the surface STOP 
START a UNK device at the effluent UNK prevented loss of most of these light solids STOP 
START the average UNK suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mg while UNK averaged UNK mg UNK suspended solids STOP 
START the average UNK age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be UNK days STOP 
START the oxygen UNK rate in the mixed liquor averaged UNK mg during the first four months of this study STOP 
START variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased UNK and increased oxygen demand STOP 
START the increase in oxygen UNK rates from UNK to UNK mg which followed an increase in UNK speed was believed to be related to UNK of solids which had settled at the lower UNK speeds STOP 
START it appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active UNK solids with the heavier less active solids settling out STOP 
START the suspended solids UNK in the effluent were found to be the major source of the aj STOP 
START removal of the suspended solids by a UNK UNK yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mg aj STOP 
START the bod in the drainage UNK receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 aj STOP 
START this low bod was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by UNK since the only UNK was surface UNK which was very low during this study STOP 
START UNK examination routine UNK UNK were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by UNK and UNK for the various types of UNK STOP 
START it was found that the UNK lagoon was an UNK UNK system rather than an oxidation pond STOP 
START at no time were UNK found in the mixed liquor STOP 
START the UNK formed typical UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK particles were all small as the heavier UNK settled out STOP 
START initially the UNK UNK UNK but they soon gave way to the free swimming UNK UNK STOP 
START as the temperature UNK the number of free swimming UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START very little UNK activity existed below UNK STOP 
START when the temperature reached UNK all UNK activity ceased as the temperature rose the numbers of UNK increased rapidly STOP 
START only once were UNK UNK found in the mixed liquor STOP 
START the UNK of free swimming UNK UNK is UNK of a high bacterial population STOP 
START oxygen transfer one of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator STOP 
START routine UNK were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen UNK rates STOP 
START the data given in table 2 show the routine operation of the aerator STOP 
START the dissolved oxygen in the UNK unit was consistently high until january 29 1961 STOP 
START an extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water STOP 
START the added resistance to the UNK UNK the drive UNK and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity STOP 
START it was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and UNK but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen STOP 
START a series of eight special tests were conducted at different UNK speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate STOP 
START five of the tests were conducted with a UNK cover to UNK an ice cover STOP 
START the rate of oxygen transfer at UNK l. dissolved oxygen concentration and UNK for various UNK speeds is given in table 3 STOP 
START the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at UNK mg dissolved oxygen was calculated as UNK UNK at a maximum rate of UNK aj STOP 
START the actual power requirements indicated 2 lb. oxygen transfer UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the UNK rather than through the surface STOP 
START oxidation pond during this study UNK conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice UNK STOP 
START shortly after this study ended UNK conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium UNK STOP 
START the location of the oxidation pond in a UNK residential area makes odor UNK a sensitive problem for the UNK STOP 
START the organic concentration in the UNK raw sewage ranged from UNK to UNK mg of bod with an average of UNK aj STOP 
START the bod data are given in table 4 STOP 
START a single UNK composite sample had a bod of UNK mg indicating a typical domestic sewage STOP 
START the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged UNK UNK giving a retention period of 42 days STOP 
START the organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60 lb. bod day UNK STOP 
START the effluent bod averaged 34 mg a little lower than that of the study at UNK indicated for a loading of 60 lb. aj STOP 
START the bod of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of UNK mg. l. STOP 
START UNK examination of the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the UNK began to decrease with cold weather STOP 
START when the UNK began to build up again the effluent bod rose STOP 
START during the two weeks when the UNK disappeared from the effluent UNK in the effluent were 18 and 16 aj STOP

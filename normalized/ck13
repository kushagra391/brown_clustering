START eugene was in his UNK and dressing gown and on his large feet he wore yellow turkish UNK that turned up at the toes STOP 
START excuse me he said in UNK english and got up and left them to UNK and dress STOP 
START the first UNK ring of the telephone brought harold out into the hall STOP

START one of the UNK UNK was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and UNK which seemed to be UNK in brown or UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK were of the same material and there were some big oil paintings UNK in the style of UNK and UNK STOP 
START though taken individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment as a whole formed a UNK STOP

START the UNK called out to them as they were passing through the UNK STOP 
START her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and her small front room was UNK with heavy furniture a big round oak dining table and chairs a UNK with a row of UNK letters inserted between the mirror and its frame STOP 
START the UNK had come while they were out and had been put in their room the UNK said STOP 
START he waited until they were inside the elevator and then said now what do we do call the UNK i guess STOP 
START i guess STOP 
START rather than sit around waiting for the UNK to be delivered they had gone UNK STOP 
START they went to the UNK market expecting to find the UNK of europe and found instead a UNK of that long double row of UNK in UNK STOP 
START cheap clothing and UNK of every sort as far as the eye could see STOP 
START they looked even so STOP 
START looked at everything STOP 
START UNK bought some cotton UNK and harold bought UNK STOP 
START they had lunch at a sidewalk cafe UNK the intersection of two broad busy UNK streets and coming home they got lost in the UNK took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed in order to take the line that went to the place UNK STOP 
START it was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the UNK STOP 
START when he opened the door there stood eugene on his way out of the apartment STOP 
START he was wearing UNK and shorts and an UNK shirt and in his hand he carried a little black bag STOP 
START he did not explain where he was going and they did not ask STOP 
START instead they went on down the hall to their room STOP 
START do you think he could be having an affair asked as they heard the front door close STOP 
START oh no harold said shocked STOP 
START well this is france after all STOP 
START i know but there must be some other explanation STOP 
START he's probably spending the evening with friends STOP 
START and for that he needs a little bag went shopping in the neighborhood and bought two UNK of bread with the UNK UNK they had been given in UNK and some UNK and a dozen eggs and a bag of UNK from a UNK in the place UNK the first UNK they had seen since they landed STOP 
START they had UNK sitting in front of a cafe STOP 
START when they got home harold was grateful for the UNK in the apartment and thought how under different circumstances they might have stayed on here in these UNK UNK rooms that reminded him of the UNK apartment in the east UNK STOP 
START they could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days STOP 
START he went down the hall to UNK bathroom to turn on the UNK heater and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue UNK swimming UNK STOP 
START he felt them STOP 
START they were damp STOP 
START he reached out and felt the bath UNK hanging on the UNK UNK over the tub STOP 
START damp also STOP 
START he looked around the room and then called out come here quick what is it asked standing in the doorway STOP 
START i've solved the mystery of the little bag STOP 
START there it is and there is what was in it STOP 
START but where do people go swimming in paris boat in the river maybe STOP 
START what boat there's a big boat UNK near the place de la UNK with a swimming pool in it didn't you notice it if he has time to go swimming he had time to be with us STOP 
START she looked at him in surprise STOP 
START i know he said reading her mind STOP 
START i don't know what i'm going to do with you STOP 
START it's because we are in france he said and know so few people STOP 
START so something like this matters more than it would at home STOP 
START also he was so nice when he was nice STOP 
START all because i didn't feel like dancing STOP 
START i don't think it was that really STOP 
START then what was it i don't know STOP 
START i wish i did STOP 
START the UNK coat maybe STOP 
START the thing about eugene is that he's very proud STOP 
START and the thing about hurt feelings the wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be STOP 
START for instance what about all those people harold UNK went toward UNK as if this were the one moment they would ever have together their one chance of knowing each other the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields STOP 
START and in any case answers may clarify but they do not change anything STOP

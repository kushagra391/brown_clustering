START after only eighteen years of UNK there were already indications of UNK though in a slight degree to be sure STOP 
START there were more indications by the UNK century STOP 
START i leave it to the UNK to say what they were but i noticed several a few years ago during an automobile ride from UNK to UNK STOP 
START in town after town my companion pointed out the negro school and the white school and in every instance the former made a better appearance it was newer for one thing STOP 
START it really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by UNK t. washington had been going on STOP 
START but with the UNK of interference in 1954 as with its beginning in UNK the improvement was UNK STOP 
START for over a hundred years southerners have felt that the north was picking on them STOP 
START it's UNK this feeling that one is being picked on continually constantly STOP 
START by what right of superior virtue southerners ask do the people of the north do this traditional strategy of the south has been to UNK the UNK of the north to demonstrate that the north possessed no superior virtue to show the world that as UNK UNK UNK said to his UNK however bad i may be you're not quite the people to say it STOP 
START in the UNK war years the south argued that the slave was not less UNK treated than the factory worker of the north STOP 
START at the present time the UNK takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of integration in the north than in the south STOP 
START the line is a pretty good one STOP 
START people talk about the law of the land STOP 
START the expression has become quite a UNK STOP 
START but people can't be made to UNK UNK the two are UNK by southern standards by law STOP 
START i was having lunch not long ago UNK to n. v. UNK with three distinguished historians one UNK in the european middle ages one in american history and one in the far east and i asked them if they could name instances where the general UNK had been radically changed with deliberate speed UNK UNK francis UNK words for the UNK of UNK pursuit by judicial fiat STOP 
START they didn't seem to be able to think of any STOP 
START a virginia judge a while back cited a roman UNK to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change STOP 
START but i suspect that the old roman was referring to change made under military occupation the sort of change which UNK was talking about when he said they make a desert and call it peace UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START moreover the law of the land is not UNK can be changed has been many times STOP 
START mr. justice UNK UNK scott decision in UNK was UNK in the north and soon became a dead letter STOP 
START prohibition was the law of the land but it was UNK how many of us UNK took up drinking in prohibition days drinking was so gay so fashionable especially in the sophisticated northeast and was UNK STOP 
START the UNK loses its UNK virtue in the light of a little history STOP 
START the declaration of independence says that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed STOP 
START the phrase consent of the governed needs a hard look STOP 
START how do we define it the consent of the governed a numerical majority dealt with this question in his UNK on government STOP 
START to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority UNK developed his theory of UNK majority which he said by giving to each portion of the community which may be UNK affected by the action of government a negative on the others UNK all partial or local legislation STOP 
START who will say that our country is even now a UNK community regional UNK do not still exist the court order does not UNK affect the southern region will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action is UNK with the UNK concept of the consent of the governed alter cases STOP 
START a friend of mine in new mexico said the court order had caused no particular trouble out there that all had gone as UNK as a marriage bell STOP 
START he seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere STOP 
START i murmured something about a possible difference between new UNK history and UNK STOP 
START one can meet with UNK almost anywhere the UNK viewpoint it doesn't affect us liberals there are a good many especially if they're rich often exhibit UNK UNK STOP 
START the trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything STOP 
START you've already sent your daughter to miss UNK select academy for girls and your son to mr. UNK select academy for boys and you can be as liberal as you please with strict UNK STOP 
START if there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood there's always new england STOP 
START new england UNK welcome UNK from the provinces south as well as west STOP 
START they may even UNK a colored student or two for show though he usually turns out to be from UNK or any place other than the american south STOP 
START it would be interesting to know how much integration there is in the famous fashionable colleges and UNK schools of new england STOP 
START a recent newspaper report said there were five negroes in the 1960 UNK class of nearly one thousand at yale is about UNK of one per cent which looks pretty UNK to me especially in an institution which UNK to be national STOP 
START i must confess that i prefer the liberal who is personally affected who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith STOP 
START i leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children the question of what their best interests really are STOP 
START i'm talking about the grand manner of the liberal north and south who is not affected personally STOP 
START if these people were denied a voice do they have a moral right to a voice what voices would be left is involved UNK UNK after everybody has followed the new england pattern of UNK one's children into private schools only the poor folks are left STOP 
START and it is precisely in this UNK economic class that one finds and has always found the most racial friction STOP 
START a dear respected friend of mine who like myself grew up in the south and has spent many years in new england said to me not long ago i can't forgive new england for UNK all UNK STOP 
START being a teacher of american literature i remembered UNK massachusetts to virginia where he said but that one dark UNK burden ye must UNK with alone and UNK the bitter harvest which ye UNK have UNK STOP 
START there is a legend UNK records it in his english UNK STOP 
START and one finds it again in thomas nelson page to the effect that the UNK on its second voyage brought a UNK of negro slaves STOP 
START whether historically a fact or not the legend has a certain symbolic value STOP 
START UNK is an embarrassing word STOP 
START it is something which most of us try to get out from under STOP 
START like the cowboy in stephen UNK blue hotel we run around crying well i didn't do anything did i UNK warren puts it this way in brother to UNK the recognition of UNK is the beginning of innocence where innocence i think means about the same thing as UNK STOP 
START a man must be able to say father i have UNK or there is no hope for him STOP 
START lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his second UNK that god gives to both north and south this terrible war as the UNK due to those by whom the UNK came STOP 
START he also spoke of the wealth piled by the UNK two hundred and fifty years in UNK UNK STOP 
START lincoln was historian and UNK enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had UNK in the hands of the UNK of new UNK engaged in the slave trade STOP 
START after how many generations is such wealth mounting all the while through the UNK of high finance UNK of UNK is a question which new UNK long ago put out of their minds STOP 
START but didn't they get off too easy slaves never shared in their profits while they did share in a very real sense in the profits of the UNK they were fed UNK UNK and so forth were the UNK of responsible UNK care STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK sounded a high UNK note in his boston UNK delivered in UNK in the boston music hall UNK UNK applause pay UNK to the owner and fill the bag to the UNK STOP 
START who is the owner slave is owner and ever was STOP 
START pay him is the UNK the UNK of the pure UNK STOP 
START it UNK the UNK financial aspects quite UNK too for his audience who could UNK in moral UNK without visible or even conscious UNK their money from the UNK having been put away long ago in a good UNK UNK STOP 
START like UNK they had washed their hands STOP 
START but can one really god be UNK ever in the long run UNK were a bit sensitive on the subject of their UNK in negro slavery at the time of the UNK of the declaration of independence as jefferson explained in his UNK the UNK UNK the UNK the inhabitants of africa was struck out in UNK to south carolina and georgia who had never attempted to UNK the UNK of slaves and who on the contrary still wished to continue it STOP 
START our northern UNK also i believe felt a little tender under those UNK though their people had very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others STOP 
START but that was a long time ago STOP 
START the new england conscience became UNK STOP 
START george w. UNK UNK new UNK writing in UNK from paradise road UNK lovely symbolic name UNK continuously the southern question STOP 
START it was nice to be able to UNK it STOP 
START new england as everyone knows has long been UNK to the nation STOP 
START there one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities colleges and UNK schools of the united states STOP 
START why should this be so is true that new england more than any other section was dedicated to education from the start STOP 
START but i think that something more than this is involved STOP 
START how did it happen for example that the state university that great symbol of american democracy failed to UNK in new england as it did in other parts of the country it a bit odd that the three states of southern new england massachusetts connecticut and rhode island have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past these institutions having previously been a m colleges it supposed UNK that a m vocational training that is was quite sufficient for the UNK class which UNK that part of the new england world in the UNK war period the UNK having been brought in from southern europe to work in the mills to make up for the labor shortage caused by UNK to the west it not UNK that roger UNK state rhode island should have been the very last of the UNK to establish a state university state universities of UNK new hampshire and vermont are older and more respectable had less UNK to UNK with STOP 
START a yale historian writing a few years ago in the yale review said we in new england have long since segregated our children STOP 
START he was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the UNK schools STOP 
START and what a UNK of those UNK that fair land don't propose to go into their history but i have one or two UNK STOP 
START one is that they were established or gained UNK under pressure provided by these same UNK from whom the old families wished to UNK their children STOP 
START in the early days of a UNK population the public school was quite satisfactory STOP

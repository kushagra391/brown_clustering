START it would have killed you in the cabin STOP 
START do you have anything for me UNK not knowing what b'dikkat meant and the UNK man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head but it isn't big enough for you to take yet STOP 
START mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm STOP 
START b'dikkat had turned to the next UNK of people when the UNK hit mercer STOP 
START he tried to run after b'dikkat to UNK the lead UNK to tell b'dikkat that he loved him STOP 
START he stumbled and fell but it did not hurt STOP 
START the UNK girl lay near him STOP 
START mercer spoke to her STOP 
START isn't it wonderful beautiful beautiful beautiful STOP 
START i'm so happy to be here STOP 
START the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them STOP 
START she UNK warmth and good fellowship STOP 
START mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming STOP 
START he UNK out of his clothes STOP 
START it was foolish and UNK to wear clothing when none of these nice people did STOP 
START the two women UNK and UNK at him STOP 
START with one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing just expressing the UNK of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it STOP 
START with most of his mind he was happy STOP 
START he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this STOP 
START he tried to tell the lady da but the words weren't quite straight STOP 
START a painful UNK hit him in the UNK STOP 
START the drug went after the pain and swallowed it STOP 
START it was like the cap in the hospital only a thousand times better STOP 
START the pain was gone though it had been UNK the first time STOP 
START he forced himself to be deliberate STOP 
START he UNK his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay UNK nude beside him in the desert that was a good UNK STOP 
START maybe i will grow another head STOP 
START that would make b'dikkat happy lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position STOP 
START said she i'm strong too STOP 
START i can talk STOP 
START remember man remember STOP 
START people never live forever STOP 
START we can die too we can die like real people STOP 
START i do so believe in death smiled at her through his happiness STOP 
START of course you can STOP 
START but isn't this nice with this he felt his lips UNK and his mind go UNK STOP 
START he was wide awake but he did not feel like doing anything STOP 
START in that beautiful place among all those UNK and attractive people he sat and smiled STOP 
START b'dikkat was UNK his UNK STOP 
START mercer wondered how long the UNK had lasted him STOP 
START he endured the UNK of the UNK without UNK or movement STOP 
START the UNK of nerves and UNK of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him but meant nothing STOP 
START he watched his own body with remote casual interest STOP 
START the lady da and the UNK woman stayed near him STOP 
START after a long time the UNK dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms STOP 
START having arrived he UNK UNK and UNK at them and UNK back into the UNK UNK from which he had emerged STOP 
START mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and opened them to see stars shining STOP 
START time had no meaning STOP 
START the UNK fed him in their mysterious way drug UNK out his needs for UNK of the body STOP 
START at last he noticed a return of the UNK of pain STOP 
START the pains themselves had not changed had STOP 
START he knew all the events which could take place on UNK STOP 
START he remembered them well from his happy period STOP 
START formerly he had noticed them now he felt them STOP 
START he tried to ask the lady da how long they had had the drug and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again STOP 
START she smiled at him with UNK remote happiness her many UNK stretched out along the ground had a greater capacity for UNK the drug than did his body STOP 
START she meant him well but was in no condition for UNK speech STOP 
START the UNK lay on the ground arteries UNK UNK behind the UNK film which protected his UNK cavity STOP 
START mercer squeezed the man's shoulder STOP 
START the UNK woke recognized mercer and gave him a UNK UNK grin STOP 
START a good UNK to you my boy STOP 
START that's out of a play STOP 
START did you ever see a play you mean a game with cards no said the UNK a sort of UNK with real people doing the figures STOP 
START i never saw that said mercer but i but you want to ask me when b'dikkat is going to come back with the needle STOP 
START yes said mercer a little ashamed of his UNK STOP 
START soon said the UNK STOP 
START that's why i think of plays STOP 
START we all know what is going to happen STOP 
START we all know when it is going to happen STOP 
START we all know what the UNK will do he UNK at the UNK in which the UNK men were UNK and we all know what the new people will ask STOP 
START but we never know how long a scene is going to take STOP 
START what's a scene mercer STOP 
START is that the name for the needle UNK laughed with something close to real humor STOP 
START no no no STOP 
START you've got the UNK on the brain STOP 
START a scene is just a part of a play STOP 
START i mean we know the order in which things happen but we have no UNK and nobody UNK enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here so none of us know how long anything takes STOP 
START the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long STOP 
START i'm inclined to think that they are about two UNK each STOP 
START mercer did not know what an UNK was since he had not been a UNK man before his conviction but he got nothing more from the UNK at that time STOP 
START the UNK received a UNK UNK turned red in the face shouted UNK at mercer take it out you fool it out of me mercer looked on UNK the UNK twisted over on his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and UNK UNK and quietly to himself STOP 
START mercer himself could not tell how long it was before b'dikkat came back STOP 
START it might have been several days STOP 
START it might have been several months STOP 
START once again b'dikkat moved among them like a father again they UNK like children STOP 
START this time b'dikkat smiled UNK at the little head which had grown out of UNK UNK a sleeping child's head covered with light hair on top and with UNK UNK over the resting eyes STOP 
START mercer got the UNK needle STOP 
START when b'dikkat cut the head from UNK UNK he felt the knife UNK against the UNK which held the head to his own body STOP 
START he saw the UNK UNK as the head was cut felt the far cool flash of UNK pain as b'dikkat UNK the wound with a UNK UNK which stopped all bleeding immediately STOP 
START the next time it was two legs growing from his chest STOP 
START then there had been another head beside his own STOP 
START or was that after the UNK and legs waist to UNK of the little girl which had grown from his side forgot the order STOP 
START he did not count time STOP 
START lady da smiled at him often but there was no love in this place STOP 
START she had lost the extra UNK STOP 
START in between UNK she was a pretty and UNK woman the UNK thing about their relationship was her whisper to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and hope people never live forever STOP 
START she found this UNK UNK even though mercer did not make much sense out of it STOP 
START thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived STOP 
START sometimes b'dikkat took the new ones resting in the UNK sleep of their UNK brains in a UNK to be added to other UNK STOP 
START the bodies in the truck UNK and UNK without human speech when the UNK struck them STOP 
START finally mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin STOP 
START he had to fight the UNK of UNK to do it STOP 
START only the memory of previous hurt UNK and UNK made him sure that if he did not ask b'dikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would no longer be available when he needed it STOP 
START fighting pleasure itself he begged b'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there STOP 
START b'dikkat UNK agreed but he did not come out of the doorway STOP 
START he spoke through the public address box built into the cabin and his UNK voice roared out over the empty plain so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend b'dikkat might be wanting to tell them STOP 
START when he said it they thought it UNK profound though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on UNK standard years UNK years seven months three days two hours eleven and one half minutes STOP 
START good luck fellow STOP 
START mercer turned away STOP 
START the secret little corner of his mind which stayed UNK through happiness and pain made him wonder about b'dikkat STOP 
START what persuaded the UNK to remain on UNK kept him happy without UNK b'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded by a family of little UNK UNK himself despite his happiness UNK a little at the strange fate of b'dikkat STOP 
START his own fate he accepted STOP 
START he remembered the last time he had eaten actual eggs from an actual pan STOP 
START the UNK kept him alive but he did not know how they did it STOP 
START he staggered back to the group STOP 
START the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a UNK hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her STOP 
START there were UNK square miles of UNK space around them but he appreciated the UNK of her gesture none the less STOP 
START 4 the years if they were years went by STOP 
START the land of UNK did not change STOP 
START sometimes the UNK sound of UNK came UNK across the plain to the herd of men who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain UNK STOP 
START there was night and day but no setting of crops no change of season no generations of men STOP 
START time stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so UNK with the UNK and pains of the UNK that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning STOP 
START people never live forever STOP 
START her statement was a hope not a truth in which they could believe STOP 
START they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all STOP 
START there was no dream of escape for these people STOP 
START though they saw the UNK chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond UNK cabin they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of UNK flesh STOP 
START far long ago some other UNK than one of these had tried to write a letter STOP 
START his UNK was on a rock STOP 
START mercer read it and so had a few of the others but they could not tell which man had done it STOP 
START nor did they care STOP 
START the letter UNK on stone had been a message home STOP 
START they could still read the opening once i was like you UNK out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in STOP 
START once like you i had one head two hands ten fingers on my hands STOP 
START the front part of my head was called a face and i could talk with it STOP 
START now i can only write and that only when i get out of pain STOP

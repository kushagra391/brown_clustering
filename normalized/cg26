START all of which brings up another problem in the use of UNK insight in a literary work STOP 
START is the oedipus complex the clinical UNK material for a tragedy we remove ourselves for a moment from our time and our UNK with mental disease isn't there something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his UNK UNK am not making a clinical judgment here for such personal UNK are real and are commonplace in the UNK consulting room but literature makes a different claim upon our UNK than tragedy in life STOP 
START a man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood and condemned by unconscious forces within him to UNK repeat his earliest failure in love only makes us a little weary of man tragedy seems UNK and trivial STOP 
START now we can argue that the UNK fate of oedipus UNK was nothing more than the UNK unconscious UNK of oedipus projected UNK but this UNK of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between a story and a clinical case history STOP 
START we can also argue that the three brothers UNK and UNK were the external representatives of an internal conflict within one man UNK a conflict having to do with UNK and the wish to possess the father's woman STOP 
START but a novel in which one man UNK explored the divisions within his personality would scarcely merit publication in the UNK UNK STOP 
START it is a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex as a literary UNK of oedipus UNK STOP 
START whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth an oedipus who is drawn to his fate by UNK external forces can carry the symbol of humanity and its UNK crime and the incest that is UNK UNK the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and UNK us in the secret STOP 
START but a modern oedipus who is UNK because he cannot oppose his own childhood is only UNK and for UNK the mystery in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our UNK STOP 
START i am suggesting that a UNK approach to the oedipus complex is a blind UNK for a UNK STOP 
START the best gifts of the novelist will be wasted on the reader who is UNK against any UNK the novelist may have in store for him STOP 
START incest is still a durable theme but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways to surprise the emotions and there is no better way to do this than that of UNK and symbolic representation STOP 
START and the best way to UNK and UNK the elements of an incest story is not to set out to write an incest story STOP 
START which brings to mind another lawrence story and some interesting UNK in the treatment of the UNK theme STOP 
START the rocking horse UNK is also a story about a boy's love for his mother STOP 
START if i now risk some UNK with sons and UNK let it be clear that i am not UNK the two works or judging their merits am only UNK out differences in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects STOP 
START the rocking horse UNK is a fantasy with extraordinary power to UNK the reader but we do not know why STOP 
START it is the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for his cold and UNK mother STOP 
START there are UNK scenes in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks UNK toward the climax that will UNK give him the name of the winning horse STOP 
START the child grows rich on his UNK and UNK with his uncle to make secret gifts of his money to his mother STOP 
START the story ends in the child's illness and UNK brought on by the UNK UNK to ride his horse to win for his mother STOP 
START the child dies with his UNK mother at his UNK STOP 
START i had read the story many times without asking myself why it affected me or UNK why it did STOP 
START but on one occasion when i encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was my patient i began to understand the UNK effects of this story STOP 
START it was of course a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to himself and UNK the father who could not give her the things she wanted a classical UNK fantasy if you like but if it were only this the story would be UNK STOP 
START why does the story affect us does the rocking exert its UNK effect upon the reader rocking is actually felt in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that UNK the tragedy STOP 
START the rocking i realized is the single element in the story that carries the UNK message the UNK and unconscious UNK that would UNK the innocence of a child's fantasy and UNK the effects of the work if it were made explicit STOP 
START the rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the UNK UNK silent and making it present UNK and yet is UNK perfect symbol STOP 
START and if we understand the rocking as an UNK symbol we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of UNK tragedy STOP 
START for this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden love UNK by its nature STOP 
START we are also struck by the fact that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not UNK while the UNK love of the man paul UNK sometimes UNK STOP 
START it's easy to see why STOP 
START this love belongs to childhood UNK it its place there and in UNK treatment we are given the innocent fantasy of a child in fact the form in which UNK love is expressed in childhood STOP 
START and when the child dies in UNK story in a UNK that is somehow brought on by his UNK to win and to make his mother rich the UNK UNK of such a disease and such a death does not enter into our thoughts at all STOP 
START we have so completely entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the UNK and the necessary conclusion STOP 
START i am sure that none of the effects of this story were consciously employed by lawrence to describe an UNK fantasy in childhood STOP 
START it is most probable that UNK and the oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing of this story STOP 
START he was simply writing a story that wanted to be told and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged STOP 
START he would not have cared why it emerged he only wanted to capture a memory to play with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy STOP 
START in our own time we have seen that the UNK debt to UNK has increased but that the novel itself has not UNK much from this marriage STOP 
START UNK hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last UNK of the novel has only been partially fulfilled STOP 
START the young writer seems UNK by psychological knowledge has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological insights STOP 
START he UNK the insights of psychology to improve his UNK vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision that should be a UNK own STOP 
START he has been UNK by the UNK of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces of character STOP 
START if many of the characters in contemporary novels appear to be the UNK relations of characters in a case history it is because the novelist is often UNK today that those things that we call character UNK themselves in surface behavior that the ego is still the executive agency of personality and that all we know of personality must be UNK through the ego STOP 
START the novelist who has been badly baptized in UNK often gives us the impression that since all men must have an oedipus complex all men must have the same faces STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START i have argued that oedipus of the oedipus complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature STOP 
START but a writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the incest myth the joke that strikes right at the center of man's UNK STOP 
START moral UNK is seen as the other face of desire and here UNK UNK to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity STOP 
START there is probably some significance in the fact that two of the best incest stories i have encountered in recent years are UNK of the incest myth STOP 
START the ancient types are UNK in gloom and UNK to be UNK drawn to their UNK but the myth fails before the modern truth UNK speaks false and the dream speaks true STOP 
START in both the UNK tale in ralph UNK UNK man and in thomas UNK the holy UNK the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting the wish as motive heroic act is the UNK off of UNK STOP 
START thomas UNK wrote the holy UNK in 1951 STOP 
START it was conceived as a UNK a kind of UNK UNK of the UNK of the west UNK die UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START he chose a medieval legend of incest UNK UNK stein and freely borrowed and UNK other UNK of the west UNK UNK language peoples and times in a master myth in which the old forms continually UNK themselves as in his previous treatment of joseph STOP 
START but the holy UNK is not simply a UNK of old stories for an old man's entertainment STOP 
START UNK understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which UNK is shown as the other face as UNK was for him just the kind of deep and complicated joke he liked to tell STOP 
START and when he UNK the legend of UNK he UNK a modern version in which the medieval players speak contemporary thoughts in UNK language they move through the UNK of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through UNK they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the UNK manner STOP 
START UNK is the child of an UNK union between a royal brother and sister the twins UNK and UNK STOP 
START he is born in UNK after the death of his father and cast UNK soon after birth STOP 
START the infant is discovered by a UNK who brings him home to rear him STOP 
START an ivory UNK in the UNK UNK UNK the story of his UNK UNK and is preserved for the child by the UNK of a UNK in the fishing village STOP 
START UNK at seventeen UNK his story and goes forth as a knight to UNK his UNK STOP 
START his sailing vessel is guided by fate to the UNK of his own country at a time when UNK UNK is UNK by the armies of one of her rejected UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK the UNK in battle UNK the city from its UNK and UNK UNK who had fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him STOP 
START UNK is UNK with their second child when she finds the ivory UNK UNK by her husband and the UNK of mother and son are revealed STOP 
START UNK goes off to do UNK on a rock for seventeen years STOP 
START at the end of this period two UNK christians in rome receive the revelation which leads them to seek the next pope on the rock STOP 
START UNK comes to rome and becomes a great and beloved pope STOP 
START in the last pages of the book UNK comes to rome to seek an audience with the great pope and to give her confession STOP 
START mother and son recognize each other and in UNK version of this legend make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of their true UNK from the time they had first set eyes on each other STOP

START before losing itself in the UNK of the UNK century the grand stream of italian renaissance UNK UNK made a last appearance in the brumidi UNK of the capitol UNK in washington STOP 
START the artistic generation after brumidi was trained in the paris of that time to a more UNK standard of execution and tended to UNK greatness of conception where UNK and weakness were easy to find STOP 
START but it is a great conception STOP 
START the open ceiling with UNK and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line of UNK and his baroque followers STOP 
START the descent may be remote but this is surely the only UNK example of that vigorous UNK in the united states STOP 
START UNK brumidi designed the UNK scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect charles u. walter at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of UNK with the present much larger iron structure STOP 
START after many years and many UNK he was able to finish the UNK UNK and slightly less than half the frieze beginning with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william UNK all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career STOP 
START he left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle STOP 
START these were carried out not too UNK by UNK UNK who began by supplying the missing member to the UNK of pennsylvania and noting in pencil in italian that he began at this point STOP 
START when UNK had used up all the sketches UNK feet of empty frieze were left over STOP 
START a blank UNK UNK UNK in UNK UNK the wall of the UNK until 1951 STOP 
START then advised by the architect of the capitol the joint committee for the library UNK responsible for the works of art in the building ordered the space cleared and painted in UNK to show the peace after the civil war the UNK war and the birth of UNK to match as nearly as feasible UNK technique and composition STOP 
START later the cleaning and restoration were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of the UNK STOP 
START what follows is therefore a description of three separate UNK the new UNK of the gap and the successive UNK in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each STOP 
START for the use of students and future UNK a full UNK record was kept of all three UNK complete technical reports on what we found and what we did STOP 
START these may be consulted in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library of congress STOP 
START the first preliminary was UNK the UNK length of frieze a UNK of UNK and finish UNK all in bad condition STOP 
START it was decided to strip the whole area down to the UNK and to replace the rough UNK up to one inch thickness to agree with the older UNK preparation with a mortar one part UNK lime three parts sand to be put on in two UNK STOP 
START UNK were drawn full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities STOP 
START there was some difficulty here STOP 
START one had to manage the given subjects three diverse recent events so as to make them part of a classical frieze that is a pattern of large figures filling the space with not much else against a blank background STOP 
START moreover all three UNK must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length brumidi allowed for each one of his STOP 
START when it was all arranged to fit and not to UNK the UNK flow of movement in the frieze the UNK were tried in place STOP 
START the UNK a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and safe but UNK UNK STOP 
START nothing could be seen from the floor but by moving around the gallery one could get UNK we were able to decide on some UNK of scale STOP 
START to be sure of matching color as well as form pieces of UNK were traced on the UNK and large samples painted in UNK then left two months to dry out to their final key STOP 
START later it was UNK to note that they had set so UNK as to be hard to remove when the time came STOP 
START the UNK was the length of the space to be painted STOP 
START what bits of brumidi and UNK could be reached at either end seemed in good order though the UNK UNK surface was thick with dust STOP 
START washed they came out surprisingly clear and bright STOP 
START it could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch and that both followed the traditional italian UNK technique as described by UNK UNK in the UNK century and current in italy to this day STOP 
START that is they used UNK color throughout getting solid UNK with active lime white STOP 
START painting a UNK is much in evidence STOP 
START a brown UNK UNK and UNK shadows and much of the background is UNK covered with a dark coat STOP 
START this brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint STOP 
START in our own practice to have the last UNK plaster coat thick enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine UNK in drying we found that it had to be put on in two UNK letting the first set UNK before applying the second STOP 
START the mortar was three parts sand to two of lime STOP 
START some of the lime that is always on hand in the capitol basement for plaster UNK was UNK several months for us to make it UNK of a really UNK consistency to avoid cracking we added a little UNK lime hard on the hands but we could see no other UNK STOP 
START i am told that a mortar longer UNK might have remained longer in condition for painting STOP 
START as it was it took the UNK well for six hours enough for our purpose and held it firmly in setting STOP 
START it was obvious that to match brumidi white must be mixed with all but the UNK tones STOP 
START lime white hard and brilliant has a tendency to jump away from the other colors in drying and also by its capacity to set to UNK the use of UNK UNK so useful in UNK work STOP 
START in older italian practice lime dried and UNK UNK UNK entered into such prepared shades STOP 
START for convenience we chose a stronger UNK unknown to the early UNK or to brumidi UNK UNK UNK the active lime white for highest lights put on at the end of the day's UNK STOP 
START other UNK were mostly raw UNK some UNK UNK and a little yellow UNK STOP 
START this last was probably not in UNK UNK but was needed to take the chill UNK look off the new work next to the old where UNK effects of time were seen even after thorough cleaning STOP 
START the use of UNK we tried to restrict to covering joints STOP 
START experience showed however that it is very difficult to paint a dark UNK background in UNK that will not dry out UNK and UNK STOP 
START later brumidi and UNK will be seen UNK with this same problem STOP 
START we were forced as they were to work a good deal of UNK into background and dark areas STOP 
START we made it by UNK UNK five parts thoroughly washed UNK UNK to one of lime UNK together they made a strong UNK which became UNK in drying STOP 
START figure 1 was taken in 1953 STOP 
START the new part is finished STOP 
START on the right is the brumidi liberty group as it looked after cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end of UNK only some foliage has been washed at the point where his work stopped STOP 
START one is led to UNK as to why the empty space was there left for our century to finish STOP 
START UNK said it was UNK fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle STOP 
START UNK son later maintained that UNK had UNK and UNK his father's designs UNK UNK a bit he could claim for his very own STOP 
START this question might be settled by UNK the measurement of the actual UNK with the dimensions noted presumably in UNK hand above the various sections of his long UNK drawing which has been kept STOP 
START UNK fault it is evident that brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his histories and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of california gold STOP 
START in painting a UNK the handling of wet mortar UNK one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right not to UNK UNK work with today's UNK STOP 
START at the very first then brumidi was required by the UNK UNK shape of his central group to fill in the UNK space above the seated girl on UNK right before starting on the UNK figures themselves STOP 
START here he put a small man whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning this was to be the closing figure of the party of UNK and was to hold a basket STOP 
START one sees UNK rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away STOP 
START the photograph figure 1 of the completed frieze shows how having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years he has now been given a hand and by UNK and the permission of the committee given a new job to represent the witnesses of the first flight at UNK hawk in UNK STOP 
START the UNK bright effect of the first UNK led the committee to order the rest of the UNK cycle cleaned and restored to go with them STOP 
START the fixed wooden UNK was removed and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built up from the floor STOP 
START every few days in the early morning as the work progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the UNK foundation that distributed its weight widely on the UNK pavement supported as it is by ancient brick UNK STOP 
START on this UNK and UNK platform over fifty feet from the floor after a first UNK we began to wash STOP 
START a most useful tool for UNK the surface without running down was made from a UNK mist spray UNK UNK to a UNK connection to be used at low water pressure STOP 
START a UNK in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower STOP 
START one man UNK with a UNK in hand to check excess UNK STOP 
START a second assistant UNK with two UNK STOP 
START in parts a repeated UNK was needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to UNK the original brightness STOP 
START no soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in UNK chemical reactions STOP 
START the painting a UNK stood up UNK little of the UNK came off STOP 
START necessary UNK was put on at once STOP 
START altogether we found the UNK first rate especially UNK STOP 
START we were greatly helped by there being no UNK of former UNK STOP 
START apparently not more than UNK had ever been done and not much of that STOP 
START the plaster was sound the UNK firmly attached all over and the UNK UNK incorporated with it in all but a few UNK places STOP 
START the greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly UNK from UNK above UNK the surface and leaving UNK of dissolved lime very UNK even after cleaning particularly in the landing of columbus UNK and the indians and UNK STOP 
START here the architect referring to the use of the capitol as a public building not a museum requested some UNK to maintain UNK effect rather than leaving blank UNK UNK STOP 
START these UNK have had no care for eighty years STOP 
START with naked gas UNK below and UNK windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium they have survived in a building long UNK in winter hot and damp under the iron dome in summer STOP

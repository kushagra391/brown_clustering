START a good man UNK STOP 
START UNK mr. sam STOP 
START sam rayburn was a good man a good american and third a good democrat STOP 
START he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure speaker mr. sam and mr. democrat at one and the same time STOP 
START the house was his habitat and there he UNK first as a young representative then as a UNK committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth speaker of the house and second most powerful man in washington STOP 
START mr. rayburn was not an easy man to UNK or to label STOP 
START he was no UNK liberal yet the new deal the fair deal and the new frontier needed him STOP 
START he was not a UNK conservative yet UNK of that UNK will miss him as much as any STOP 
START two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word STOP 
START sam rayburn took UNK secrets with him to the grave for he was never UNK and his word once given was not subject to UNK STOP 
START it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs STOP 
START the demonstration of his power was never UNK or theatrical STOP 
START his leadership was not for audiences STOP 
START a UNK a nod was usually enough STOP 
START when it was not one of the great UNK of washington would be presented STOP 
START he would rise in the well of the house his chin upon his chest his hands UNK the side of a desk and the political and legislative UNK would UNK into silence STOP 
START he spoke briefly UNK to the point and without UNK UNK STOP 
START he made good plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it STOP 
START these public efforts were rare because mr. rayburn normally did his UNK UNK and UNK long before an issue reached its test on the house floor STOP 
START he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been UNK pointed out to them STOP 
START with his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader STOP 
START he was of course in the house for a very long time STOP 
START there are only two men remaining in congress who with rayburn voted for the declaration of war against germany in UNK STOP 
START to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr. sam UNK with that of the house STOP 
START and it was the house he loved STOP 
START to be UNK officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition STOP 
START the senate to him was not the upper body and he UNK those who said he served under the president STOP 
START he served with him STOP 
START sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death STOP 
START UNK wilson with whom he began his years in washington warren g. UNK UNK coolidge UNK with whom he managed a social revolution STOP 
START and those still with us herbert c. UNK harry s. truman dwight d. eisenhower and john f. kennedy STOP 
START he was a UNK for those of his own party STOP 
START mr. truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr. kennedy with congress would have been UNK than it was had not mr. sam been there STOP 
START as it was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration STOP 
START with republican presidents he fought fair STOP 
START he was his own man not an automatic UNK STOP 
START he kept his attacks on UNK for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game he was born to play STOP 
START under any name mr. speaker mr. democrat mr. sam he was a good man STOP 
START un off the congo track thirteen italian UNK who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations UNK have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends STOP 
START in 18 months no more UNK incident has been reported from that jungle STOP 
START simply out of UNK their UNK UNK the bodies and tossed the remains into the river STOP 
START the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the UNK for belgian mercenaries STOP 
START in other words UNK by UNK wearing the uniform of the central government might be UNK had the victims been serving the cause of UNK katanga STOP 
START does this suggest that the congo is fit for UNK or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it the contrary through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence STOP 
START mass UNK troop UNK UNK UNK and UNK and UNK military adventures given no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily UNK STOP 
START yet this basic condition of UNK and UNK is not the work of katanga STOP 
START it happens in the territory of the UNK government which is itself a fiction UNK incapable of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it STOP 
START the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un UNK its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a UNK in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa STOP 
START right now they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to UNK and UNK katanga STOP 
START that notion is UNK UNK from several points of view STOP 
START the un army is too weak too UNK for the task STOP 
START further it has its work cut out stopping UNK where it is now UNK STOP 
START last it makes no sense to deliver katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos STOP 
START the congo should have been UNK because it was not ready for independence STOP 
START the idea was not even suggested because political UNK UNK over wisdom STOP 
START it is perhaps too late now to talk of UNK because it is UNK with what is termed political realism STOP 
START but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach STOP 
START otherwise un will march UNK on to certain defeat STOP 
START UNK UNK a recent editorial discussing a UNK agreement reached between the southern pacific co. and the order of railroad UNK has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information STOP 
START the editorial was based on a news association UNK which said that the UNK had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 UNK pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year STOP 
START our comment was that this was UNK in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was UNK since it had entered into such an agreement STOP 
START the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some UNK benefit from the UNK but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life STOP 
START additional information supplied to us UNK that the railroad gained a UNK supply of UNK of which it was in need STOP 
START also normal personnel UNK would make the job reduction provision more or less academic STOP 
START the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries STOP 
START the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands STOP 
START UNK from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side STOP 
START but the UNK have taken over the governing body of the bar and when the UNK met in st. louis it was not to UNK about the UNK but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful despite an UNK here and there STOP 
START it was the brief writers decided man's best hope for a peaceful and law UNK world STOP 
START peace it's wonderful and world law it's wonderful too and shouldn't we get an international UNK extending it into space before the russians put some claim UNK on the moon in moscow khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a UNK equal to 100 million tons of UNK to knock sense into the heads of those backward UNK who can't see the justice of UNK west berlin to communism STOP 
START a nuclear UNK of these dimensions roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has UNK UNK would certainly produce a bigger UNK and just for UNK khrushchev might use it to UNK the UNK of the house of delegates from st. louis to the moon where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink STOP 
START while he was at it the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by UNK at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide STOP 
START UNK he UNK what do you think you are doing only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the UNK with our shoes in the united nations but perhaps the heavy UNK in the house of delegates can improve on this UNK effort STOP 
START another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily UNK of an american plane by a UNK UNK with a gun STOP 
START the craft made the familiar UNK flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro rushed to the airport to express UNK to the UNK foreign minister a passenger who is not an UNK of old ten o'clock shadow STOP 
START the plane was sent back to the united states for a change but castro kept the crazy UNK who will prove a suitable UNK to the revolution STOP 
START less respect for the legal UNK was displayed by UNK right hand man UNK UNK who UNK the UNK economic and social council meeting in UNK by reading two secret american documents UNK from the united states embassy at UNK UNK STOP 
START the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid UNK STOP 
START perhaps the UNK of world law are not advanced by UNK american diplomatic papers and planes but the kennedy administration can always file a UNK to the effect that but for its own UNK in UNK american interests these things would not happen STOP 
START the same can be said about the UNK cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april which we trust is not UNK of the methods to be UNK in holding off the UNK khrushchev STOP 
START pass the iron UNK please and light another candle for it's getting dark down here and we're UNK to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away STOP 
START the customer loses again STOP 
START the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain as they had planned to do this month STOP 
START the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a UNK UNK car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional smaller car STOP 
START by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to UNK and UNK lines STOP 
START the UNK action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex UNK of UNK laws STOP

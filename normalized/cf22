START in UNK county UNK near the river UNK there is a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen which means garden of owen STOP 
START undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on american military history or the UNK of UNK that have been done in its name STOP 
START the cry garryowen from the lips of a UNK cavalry UNK was the last sound heard on this earth by UNK numbers of UNK UNK and UNK mexican UNK under UNK UNK japanese in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communists in korea STOP 
START garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th u.s. cavalry regiment the fighting seventh STOP 
START today a battle cry may seem an UNK for in the modern army UNK de corps has been UNK to UNK UNK and tables STOP 
START but don't tell that to a veteran of the fighting seventh especially in a saloon on saturday night STOP 
START of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th UNK perhaps no one knows its spirit better than lieutenant colonel UNK c. chandler STOP 
START UNK and UNK with steel blue eyes and a chest UNK with UNK chandler is the UNK of the UNK UNK STOP 
START the truth is however that when UNK chandler first reported to the regiment the only UNK he had ever UNK was a UNK chair and the only weapon he had ever UNK was a pencil STOP 
START chandler had been UNK in the medical service corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decided that if he was going to make the army his career he wanted to be in the fighting part of it STOP 
START though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer he managed to get transferred to the combat forces STOP 
START the next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of troop h 7th cavalry in the middle of corps UNK in japan STOP 
START outside of combat he couldn't have landed in a UNK spot STOP 
START first of all no unit likes to have a new UNK brought in from the outside especially when he's an UNK UNK STOP 
START second if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him it's on UNK STOP 
START in combat helping your UNK make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed STOP 
START but in UNK with the top brass watching him all the time it's easy STOP 
START chandler understood this and expected the worst STOP 
START but his first few days with troop h were full of UNK beginning with first sergeant robert early STOP 
START chandler had expected a tough old UNK with a UNK voice STOP 
START instead sergeant early was quiet sharp and confident STOP 
START he had enlisted in the army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade STOP 
START there was no weapon early could not take apart and UNK UNK STOP 
START he could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work STOP 
START further he had taken full advantage of the UNK correspondence courses STOP 
START he not only knew UNK but mathematics history and literature as well STOP 
START but for all his UNK confidence sergeant early was right out of the garryowen mold STOP 
START he was filled with the spirit of the fighting seventh STOP 
START that saved UNK chandler STOP 
START sergeant early let the new UNK know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the united states army STOP 
START he fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment STOP 
START for example it was a UNK of the 7th cavalry under colonel george UNK UNK that had been wiped out at the battle of the little big horn STOP 
START it didn't take captain chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of troop aj STOP 
START but what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer UNK and UNK was ready and willing to help him carry it for the good of the troop and the regiment STOP 
START UNK over the 7th returned to UNK duty in tokyo captain chandler still with them STOP 
START it was the 7th cavalry whose UNK were charged with UNK the imperial palace of the emperor STOP 
START but still UNK chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a UNK word garryowen STOP 
START the final proof was a small incident STOP 
START it happened at the st. UNK day party a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over UNK of a century to the UNK of an irish march STOP 
START in the middle of the party chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him each UNK above the biggest UNK UNK he had ever seen STOP 
START the faces belonged to lieutenant UNK UNK his wife and their two children STOP 
START and when the singing began it was the UNK who sang the old irish songs the best STOP 
START though there was an occasional UNK UNK about UNK UNK the jewish officer from chicago singing UNK about the UNK UNK no one really thought it was strange STOP 
START for UNK UNK like UNK UNK the UNK boy who carried UNK last message or UNK UNK the UNK army on UNK was a garryowen through and through STOP 
START it was no coincidence that UNK was one of the most beloved UNK leaders in the regiment STOP 
START and so UNK chandler got the spirit of garryowen STOP 
START he set out to keep troop h the best troop in the best regiment STOP 
START one of his UNK was to see to it that every man cook and clerk as well as UNK qualified with every weapon in the troop STOP 
START even the mess sergeant bill brown a UNK UNK transfer from an UNK division went out on the range STOP 
START the troop received a new leader lieutenant robert m. carroll fresh out of UNK and UNK for regular army status STOP 
START carroll was sharp and military but he was up against tough competition for that UNK UNK and he wanted to play it cool STOP 
START so UNK chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of garryowen just as he himself had been sold a short time before STOP 
START when the korean war began on june 25 1950 the anniversary of the day UNK had gone down fighting at the little big horn and the day the regiment had UNK the UNK of UNK during world war 2 the 7th cavalry was not in the best fighting condition STOP 
START its entire complement of UNK officers on the UNK level had UNK as UNK for another unit and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across UNK in world war 2 STOP 
START just a month after the korean war broke out the 7th cavalry was moving into the lines ready for combat STOP 
START from then on the fighting seventh was in the thick of the UNK fighting in korea STOP 
START one night on the UNK river UNK chandler called on that UNK UNK de corps STOP 
START the regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the north UNK were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side STOP 
START the UNK knew an attack was coming but they didn't know when and they didn't know where STOP 
START at 6 o'clock on the morning of august 12 they were in doubt no longer STOP 
START then it came against troop aj STOP 
START the enemy had UNK across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men armed with russian machine guns attacked the position held by UNK men STOP 
START they came in waves STOP 
START first came the UNK UNK UNK UNK being driven into death as a massive human UNK UNK STOP 
START they were followed by crack north korean troops who mounted one charge after another STOP 
START they UNK the 7th UNK forward UNK positions through sheer weight of numbers over UNK of their own dead STOP 
START another force UNK the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear STOP 
START captain chandler saw that it was building up strength STOP 
START he assembled a group of 25 men composed of wounded UNK UNK UNK the company clerk supply men UNK and drivers and led them to the hill STOP 
START one of the more seriously wounded was lieutenant carroll the young officer UNK for the regular army STOP 
START chandler left carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any UNK he could find to the fight STOP 
START then UNK chandler started up the hill STOP 
START he took one step two broke into a trot and then into a run STOP 
START the first thing he knew the words garryowen from his throat STOP 
START his followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill firing as they ran STOP 
START the UNK fell back but UNK at the top of the hill and UNK down the UNK with a screen of fire STOP 
START chandler looking to right and left to see how his men were UNK suddenly saw another figure UNK up the hill UNK UNK and UNK the battle cry as he ran STOP 
START it was bob carroll who had suddenly found himself UNK with the spirit of garryowen STOP 
START he had formed his own task force of three UNK and led them up the hill in a fighting seventh charge STOP 
START because of this UNK attack the main group that had been UNK down on the hill was able to UNK forward again STOP 
START but an enemy UNK hit carroll in the head and UNK simultaneously STOP 
START he went down like a wet UNK and the UNK hit the dirt in the face of the UNK enemy fire STOP 
START enemy UNK came UNK down seeking a soft spot STOP 
START they found it at the UNK between troops h and g and prepared to UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK saw what was happening STOP 
START he turned to his UNK STOP 
START okay men he said STOP 
START follow me STOP 
START UNK leaped to his feet and started forward garryowen his lips his men following STOP 
START but the bullets UNK home before he finished his battle cry and UNK UNK fell dead STOP 
START for an instant his men hesitated unable to believe that their lieutenant the most popular officer in the regiment was dead STOP 
START then they let out a UNK of UNK and rage and UNK screaming and UNK garryowen charged into the enemy like wild men STOP 
START that finished the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll had begun STOP 
START UNK UNK pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack STOP 
START UNK came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by UNK UNK STOP 
START the north UNK threw away their guns and fled across the rice UNK STOP 
START artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds STOP 
START though bob carroll seemed to have had his head practically UNK off by the UNK UNK he lived STOP 
START today he is a major in the regular army STOP 
START so filled was UNK chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea was over he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment STOP 
START after years of UNK nights and UNK he put together the big UNK illustrated book of garryowen and glory which is probably the most complete history of any military unit STOP 
START the battle of the UNK river is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fighting seventh have paid off STOP 
START for nearly a century the cry has never failed to UNK the fighting men of the regiment STOP 
START take the case of major UNK a. UNK who survived the battle of the little big horn in UNK STOP 
START from the enlisted men he UNK to the UNK officer whose wife he tried to UNK a lot of men had plenty of reason UNK to dislike UNK UNK STOP 
START many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him STOP 
START but when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of UNK made against him the men who had seen UNK leave the UNK and the officer who had heard UNK suggest that the wounded be left to be UNK by the UNK refused to say a harsh word against him STOP 
START he was a member of the fighting seventh STOP 
START although it was at the battle of the little horn about which more words have been written than any other battle in american history that the 7th cavalry first made its mark in history the regiment was ten years old by then STOP 
START UNK major general george UNK UNK was the UNK first permanent commander and like such UNK as george s. UNK and UNK de la UNK allen in their rise to military UNK UNK was a UNK in blood and UNK warfare STOP 
START during the civil war UNK who achieved a brilliant record was made UNK general at the age of 23 STOP 
START he finished the war as a major general commanding a full division and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the u.s. army STOP

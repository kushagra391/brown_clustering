START the person who left the UNK there has never been identified STOP 
START it was a busy street UNK near the shopping center and UNK horses and wagons were often left at the UNK STOP 
START there are of course many UNK in any case against UNK STOP 
START she didn't like her UNK but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a UNK rage STOP 
START she had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed STOP 
START she would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her UNK STOP 
START if she avoided the train and hired a UNK the UNK might have recognized her STOP 
START if police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated she would be completely eliminated as a suspect STOP 
START uncle john UNK morse was the immediate popular suspect STOP 
START his sudden UNK appearance at the borden home was strange in that he did not carry an UNK of UNK with him although he clearly intended to stay overnight if not longer STOP 
START lizzie stated during the UNK that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door even though it was a very hot day STOP 
START it is evident that lizzie did not tell everything she UNK between her father and her uncle morse STOP 
START at that time UNK had a young law associate named arthur s. phillips STOP 
START a few years ago not too long before his death phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected morse of the murders STOP 
START he said morse and borden had UNK violently in the house that day information which must have come from lizzie STOP 
START it was obviously the sound of this argument that caused lizzie to close her door STOP 
START the new UNK UNK has reported UNK as saying long after the trial that if he only knew what borden said during his conversation with morse he would have convicted somebody STOP 
START notice UNK did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden STOP 
START he said he would have convicted somebody STOP 
START it is known that morse did associate with a group of UNK horse traders who made their headquarters at UNK a town not far from fall river STOP 
START they were a UNK lot and considered to be UNK and UNK characters STOP 
START fall river police did go to UNK to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an UNK whom he might have hired from among these men STOP 
START these officers found no UNK information STOP 
START UNK UNK was not as solid as it seemed STOP 
START he said he returned from the visit to his UNK on the UNK streetcar STOP 
START the woman in the house where the UNK was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner STOP 
START fall river is not a fashionable town STOP 
START the dinner hour there was twelve noon STOP 
START if this woman had delayed until after UNK to start her shopping she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days STOP 
START it is possible that morse told the woman it was UNK but it could have been earlier since she did serve dinner on time STOP 
START police did make an attempt to check on UNK UNK STOP 
START they interviewed the conductor of the streetcar morse said he had taken but the man did not remember morse as a passenger STOP 
START questioned further morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him STOP 
START the conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily catholic fall river there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made so UNK statement really proved nothing STOP 
START we do know that morse left the house before nine o'clock STOP 
START bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door STOP 
START morse said borden let him out and locked the screen door STOP 
START from that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked UNK to where his UNK was staying more than a mile away STOP 
START he met nobody he knew on this walk STOP 
START there is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when mrs. borden was killed STOP 
START morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room mrs. borden told the servant bridget i want you to wash these windows today STOP 
START UNK testimony was in direct contradiction STOP 
START she said it was after she returned from her UNK spell in the back yard that mrs. borden told her to wash the windows STOP 
START this was long after morse had left the house STOP 
START UNK knowledge of what mrs. borden told bridget could indicate that he had returned UNK to the house and was hidden there STOP 
START he knew the house fairly well he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone STOP 
START and despite UNK attempts to show that the house was locked up UNK than a drum this was not true STOP 
START the screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while bridget was sick in the back STOP 
START it was unlocked all the time she was washing windows STOP 
START morse could have returned openly while bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied STOP 
START mrs. borden would not have been UNK if she saw morse with an UNK or UNK in his hand STOP 
START he had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the UNK or UNK at the farm STOP 
START mrs. borden would have had no reason to UNK him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out STOP 
START he could have left for UNK street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar STOP 
START if he took an earlier streetcar than the UNK on his return he could have arrived at the borden house shortly after mr. borden came home STOP 
START with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlocked and bridget upstairs in her attic room he would have had free and easy access to the house STOP 
START with the second murder over he could have left hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned UNK in the neighborhood STOP 
START his UNK UNK down the side of the house to a UNK tree with crowds already gathering in front of the building and UNK UNK the side door was odd STOP 
START there was no close examination of his clothes for UNK and certainly no scientific test was made of them STOP 
START and for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing a few more UNK on his dark suit may very well have gone UNK STOP 
START the motive may have been the mysterious quarrel was no financial gain for morse in the murders STOP 
START on the other side of the UNK is the fact that he did see his UNK and the woman with whom she was staying STOP 
START the time would have been shortly after the murder of mrs. borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior STOP 
START he said he had promised mrs. borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the borden house STOP 
START what did pearson say about bridget UNK as a possible suspect in his UNK essay wrote the police soon ceased to look upon either bridget or mr. morse as in possession of guilty knowledge STOP 
START neither had any interest in the UNK it was probably to mr. UNK advantage to have mr. and mrs. borden alive STOP 
START both he and bridget were UNK by lizzie herself STOP 
START that was his complete discussion of bridget UNK as a possible suspect STOP 
START although pearson UNK almost everything lizzie said and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did he happily accepted her statement about bridget as the whole truth STOP 
START he felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl STOP 
START the UNK pearson speaks of is not an UNK but UNK expression of her opinion as reported in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet STOP 
START this officer had asked lizzie if she suspected her uncle morse and she replied she didn't think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them STOP 
START fleet asked the same question about bridget and lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her STOP 
START lizzie actually never named any suspect STOP 
START she told police about the prospective UNK she had heard UNK with her father some weeks before the murders but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner STOP 
START and much as she UNK UNK UNK she also did not UNK him STOP 
START at the UNK she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward or who had bad feelings toward her father STOP 
START she replied i know of one man that has not been friendly with him STOP 
START they have not been friendly for years STOP 
START asked who this was she named UNK STOP 
START her statement certainly was true press reported the same facts in using UNK interview but lizzie did not suggest at the UNK that UNK was the killer STOP 
START when i interviewed UNK who as a boy picked up UNK in the borden yard i asked if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders STOP 
START he said he had not heard of anybody else STOP 
START how about bridget UNK inquired STOP 
START oh she was just the maid there he replied waving a hand to indicate how completely UNK she was STOP 
START UNK was of course reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders STOP 
START everyone somehow UNK to UNK completely the fact that as far as we know there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders lizzie borden and bridget UNK STOP 
START all the officials on the case seem to have been UNK with a similar UNK as far as bridget was concerned although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have UNK their employers STOP 
START true it is no longer UNK for the UNK to be the killer in mystery fiction but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations STOP 
START the actions of bridget should be examined since she was there and opportunity did exist if only to establish her innocence STOP 
START there are also other factors that require closer examination STOP 
START the legend as it exists in fall river today always includes the solemn assurance that bridget returned to ireland after the trial with a big bundle of cash which lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut STOP 
START the people who believe and UNK the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points always to the UNK of lizzie STOP 
START if bridget did get any UNK of cash the last person who would have UNK her for services rendered would have been lizzie borden STOP 
START bridget was born in ireland one of fourteen children STOP 
START she was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time STOP 
START she worked as a domestic first in newport for a year and then in south UNK pennsylvania for another year STOP 
START she finally settled in fall river and after being employed for a time by a mrs. UNK was hired by the UNK STOP 
START i have previously described how during the week of the murder bridget spent the first few hot days UNK and UNK clothes STOP

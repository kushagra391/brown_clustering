START today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases but his primary function remains what it has always been to assist those who have money in their UNK struggle with those who have not STOP 
START it is from this UNK background that the fictional private detective was UNK STOP 
START the mythological private eye UNK from his UNK in real life in two essential ways STOP 
START on the one hand he does not work for a large agency but is almost always UNK STOP 
START as a UNK UNK the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client STOP 
START for this reason he appears as an independent and UNK figure whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine STOP 
START on the other hand the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases client would ever think of asking him to do such things STOP 
START whatever his original assignment the fictional private eye ends up by UNK and UNK a crime usually a murder STOP 
START operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves STOP 
START he UNK UNK not merely because he is paid to do so frequently he does not receive a fee at all but because he UNK his work because he firmly believes that murder must be UNK STOP 
START thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple UNK STOP 
START he is first and foremost a UNK of public UNK a servant of society STOP 
START it is this curious UNK of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective STOP 
START by virtue of his UNK his individualism and his freedom from external restraint the private eye is a perfect UNK of the middle class conception of liberty which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the UNK STOP 
START at the same time because the personal code of the detective UNK with the legal UNK of his society because he likes to catch UNK he is in middle class eyes a UNK man STOP 
START in this way the private detective gets the best of two possible UNK STOP 
START he is an UNK but not an UNK is a public servant but not a cop STOP 
START in short the fictional private eye is a specialized version of adam UNK ideal UNK the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare STOP 
START in the mystery story as in the wealth of nations individualism and the social good are two sides of the same UNK UNK STOP 
START there is only one catch to this UNK arrangement adam smith was wrong STOP 
START not only did the ideal UNK not produce the greatest good for the greatest number he ended by destroying himself by giving birth to monopoly capitalism STOP 
START the rise of the giant corporations in western europe and the united states dates from the period UNK STOP 
START now although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as UNK dickens and UNK it was not until the closing decades of the UNK century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction STOP 
START UNK holmes the UNK of all private eyes was born during the UNK STOP 
START thus the transformation of adam UNK ideal UNK into a mythological detective UNK closely with the decline of the real UNK in economic life STOP 
START driven from the UNK by the course of history our hero UNK himself as a private detective STOP 
START the birth of the myth UNK for the death of the ideal STOP 
START even on the fictional level however the UNK which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved STOP 
START the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct he UNK the law without being told to do so STOP 
START the private eye is therefore a moral man his morality rests upon that of his society STOP 
START the basic UNK of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad UNK with the distinction between legal and UNK STOP 
START unfortunately this assumption does not always hold good STOP 
START as capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma STOP 
START if he is good he may not be legal he is legal he may not be good STOP 
START it is the gradual UNK and UNK of this contradiction which creates the inner UNK of the evolution of the mystery story STOP 
START with the UNK of sir arthur UNK UNK UNK holmes the development of the modern private detective begins STOP 
START UNK holmes is not merely an UNK is very close to being a mental case STOP 
START a brief list of the great UNK little UNK would provide dr. UNK with ample food for thought STOP 
START holmes is UNK to the use of UNK and other UNK UNK is prone to UNK UNK induced by the playing of the UNK is a UNK an incredible UNK a confirmed UNK STOP 
START holmes rebels against the social UNK of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds STOP 
START his UNK begins as a defense against boredom STOP 
START it was in order to avoid the UNK routine of middle class life that holmes became a detective in the first place STOP 
START as he UNK watson my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the UNK of existence STOP 
START these little problems help me to do so STOP 
START holmes is a public servant to be sure the society which he serves UNK him to tears STOP 
START the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior STOP 
START although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with scotland yard holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and UNK of the police STOP 
START they for their part are convinced that holmes is too UNK and theoretical to make a good detective STOP 
START why do the police find holmes UNK the face of it it is because he UNK UNK techniques alien to official police routine STOP 
START another more interesting explanation is UNK at by watson when he UNK on several occasions that holmes would have made a magnificent criminal STOP 
START the great detective UNK agrees STOP 
START UNK insight is UNK by the mysterious link between holmes and his UNK dr. UNK STOP 
START the two men UNK each other closely in their UNK their UNK their UNK STOP 
START the first series of UNK holmes adventures ends with holmes and UNK UNK together on the edge of a cliff STOP 
START they are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace STOP 
START linked to holmes even in death UNK represents the UNK of the great detective the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant STOP 
START just as holmes the eccentric stands behind holmes the detective so holmes the potential criminal UNK behind both STOP 
START in the modern english UNK this UNK of UNK UNK in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared STOP 
START UNK UNK and lord peter UNK the respective UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK have retained UNK UNK but not his UNK for life and eccentric habits STOP 
START UNK and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people is true that they are also extremely dull STOP 
START their dedication to the status quo has been UNK at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a UNK holmes STOP 
START the UNK real UNK were unable to take root in england fled from the UNK parlor and made their way across the UNK atlantic STOP 
START in the american UNK detective story of the UNK and UNK the spirit of the mad genius from baker street lives on STOP 
START like holmes the american private eye rejects the social UNK of his time STOP 
START but unlike holmes he feels his society to be not merely dull but also UNK STOP 
START surrounded by crime and violence everywhere the UNK private eye can retain his purity only through a life of UNK isolation STOP 
START his alienation is far more acute than UNK is not an eccentric but rather an UNK STOP 
START with UNK UNK UNK UNK alienation is represented on a purely physical plane STOP 
START UNK UNK to ever leave his own house and UNK most of his time drinking beer and playing with UNK STOP 
START more profound and more disturbing however is the moral isolation of raymond UNK philip UNK STOP 
START in a society where everything is for sale UNK is the only man who cannot be bought STOP 
START his tough UNK UNK him to a solitary and difficult existence STOP 
START beaten UNK and exhausted he UNK the UNK killer through the UNK of high society and low UNK always alone always UNK STOP 
START in the end he gets his man but no one seems to care is its own and only reward STOP 
START a similar tone of underlying UNK and despair UNK the UNK UNK of UNK UNK and UNK the most famous of all american mystery stories UNK UNK the UNK UNK STOP 
START sam UNK UNK forces with a band of UNK in search of a UNK UNK statue of a UNK when the bird is found at last it turns out to be a UNK STOP 
START now the detective must save his own skin by UNK on the girl he loves who is also the real murderer STOP 
START for sam UNK neither crime nor virtue pays it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two STOP 
START because the private eye UNK to save society in spite of himself he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police STOP 
START the latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too UNK to care STOP 
START in either case they do not appreciate the private UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK mason and hamilton UNK UNK UNK and inspector UNK spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal STOP 
START frequently enough the police are themselves in league with the killer UNK red harvest provides a classic example of this theme STOP 
START but even when the police are honest they do not trust the private eye STOP 
START he is like UNK UNK too UNK to be reliable STOP 
START finally in the UNK UNK among others the UNK between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion sam UNK becomes the chief murder suspect STOP 
START in order to UNK himself he is compelled to find the real criminal who happens to be his girl friend STOP 
START what was only a vague suspicion in the case of UNK holmes now appears as a direct UNK the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite STOP 
START it is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma STOP 
START by UNK his own personal code of behavior the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is UNK with crime and corruption STOP 
START that society UNK by UNK the private eye as a threat to the status quo a potential criminal STOP 
START if the detective UNK upon UNK his personal standards he must now do so in conscious UNK of his society STOP 
START he must in short cease to be a detective and become a rebel STOP 
START on the other hand if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism STOP 
START UNK UNK resolved this contradiction by UNK to write mystery stories and turning to other UNK STOP 
START his UNK have adopted the opposite alternative STOP 
START in order to save the mystery story they have converted the private detective into an organization man STOP 
START the first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by mickey UNK mike UNK STOP 
START at first glance this hero seems to be more rather than less of an UNK than any of his UNK STOP 
START for UNK nothing is forbidden STOP 
START he UNK when he UNK takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge jury and UNK rolled into one STOP

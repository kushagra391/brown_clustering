START there are more stems per item in athabascan which UNK the fact that the athabascan languages have UNK somewhat more change in UNK from UNK than the UNK languages from UNK STOP 
START this may be because the athabascan UNK began earlier again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory including three wholly separated areas both STOP 
START the UNK however is not very much greater as shown by the fact that athabascan shows UNK stems per meaning UNK as against UNK for UNK with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample 24 as against 21 STOP 
START on deduction of UNK from UNK the stem item rate becomes UNK against UNK in equivalent number of languages STOP 
START these general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison STOP 
START the greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used STOP 
START these differences in turn result from the fact that my UNK UNK were built up of terms selected mainly to insure UNK of english meaning between UNK UNK and myself within a compact and uniform territorial area but that UNK vocabulary is based on UNK second UNK list which aims at eliminating all items which might be UNK or UNK determined STOP 
START UNK in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal one that was specifically adapted to the san UNK valley STOP 
START the result is that i included 70 animal names but UNK only 4 somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4 STOP 
START UNK and therefore UNK felt compelled to UNK all terms UNK species or even UNK UNK UNK UNK yellow pine UNK classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to UNK or UNK parts fish bird tree grass horn tail bark root STOP 
START the groups are therefore really UNK in content as well as in size STOP 
START other classes are included only by myself UNK UNK or only by UNK and UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes 1 body parts and products which with a UNK nearly even representation UNK terms out of UNK 25 out of 100 come out with nearly even ratios and UNK 2 nature 29 terms against 17 ratios UNK UNK UNK 3 UNK 16 15 terms ratios UNK UNK UNK 4 UNK 9 22 terms ratios UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of UNK as against UNK or 4 5 except for UNK where alone the athabascan ratio is lower STOP 
START this exception may be connected with UNK use of a much higher percentage of UNK UNK of his total list as against UNK in mine STOP 
START or the exception may be due to a particular UNK peculiar to the athabascan UNK STOP 
START more word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START -hlif word classes differ in their resistance or UNK to stem replacement within meaning UNK it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK athabascan and my UNK share UNK identical meanings with allowance for several UNK like UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START for UNK i UNK these UNK items in five columns according as they were expressed by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems STOP 
START the UNK for these five categories are not too UNK namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively STOP 
START for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two of five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems three others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively af af stems STOP 
START while the particular limits of these UNK may seem UNK arbitrary they do fairly express a corresponding UNK of more variable material and they UNK also in five classes along a similar scale containing approximately equal numbers of cases namely 19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan STOP 
START when now we count the frequency of the UNK items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or two or three or four we find these differences af STOP 
START this distribution can be UNK by UNK the distance in grades apart af divided by af gives a mean of UNK grades apart STOP 
START if the distribution of the UNK items were wholly UNK in the two families the distance would of course be 0 STOP 
START if it were wholly random and UNK it would be UNK assuming the five classes were equal in n which approximately they are STOP 
START the actual mean of UNK being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and UNK of no correlation it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of UNK in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as UNK long-term stem displacement STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START -hlin 1960 david d. thomas published basic vocabulary in some UNK languages al 2 no. 3 UNK 7 11 which UNK 8 UNK languages with the UNK language data on which UNK based the revised retention rate af in place of original af and his revised 100 word basic UNK list in towards greater accuracy UNK 21 UNK STOP 
START UNK findings are first that the individual items vary greatly and UNK in their UNK second that the UNK groups are surprisingly UNK in their average UNK as between UNK and UNK STOP 
START his first conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas mine on UNK and UNK was partially positive STOP 
START his second conclusion on UNK word classes agrees with mine STOP 
START this second conclusion independently arrived at by independent study of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are cannot be ignored STOP 
START thomas also presents a simple equation for UNK an index of UNK which weights not only the number of stems roots per meaning but their relative frequency STOP 
START thus his UNK values for some stem frequencies per meaning are stem identical in 8 languages UNK frequencies 7 and 1 UNK frequencies 4 and 4 UNK frequencies 4 3 and 1 UNK STOP 
START his formula will have to be weighed may be altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of material STOP 
START but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with UNK and UNK UNK UNK presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area STOP 
START as to relative frequencies of competing roots 7 1 vs. 4 4 etc. thomas with his UNK seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have STOP 
START the problem needs further exploration STOP 
START i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full UNK presentation that UNK publication in which in UNK UNK meanings i set off by UNK those forms in which n of stem b was af of stem a the UNK ones standing for af under four stems i set off by UNK cases where the combined n of stems af was af STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START UNK findings and others which will in time be developed will affect the method of UNK inquiry STOP 
START if UNK meanings show relatively low UNK of stems as i am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these UNK forms but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly UNK substituted for his 15 UNK UNK 15 good animal and plant items his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of athabascan language separation smaller STOP 
START and UNK of the outcome in centuries UNK since UNK UNK obviously carry more UNK and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with UNK UNK ones STOP 
START it is evident that UNK has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great UNK and feeling for the UNK behavior of UNK items STOP 
START why then this urge to include UNK items in his basic list is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible STOP 
START and why that insistence is the hope of UNK a list of items of universal occurrence STOP 
START but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a UNK STOP 
START not that such a list cannot be constructed the nearer it comes to UNK UNK the less significant will it be UNK STOP 
START its terms will tend to be UNK or vague and they will fit actual languages more and more badly STOP 
START the practical operational problem of UNK is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison STOP 
START the most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as UNK as possible STOP 
START in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely on their being UNK and distinctive STOP 
START an UNK or a fox or a UNK or a UNK or a UNK possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious UNK UNK identity as do an eye or tooth or UNK STOP 
START they UNK out easily naturally and UNK from the UNK of nature and existence they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities STOP 
START with the universal list as his weapon UNK has extended his march of UNK farther and farther into the past eight ten twelve UNK back STOP 
START and he has UNK greater or less UNK between all western hemisphere languages STOP 
START some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by UNK UNK or by diffusion and UNK STOP 
START but the farther out he moves the UNK will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger the UNK component in his UNK STOP 
START he has UNK provinces and UNK but he has not UNK them behind him nor does he control them STOP 
START he has announced results on UNK UNK UNK and almost all other american families and UNK and has UNK their degree of UNK he has not worked out by UNK one UNK complete classification of even a single family other than UNK STOP 
START that is his privilege STOP 
START the remote UNK possible has values of its own values of scope stimulus potential and imagination STOP 
START but there is also a firm aspect to UNK the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural UNK groups of languages as well as their more remote and UNK external UNK classification first with UNK age merely a UNK acquiring UNK knowledge of what happened in athabascan in UNK in UNK in the last few thousand years as well as UNK what more UNK may have happened between them STOP 
START this involves UNK progress and such will have to be the UNK work of UNK as a growing body of scientific inquiry STOP 
START if of the UNK of UNK UNK has escaped our steady UNK and UNK has UNK his own share in the founding that is no reason why we should UNK STOP 
START 8 STOP 
START -hlthere is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by UNK rules and procedure since his UNK and aims have grown so vast STOP 
START it seems time to consider a UNK of operational procedures for UNK studies on a more humble solid and limited basis STOP 
START i would propose first an UNK of attempts at a universal UNK list as UNK UNK and UNK inadequate in proportion as it is achieved STOP 
START i would propose next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible STOP 
START there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most UNK STOP 
START an attempted middle course might lead to devices like a UNK UNK dictionary from which every UNK word was selected STOP

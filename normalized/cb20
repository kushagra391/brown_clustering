START UNK unto death the nuclear war is already being fought except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets not yet STOP 
START it is being fought moreover in fairly close correspondence with the UNK of the UNK of the think factories STOP 
START they predicted UNK and UNK is what we are getting STOP 
START the biggest nuclear device the united states has UNK measured some 15 UNK although our UNK are said to be carrying two UNK bombs UNK STOP 
START some time ago however mr. khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made the soviet union would make them STOP 
START he seems to have at least a few UNK and UNK bombs on hand since we cannot assume that he has UNK his entire stock STOP 
START and now of course the UNK and cry for UNK is being raised on our side STOP 
START khrushchev UNK us with a UNK bomb be it then we must UNK on a crash program for UNK bombs of the common or hydrogen variety and UNK bombs which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing STOP 
START so UNK proceeds ad UNK or more accurately until the UNK begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective UNK grounds STOP 
START what is needed philip UNK writes in the UNK daily sun october 26 is a UNK STOP 
START the UNK must end sometime and probably quite soon STOP 
START only a UNK can end it professor UNK writes STOP 
START the UNK can either be that of war to destruction or that of diplomatic policy STOP 
START UNK points out that since our country is more UNK than the soviet union or red china it is the most vulnerable of the great powers europe of course must be written off out of hand STOP 
START he feels therefore that to seek a UNK in the arms policy of the united states is the least UNK path our government can take STOP 
START his proposal is opposed to that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past UNK UNK and UNK of the atomic energy commission dr. edward UNK and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the UNK of the cold war STOP 
START these gentlemen are calling for a UNK of testing in the atmosphere on the greatest possible scale all in the name of national security STOP 
START UNK is their first love and their last will be faithful unto death STOP 
START capable as their minds may be in some directions these UNK of the nation's security are incapable of learning or even of observing STOP 
START if this capacity had not failed them they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous UNK STOP 
START he has gained only one thing he has UNK a UNK bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to UNK it over the shorter UNK UNK STOP 
START but if his purpose was to UNK terror his action could hardly have UNK more obviously STOP 
START not terror but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the soviet sphere STOP 
START khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the UNK of UNK he has aroused yet our own nuclear UNK seem intent on following UNK in his UNK STOP 
START when one powerful nation UNK to UNK the success of another it is only natural STOP 
START thus when the russians sent up their first UNK american UNK was human enough and american determination to put american UNK into orbit was perfectly understandable STOP 
START but to UNK an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in UNK UNK STOP 
START the tide turns when east germans fled to the west by the thousands UNK of joy rose from the UNK of western UNK STOP 
START they are less vocal now when it is the west UNK who are UNK STOP 
START the flood is not as great only UNK a week according to one apparently conservative account but it is UNK STOP 
START west berlin morale is low and in age distribution the situation is UNK STOP 
START nearly 18 per cent of west UNK UNK residents are UNK or older only UNK per cent are under fifteen STOP 
START r. h. s. UNK UNK writing in the manchester UNK states that UNK from west berlin are now running at the rate not of UNK but of UNK a week and applications to leave have UNK to UNK a week STOP 
START the official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people STOP 
START whole families are moving and removal firms are UNK for months ahead STOP 
START the weekly loss is partly UNK by 500 UNK each week from west germany but the hard truth says UNK is that the closing off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german as distinct from russian troops was a major communist victory which dealt west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow STOP 
START the UNK UNK is dying on its feet STOP 
START another piece of evidence appears in a UNK from UNK in the observer london STOP 
START mark UNK writes people are leaving west berlin because they think it is dying STOP 
START they are leaving so fast that the president of the west german UNK federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the west to UNK for six UNK UNK work in factories in west berlin STOP 
START UNK UNK is amazing but if it has to hire its labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed STOP 
START the UNK is on the wall STOP 
START the only hope for west berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and UNK the city STOP 
START state department officials UNK to show their passes at the boundary and driving two blocks into east berlin under military UNK will not UNK STOP 
START tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful STOP 
START the materials for compromise are at hand the nation walter UNK and other sober UNK see UNK clark on p. UNK have UNK them out again and again STOP 
START a compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph but it will save berlin STOP 
START or the city can be a UNK monument to western UNK if that is what the west wants STOP 
START UNK the removal of UNK body from the UNK he shared with UNK to less distinguished quarters in the kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history STOP 
START it is in fact a relatively mild UNK of the dead STOP 
START a british writer richard UNK in a book dead men tell tales recalls that in the turmoil preceding the french revolution the body of henry 4 who had died nearly UNK years earlier was torn to pieces by a UNK STOP 
START and in england after the restoration the body of cromwell was UNK and UNK at UNK STOP 
START the head was then fixed on a pole at westminster and the rest of the body was buried under the UNK STOP 
START UNK these UNK UNK stalin should not lose all hope STOP 
START in UNK parliament erected a statue to cromwell in westminster facing UNK and there presumably he still stands STOP 
START UNK khrushchev however has created yet another problem for himself STOP 
START the UNK tomb is obviously adequate for double UNK moscow is a crowded city and the UNK of communism UNK waste STOP 
START who will take UNK place beside UNK is UNK UNK of course buried in london STOP 
START the UNK government might be willing to let him go but he has been dead UNK years and even the soviet UNK could not make him look UNK STOP 
START who then is of sufficient stature to lodge with UNK but UNK himself he has just shown who is top dog he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the soviet people STOP 
START besides he can hardly avoid UNK on the UNK of death which what with UNK and UNK seems to match that of life STOP 
START suppose he did lie beside UNK would it be permanent some future khrushchev decided to rake up the UNK of his UNK UNK would not the factory workers pass the same UNK UNK his UNK a man is laid to rest he is entitled to stay put STOP 
START if UNK buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand STOP 
START u UNK of burma the appointment of u UNK of burma as the UNK acting secretary general at this writing the choice appears to be certain offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends STOP 
START UNK slim of UNK and frederick UNK of ireland were early favorites in the running but france didn't like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter STOP 
START with the UNK maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed mr. hammarskjold u UNK emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be UNK by a UNK STOP 
START what is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his UNK STOP 
START in all the bitter UNK the UNK over election procedures the complicated numbers game that east and west played on the assistant UNK theme the gentleman from burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled UNK STOP 
START he has moreover another UNK which UNK well for the future STOP 
START he is a UNK which means that to him peace and the UNK of human life are not only religious UNK but a profound and UNK UNK STOP 
START u UNK of course will hold office until the spring of UNK when mr. UNK term would have come to an end STOP 
START whether the UNK on both sides that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen STOP 
START mr. khrushchev's demand for a UNK is UNK not dead west may or not remain satisfied with the kind of UNK that u UNK represents STOP 
START in a sense the UNK promised by mr. UNK sudden and tragic death has been avoided UNK have been set as yet the u.n. is still fluid vulnerable to the pressures that its new and UNK membership are bringing to bear upon it STOP 
START but at least the UNK who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the congo have been proved wrong STOP 
START to the hills girls STOP 
START no one who has studied the radical right can suppose that words are their sole UNK in trade STOP 
START these are UNK which UNK action and they are beginning to get it as UNK UNK and UNK report on page UNK STOP 
START even in areas where political UNK are deliberately left vague the spirit of UNK is spreading STOP 
START friends a picture magazine distributed by UNK dealers describes a UNK organization of employees of the gulf telephone company at UNK alabama STOP 
START if the day should ever come that foreign UNK UNK UNK along the gulf coast the account reads they can count on heavy opposition from a group of UNK telephone employees all girls STOP 
START heavily armed and UNK as a UNK civil defense outfit 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a UNK notice STOP 
START according to friends the unit was organized by john UNK a former world war 2 UNK who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company STOP 
START the girls very UNK in their uniforms are shown firing rockets from a UNK mounted on a UNK truck are also trained with UNK automatic weapons UNK rifles and other such UNK UNK STOP 
START this may be opera UNK now but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in UNK STOP 
START the country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means STOP 
START the doctrine has never worked is not working now STOP 
START the official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms cannot bring them into actual play STOP 
START a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined STOP 
START as the civic temper rises the more naive citizens begin to play soldier but the guns are real STOP 
START soon they will begin to UNK down the UNK they are assured are in our midst STOP

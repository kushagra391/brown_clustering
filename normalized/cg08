START tobacco road is dead STOP 
START UNK live tobacco road STOP 
START UNK yankee readers of UNK UNK are today informed by proud UNK that tobacco road is buried beneath a UNK UNK highway over which travel each day UNK businessmen more concerned with the UNK average than with the cotton crop STOP 
START thus we are compelled to face the UNK of the south an UNK which despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the southern culture has been utterly ignored by the bulk of southern writers STOP 
START indeed it seems that only in today's southern fiction does tobacco road with all the traditional UNK of UNK and UNK and UNK UNK continue to live but only as a weary UNK UNK STOP 
START those writers known UNK as the southern school have received UNK from even those critics least prone to UNK to many critics in fact the south has led the north in literature since the civil war both UNK and UNK STOP 
START such writers as william faulkner and robert UNK warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of UNK renaissance STOP 
START it is interesting however that despite this strong UNK in southern writing almost none of the writers has UNK the firmly UNK concept of the UNK UNK colonel UNK a UNK UNK as he silently UNK the revenue from the UNK cotton and tobacco crops the UNK negro servants UNK UNK as they plow the fields these and a host of other UNK UNK that deny the south its progressive UNK of the past century STOP 
START this is not to say that the south is no longer UNK a statement would be the UNK form of UNK STOP 
START but the south is and has been for the past century engaged in a UNK UNK which UNK enough is not reflected in its literature STOP 
START in 1900 the south was only UNK urban 1950 it had become UNK urban STOP 
START in a mere UNK the south has more than UNK its urban status STOP 
START there is a new south emerging a south losing the UNK traditions of an UNK society with the UNK of an UNK especially within recent decades STOP 
START as the new south UNK toward further UNK it becomes more and more UNK with the north a tendency which UNK UNK terms UNK as evidenced in such cities as charlotte birmingham and houston STOP 
START it is said that even at the present stage of southern UNK such a city as atlanta is not distinctly unlike columbus or UNK STOP 
START undoubtedly even the old southern UNK UNK has felt the new wind william UNK UNK in his latest novel an avenue named for UNK UNK a civil war general now UNK in typical california fashion UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the effects of television and other mass media are UNK regional UNK and UNK with a startling force STOP 
START as for progress the backward south can UNK of UNK UNK which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and UNK percent to UNK the second largest growth of the period for all cities over UNK STOP 
START the field then is ripe for new southerners to step to the UNK and write of this UNK phenomenon the southern UNK the new urban economy the UNK the pains of transition the labor problems list is obviously endless STOP 
START but these sources have not been UNK STOP 
START truman UNK is still UNK in southern UNK UNK the old southern UNK into something beautiful and UNK but as UNK as or even more UNK than yesterday STOP 
START william UNK while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy UNK UNK he is not to be classified as a southern writer and yet includes traditional southern concepts in everything he UNK STOP 
START even the great god faulkner the UNK one probable UNK for literary immortality has little concerned himself with these matters are simply not within his UNK province STOP 
START where are the writers to treat these changes the UNK tradition become such an UNK that the switch to UNK is somehow UNK or UNK present writers UNK UNK to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated UNK over the decades STOP 
START lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy these writers seem to be UNK themselves with an old one that is now as UNK as confederate money STOP 
START an example of the changes which have crept over the southern region may be seen in the southern UNK quest for a position in the UNK society a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since UNK STOP 
START today the negro must discover his role in an UNK south which indicates that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma hasn't changed radically but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context this new coat of paint STOP 
START the negro faces as much if not more difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an UNK one STOP 
START this represents a gradual change in an UNK social problem STOP 
START but there have been abrupt changes as well the UNK the UNK lines the bus strikes all of these were UNK even ten years ago STOP 
START today's evidence such as the fact that only three southern states south carolina alabama and mississippi still openly UNK integration would have UNK many of UNK southerners into UNK STOP 
START other examples of gradual changes that have affected the negro have been his moving up row by row in the UNK UNK and often getting higher wages better working conditions better schools changes that were slowly emerging even before the supreme court decision of 1954 STOP 
START then came this decision which UNK the process of gaining equality or perhaps UNK it historical evolution will determine which an abrupt change STOP 
START since 1954 the UNK desire for social justice has led to an UNK UNK rebellion STOP 
START he has frequently refused to move from white lunch UNK refused to UNK local laws which he considers UNK while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws STOP 
START this bold UNK after decades of humble UNK is indeed a UNK phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern way of existence STOP 
START a new order is UNK itself into being STOP 
START a new south is emerging after the UNK years of UNK uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in UNK his new role in the UNK defined UNK organizations of the white man STOP 
START the modern negro has not made a decisive debut into southern fiction STOP 
START it is clear that while most writers enjoy UNK the negro as a UNK humble old UNK who UNK UNK and UNK UNK with UNK UNK to his white employer or in old south terms UNK this stereotype is UNK to become in reality as UNK as UNK lester STOP 
START while there may still be many UNK UNK UNK scattered through the rural south such men appear to be a UNK breed STOP 
START writers openly admit that the negro is easier to write than the white man they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro type STOP 
START UNK an UNK negro character it would seem is one of the most difficult assignments a southern writer could UNK the success of such an UNK is as suggested above UNK rare STOP 
START just as the negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes UNK southern life it also points up the UNK of UNK in southern literature STOP 
START the book concerned with the UNK role in an urban society is rare indeed only keith UNK novel UNK lane has openly faced the problem STOP 
START all but the most UNK of confederate flag UNK admit that the old southern tradition is UNK in UNK and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the UNK of many UNK and UNK traditions of the UNK UNK UNK way of life STOP 
START many earlier writers UNK the UNK of the old order tended to UNK and UNK this UNK old south UNK creating such lasting impressions as UNK UNK UNK plantation STOP 
START modern writers who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the UNK of their subjects insist upon drawing out this legend UNK its burial when it well deserves a rest after the UNK of the past century STOP 
START perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this UNK they can hardly deny that exaggerated or not the old UNK is dead STOP 
START as john t. UNK says in his article UNK of southern UNK southwest review winter 1957 the UNK UNK where an old south already too UNK UNK in prose and poetry should be left to rest in peace forever dead and let us UNK hope forever done with STOP 
START UNK further UNK the southern UNK creation of an UNK image of their UNK which is too readily UNK by both foreign readers and visiting yankees our UNK is suspicious of all this UNK evidence of UNK presented to his senses STOP 
START it UNK and UNK him STOP 
START he is too deeply UNK in william faulkner and robert UNK warren STOP 
START the UNK of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry UNK before his eyes but his heart is away in UNK county with UNK UNK and night riders STOP 
START on this trip to the south he wants above all else to UNK the UNK of UNK UNK and to see at least one barn burn at midnight STOP 
START obviously such a northern UNK purpose is somewhat UNK to a child's experience with UNK he wants to see a world of UNK STOP 
START in the meantime while the south has been undergoing this UNK modernization that is so UNK to the curious yankee southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their UNK progress STOP 
START UNK UNK in his new book american writing in the twentieth century UNK quite UNK it seems certain subjects are UNK absent or have been only lightly touched STOP 
START no southern novelist has done for atlanta or birmingham what UNK UNK and UNK did for chicago or UNK UNK did for new york STOP 
START there are almost no fictional treatments of the UNK south STOP 
START not a single southern author major or minor has made the urban problems of an urban south his primary source material STOP 
START faulkner for one appears to be safe from the UNK fingers of all UNK in this regard STOP 
START faulkner UNK the southern legend perhaps more UNK than it has ever been or could ever be done STOP 
START he has made it his and his it remains UNK STOP 
START he treats it with a mythological universal application STOP 
START as his UNK UNK even though his emphasis is elsewhere faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the south quite UNK as can be proven by a quick UNK of his UNK and UNK families STOP 
START even two decades ago in go down UNK faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a UNK of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the south might be UNK and the curse of slavery UNK from its soil STOP 
START yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing UNK order in general and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact STOP 
START faulkner UNK in his vast and UNK UNK of UNK county the gradual changes which UNK into the south building layer upon layer of minute subtle UNK which eventually tend largely to hide the old way STOP 
START thus faulkner UNK us and UNK that the new south has gradually UNK out of the old south and consequently its UNK roots UNK STOP 
START yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself the problems with which a new south must UNK in UNK through a blind adolescence into the maturity of UNK STOP 
START with new UNK the modern farmer must perform the work of six men a machine stands between the UNK and his soil STOP 
START the thousands of city UNK who desert the farms yearly must UNK with even greater stress and tension the sacred wilderness is gradually UNK to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas STOP

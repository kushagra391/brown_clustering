START a variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group UNK STOP 
START these include UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and column UNK on UNK exchange UNK STOP 
START UNK of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators STOP

START in the present work whole sera have been UNK by UNK on UNK using single UNK similar to those described by sober and UNK and certain chemical and UNK properties of the fractions containing UNK of the UNK and UNK systems have been described STOP 
START materials and methods samples STOP 
START UNK samples were obtained from normal group a group b and group o UNK STOP 
START three of the UNK sera used were taken from recently UNK individuals STOP 
START one contained complete antibody and had a UNK of 1 UNK in saline STOP 
START the second contained incomplete antibody and showed UNK of 1 UNK in UNK and 1 UNK by the indirect UNK test STOP 
START the third containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete UNK had UNK of 1 UNK in saline 1 UNK in UNK and 1 UNK by the indirect UNK test STOP 
START in addition one serum was obtained from a UNK r. e. who had been UNK 6 years previously STOP 
START this serum UNK UNK of 1 16 in UNK and 1 UNK by the indirect UNK test STOP 
START these antibody UNK were determined by reaction with UNK af red cells STOP 
START UNK technique STOP 
START UNK and UNK activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group a group b or group o UNK by the following tube UNK methods STOP 
START one drop of each sample was added to one drop of a UNK suspension of group af or group b red cells in a small af test tube STOP 
START in several instances group o cells were also used as controls STOP 
START the red cells were used within 2 days after UNK and were washed with large amounts of saline before use STOP 
START the UNK of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 aj STOP 
START the tubes were then UNK at 1000 UNK for 1 UNK and examined UNK for UNK STOP 
START for the UNK method equal volumes of UNK UNK UNK sample and UNK cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 UNK and then were UNK at 1000 UNK for 1 aj STOP 
START all samples were tested by both the saline and UNK methods STOP 
START the activities of fractions of sera containing UNK UNK were tested by the saline UNK and indirect UNK techniques STOP 
START UNK and UNK af cells af and UNK and UNK af cells were used to test each sample in the interest of clarity and UNK only the results obtained with UNK af and UNK af cells will be presented here STOP 
START the saline and UNK tests were performed as described for the UNK samples except that the mixture was UNK for 1 UNK at UNK before UNK STOP 
START the saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect UNK test in the following manner STOP 
START the cells were washed three times with saline UNK serum was added the cells were UNK and the mixture was UNK at 1000 UNK for 1 UNK and examined for UNK STOP 
START the UNK sera used were prepared by UNK whole human serum into UNK STOP 
START those UNK shown by UNK to be of the broad spectrum type were selected for use in the present study STOP 
START the red cells for the UNK antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the af cells which had been UNK and stored at UNK for approximately 1 year STOP 
START these cells were UNK at UNK for 30 UNK and were UNK by UNK UNK and UNK with UNK UNK of UNK solutions 20 18 10 8 4 and UNK STOP 
START the cells were then washed three times with saline and UNK to UNK in saline STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK samples were allowed to UNK at room temperature for 3 UNK UNK and the serum was removed STOP 
START the serum was measured UNK and subsequently UNK in the cold for at least 24 UNK against three to four changes approximately UNK ml each of starting buffer STOP 
START this buffer UNK UNK was UNK m in af and UNK m in UNK UNK STOP 
START after dialysis the sample was UNK and the UNK placed on a af cm column of UNK UNK with starting buffer STOP 
START the UNK containing UNK UNK of n was prepared in our laboratory by the method of UNK and sober 7 from UNK UNK 100 UNK UNK STOP 
START the small amount of insoluble material which UNK during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ml of starting buffer UNK UNK in UNK ml of UNK saline and tested for antibody activity STOP 
START the UNK was done at UNK using gradient UNK essentially according to sober and UNK STOP 
START the deep UNK gradient employed fig. 2 was obtained with a UNK gradient UNK device UNK reference 8 and has been described elsewhere STOP 
START the other a shallow UNK gradient fig. 1 was produced with a so-called UNK apparatus the cone being a UNK UNK UNK and the sphere a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START each initially contained UNK ml of buffer the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer UNK m in both af and UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START a flow rate of UNK af was used and 12 ml fractions were collected STOP 
START approximately UNK fractions were obtained from each column STOP 
START these were read at UNK UNK in a UNK model du UNK and tested for antibody activity as described above STOP 
START paper UNK STOP 
START UNK protein identification fractions from the column were concentrated by UNK against a stream of air at UNK or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted UNK concentration of the protein and dialysis against UNK saline STOP 
START during the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at UNK by surrounding the apparatus with ice STOP 
START because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very UNK solutions and was a UNK procedure it was used in all but the earliest experiments STOP 
START paper UNK was carried out on the concentrated samples in a UNK model r cell using UNK buffer UNK UNK UNK strength UNK at room temperature on UNK UNK UNK paper STOP 
START five UNK were applied for 18 UNK after which the strips were stained with UNK blue and UNK was carried out using a UNK UNK STOP 
START when paper UNK was to be used for preparation eight strips of a whole serum sample or a UNK fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run under the conditions described above STOP 
START at the end of the run the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried stained for 1 UNK washed and dried while the other strips were maintained in a UNK position at UNK STOP 
START the UNK strips were then marked using the stained ones as a guide and cut UNK so as to separate the various protein bands STOP 
START the strip sections containing a given protein were UNK UNK with UNK ml of UNK saline and the UNK were tested for antibody activity STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK from the column which were to be subjected to UNK UNK were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and UNK for 16 UNK in the cold against at least 500 volumes of UNK saline UNK UNK UNK strength UNK STOP 
START they were then UNK at UNK UNK for 35 to 80 UNK at UNK in a UNK model e UNK at a protein concentration of UNK to UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK were computed as af values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the UNK patterns STOP 
START for UNK UNK fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less transferred to UNK tubes and UNK to 12 ml with UNK saline STOP 
START UNK was then carried out in a UNK model l UNK at UNK UNK for UNK to UNK UNK refrigeration being used throughout the run STOP 
START successive UNK fractions were then drawn off with a UNK UNK starting at the top of the tube and tested for UNK activity STOP 
START other methods will be described below STOP 
START experimental and results the insoluble material which UNK during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense UNK activity regardless of the blood group of the UNK STOP 
START with either of the UNK described UNK on UNK separated UNK of the UNK series into at least three regions figs. 1 and 2 one of extremely low UNK binding capacity one of low UNK binding capacity and one of high UNK binding capacity STOP 
START these have been UNK regions 1 2 and 4 respectively in fig. 1 STOP 
START when the early part of the gradient was UNK either by using the gradient shown in fig. 2 or by allowing the UNK gradient to become established more slowly region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas UNK p. j. and r. s. fig. 1 and e. m. fig. 2 STOP 
START the latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak region UNK between regions 1 and 2 STOP 
START in 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of UNK activity with intermediate UNK binding capacity was detected region 3 fig. 1 STOP 
START moreover after concentration using negative pressure dialysis UNK activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated UNK UNK p. j. d. a. and j. f. fig. 1 STOP 
START not all these regions UNK equal UNK activity as evidenced by UNK and the extent of the active areas STOP 
START in all cases most of the activity lay in the region of high UNK binding capacity STOP 
START this was particularly noticeable in group a and group b sera in which cases activity in regions 1 and 2 was usually not UNK without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all STOP 
START there appeared to be no difference in the distribution of UNK and UNK activity in group o serum though in two group o UNK j. f. and e. m. only one type of UNK was found in the regions of low UNK binding capacity figs. 1 and 2 STOP 
START several samples of UNK plasma were UNK in our laboratory by method 6 of UNK et al STOP 
START these fractions were tested for UNK UNK activity using fractions from group UNK plasma as a control STOP 
START as expected most of the activity was found in fraction af with slight activity seen in fraction UNK STOP 
START a sample of fraction af from group o plasma was dissolved in starting buffer UNK against this buffer and subjected to UNK using the gradient shown in fig. 2 STOP 
START once again both UNK and UNK activities were found in the insoluble material UNK during dialysis STOP 
START similarly both types of UNK were found in three regions of the UNK UNK having extremely low low and high UNK binding capacity respectively fig. 3 STOP 
START UNK of whole sera revealed that the areas of UNK antibody activity were generally continuous and wide STOP 
START the incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the UNK complete in the latter part STOP 
START the serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete UNK showed activity in both regions fig. 1 STOP 
START in all cases the activity against af cells was spread over a wider area than that with af cells regardless of the type of test saline UNK indirect UNK used for comparison STOP 
START the insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity STOP 
START in fact UNK of af cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing only incomplete antibody activity STOP 
START this was later known to be the result of UNK the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detected STOP

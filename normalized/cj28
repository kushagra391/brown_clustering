START thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief UNK experience STOP 
START it was predicted that UNK subjects would UNK to more liberal UNK reports of what the ambiguous figure looked like as reflecting their UNK about taking chances STOP 
START this was true mostly of those UNK subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action STOP 
START responses such as rope with a loop in it and two pieces of rope were quite characteristic STOP 
START UNK personality inventories STOP 
START -hlthe three personality inventories UNK were filled out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the UNK subjects STOP 
START these were the same subjects who were given the UNK test STOP 
START some UNK had been made concerning factors r n i and UNK on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were UNK as being of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity STOP 
START only UNK UNK between the two groups at less than the UNK level af STOP 
START one UNK had been made about the difference in security or UNK between those subjects who shifted their kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not STOP 
START the UNK had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably secure UNK and secure UNK being used as the groups for comparative personality studies STOP 
START it was predicted that those who shifted in their kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor i which the investigators refer to as the UNK factor STOP 
START all of the subjects in the UNK and kohnstamm-positive groups as defined for purposes of the personality studies were compared with those subjects who shifted in conditions 3 or 4 STOP 
START a t test on these two groups UNK vs. UNK gave a t value of UNK which is significant on the UNK test at the level STOP 
START discussion individual differences individual differences in kohnstamm reactivity to controlled kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study STOP 
START only UNK 11 subjects gave a positive kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concerning the phenomenon STOP 
START there were UNK 20 subjects who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the UNK of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration STOP 
START there were UNK 10 subjects who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were UNK as to the UNK of the kohnstamm-positive reaction STOP 
START among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred STOP 
START one subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax STOP 
START five subjects UNK did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm what that something was and also were given a demonstration STOP 
START four subjects UNK did not change even then but needed the additional information that an UNK under these circumstances was a perfectly normal UNK reaction which some people showed while others did not STOP 
START at no time was it implied by the UNK that the UNK initial reaction was UNK STOP 
START the subjects were only given information about other possibilities of normal reaction STOP 
START those who responded with an UNK in the naive state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in this fashion STOP 
START this information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show UNK must be UNK it STOP 
START these subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried STOP 
START the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition 1 the naive state is not adequately explained by such a concept as UNK if UNK is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal UNK STOP 
START in no way either UNK or UNK did the UNK indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of UNK to the voluntary contraction STOP 
START moreover when the UNK did UNK those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed the kohnstamm-positive subjects were UNK in their subsequent reactions to the kohnstamm situation STOP 
START they continued to give an UNK STOP 
START a differential UNK would have to be UNK to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the kohnstamm-positive UNK and yet UNK their naive kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion STOP 
START UNK the reaction of the subject in such a way as to UNK to his own expectations of the outcome i.e. that the UNK is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction because of his knowledge that to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons 1 the UNK apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose and 2 UNK of the phenomenon despite UNK of something else happening e.g. of becoming UNK and maybe falling an expectation UNK UNK by one of the subjects STOP 
START a suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of normal reactions different from those which they gave STOP 
START while they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had they were also informed that there were other UNK who reacted as they had STOP 
START there was no UNK made that their initial reaction absence of an UNK was less preferred than the presence of UNK STOP 
START a more UNK explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less UNK and to relax since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as normal STOP 
START the naive state condition 1 could therefore be viewed as an UNK one for UNK of the subjects in this study STOP 
START they were not free to be themselves in this situation an UNK one where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior STOP 
START instructions to relax i.e. to be spontaneous and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have was not sufficiently UNK until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given STOP 
START while other conditions might be even more effective in bringing about a change from UNK to UNK in kohnstamm reactivity it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common factor the capacity to UNK an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior STOP 
START alcohol UNK succeeded in changing UNK to UNK quite UNK in one pilot subject the only one with whom this technique was tried STOP 
START this subject who has been undergoing UNK UNK for five years did not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four UNK conditions used in this experiment while sober STOP 
START after two drinks containing alcohol her arm flew upward very freely STOP 
START there was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement STOP 
START she described herself as having the same kind of UNK feeling as she had once experienced under UNK STOP 
START she UNK her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily UNK from her the controls which she felt so UNK necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls STOP 
START many subjects attributed differences in kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control voluntary as the kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and UNK as the UNK subjects perceived it STOP 
START these suggested interpretations were given by the subjects UNK when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had STOP 
START the kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no control STOP 
START they explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors STOP 
START they felt that they too could UNK the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction STOP 
START some of those who did not initially react with an UNK also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors an inability to UNK control UNK STOP 
START one subject UNK asked after her arm had finally UNK do you suppose i was UNK keeping it down before said that her arm did not go up at first because i wouldn't let it thought it wasn't supposed to STOP 
START this subject was one who gave an UNK on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first STOP 
START she had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the first trial but had consciously prevented it from so doing STOP 
START she explained UNK of others by saying that they were not letting themselves relax STOP 
START when informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go up she commented i don't see how they can prevent it STOP 
START in contrast to this UNK explanation for UNK given by the kohnstamm-positive subjects the UNK subjects offered an UNK hypothesis to explain UNK STOP 
START they felt that they were UNK as much as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level STOP 
START the above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in UNK in the kohnstamm-positive subjects rather that they could be UNK sufficiently not to UNK with UNK STOP 
START one kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the naive condition described her subjective experience as follows you feel they're going up and you're on a stage and it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's what's supposed to happen STOP 
START she then described her experience as one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in which she UNK control STOP 
START however she was able to relax and yield to the moment STOP 
START it is our hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive subjects are less UNK about UNK control than are UNK subjects they can give up their control and allow themselves to be UNK rather than actors STOP 
START it is our belief that this readiness to UNK some control was evidenced by the kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below STOP 
START thus this readiness to relax controls evidenced in the kohnstamm situation appears to be a more general personality factor STOP 
START UNK illusion the kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be UNK to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world STOP 
START there was a significantly greater number in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis ball resting on it remained UNK on the UNK STOP 
START this occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going UNK STOP 
START they knew that their UNK experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting on the UNK UNK STOP 
START yet they were not so bound by past experience and UNK as to deny their immediate UNK and to be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be STOP 
START the change in UNK by some of the UNK subjects after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions suggests that their UNK and UNK is associated with their general mode of UNK to strange or unknown situations STOP 
START they were able to experience at first in terms of past UNK STOP 
START when informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions they were then able to experience the UNK of the present STOP 
START it might be UNK that these subjects are UNK afraid of being wrong they perceive new internal and UNK situations as threatening until they are tested and proved otherwise STOP 
START while the interpretations that have been given are UNK only they gain support from such comments as the following which was made by one of the UNK subjects who did not on the first trial perceive the UNK illusion STOP

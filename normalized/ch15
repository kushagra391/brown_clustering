START at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall STOP 
START the outside UNK space is filled by UNK blocks on edge STOP 
START the wooden UNK between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall STOP 
START mortar is poured between this UNK and the UNK blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation UNK STOP 
START for details see UNK fig. 5 STOP 
START the first one or two roof boards marked e in fig. 6 are slipped into place across the roof beams from outside the shelter STOP 
START these boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams from inside the shelter STOP 
START concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards STOP 
START the roof blocks are in two UNK and are not UNK together STOP 
START work on the roof continues in this way STOP 
START the last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter STOP 
START when the roof blocks are all in place the final rows of wall blocks are UNK into position STOP 
START the structure is complete STOP 
START see fig. 7 STOP 
START building plans are on page 21 STOP 
START solid concrete blocks relatively heavy and UNK are used for this shelter STOP 
START these blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit STOP 
START solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection STOP 
START UNK are an alternative STOP 
START if they are used the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the UNK solid concrete blocks STOP 
START the illustrations in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall STOP 
START more detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and UNK STOP 
START other sources of information include the national concrete UNK association 38 south UNK street chicago ill. the portland cement association UNK west grand avenue chicago ill. and the structural clay products association washington d.c. STOP 
START UNK UNK shelter an outdoor UNK fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks STOP 
START see fig. 9 UNK shelter STOP 
START most people would have to hire a UNK to build this shelter STOP 
START plans are on pages 22 and 23 STOP 
START this shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface making it UNK to build an underground shelter STOP 
START two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart STOP 
START the space between them is filled with UNK UNK or earth STOP 
START the walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built STOP 
START the roof shown here fig. 9 is a UNK UNK of UNK concrete covered with at least 20 inches of UNK UNK STOP 
START an alternate roof perhaps more within UNK reach could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams UNK with boards and UNK STOP 
START it would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of UNK UNK STOP 
START the materials for a UNK shelter would cost about UNK STOP 
START UNK charges would be additional STOP 
START the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection STOP 
START UNK metal shelter UNK UNK metal sections or UNK concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground STOP 
START these are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface STOP 
START they form effective fallout shelters when UNK over with earth as shown in figure 10 STOP 
START materials for this shelter would cost about UNK STOP 
START a UNK probably would be required to help build it STOP 
START his charges would be added to the cost of materials STOP 
START this shelter as shown on page 24 would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation STOP 
START an alternate UNK entrance shown on page 25 would reduce the cost of materials UNK to $100 STOP 
START the national lumber manufacturers association washington d. c. is developing plans to UNK UNK treated lumber for underground shelter construction STOP 
START the structural clay products institute washington d.c. is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction STOP 
START underground concrete shelter an underground UNK concrete shelter can be built by a UNK for about $1,000 to UNK depending on the type of entrance STOP 
START the shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection STOP 
START the illustration fig. 11 shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and UNK over STOP 
START the same shelter could be built into an UNK or below ground level STOP 
START plans for the shelter with either a UNK or UNK entrance are shown on pages 26 and 27 STOP 
START another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction STOP 
START it would add about $500 to the total cost of the home STOP 
START the shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the washington d.c. area in the spring of 1959 STOP 
START important considerations common to each type of shelter are 1 STOP 
START UNK of the entrance STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK reception STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START -hlthe entrance must have at least one UNK turn STOP 
START radiation UNK somewhat like light STOP 
START some will go around a corner STOP 
START the rest continues in a straight line STOP 
START therefore sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter STOP 
START UNK is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by UNK in the wall and by the open entrance STOP 
START a UNK may be installed to increase comfort STOP 
START a UNK is essential for the UNK shelter and for the underground shelters STOP 
START it should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person STOP 
START UNK UNK also are necessary as shown in figs. 9 10 and 11 but UNK are not STOP 
START radio reception is cut down by the UNK necessary to keep out radiation STOP 
START as soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made STOP 
START it probably will be necessary to UNK an outside antenna particularly to receive UNK UNK STOP 
START lighting is an important consideration STOP 
START continuous UNK lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a UNK UNK battery to which is wired a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START tests have shown that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days STOP 
START with a spare battery a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured STOP 
START a UNK or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a UNK light is needed STOP 
START there should be a regular electrical UNK in the shelter as power may continue in many areas STOP 
START other considerations STOP 
START if there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be UNK as shown in the UNK page 29 STOP 
START other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency UNK STOP 
START basement walls that project above the ground should be UNK as shown in the UNK page 29 STOP 
START in these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide STOP 
START bunks or materials to build them may have to be put inside the UNK before the shelter walls are completed STOP 
START the basement or UNK shelters also will serve for UNK or UNK protection STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK in a shelter the UNK of fallout UNK rapidly at first STOP 
START UNK hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion STOP 
START but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous STOP 
START therefore civil defense instructions received over UNK or by other means should be followed STOP 
START a UNK radio is essential STOP 
START radiation instruments suitable for home use are available and would be of value in UNK that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation STOP 
START there is a possibility that UNK UNK with UNK radiation meters may become available STOP 
START one instrument thus would serve both purposes STOP 
START your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from state and federal sources STOP 
START it will tell you as soon as possible how long to stay in your shelter soon you may go UNK long you may stay outside STOP 
START you should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer STOP 
START a UNK in the UNK page 30 tells what is needed STOP 
START families with children will have particular problems STOP 
START they should provide for simple recreation STOP 
START there should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be UNK STOP 
START part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake STOP 
START to break the UNK it may be necessary to UNK tasks that will keep the family busy STOP 
START records such as UNK can be kept STOP 
START the survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio STOP 
START a record should be kept of the information and instructions including the time and date of broadcast STOP 
START family UNK probably will be necessary STOP 
START UNK should be operated UNK on a regular schedule STOP 
START there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has UNK enough to allow use of the whole basement STOP 
START however as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum STOP 
START the UNK problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied STOP 
START food medical supplies UNK and equipment if not already stored in the shelter must be quickly gathered up and carried into it STOP 
START after the family has settled in the shelter the UNK rules should be UNK out by the adult in charge STOP 
START sanitation in the UNK of the family shelter will require much thought and planning STOP 
START provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human UNK will be an UNK problem STOP 
START a covered UNK such as a kitchen UNK UNK might do as a toilet STOP 
START a UNK UNK can with a tightly fitting cover could be used to keep the UNK until it is safe to leave the shelter STOP 
START water UNK will be difficult and should be planned carefully STOP 
START a portable electric heater is UNK for shelters in cold UNK STOP 
START it would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning STOP 
START even if the electric power fails after an attack any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable STOP 
START body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature STOP 
START warm clothing and UNK of course are essential STOP 
START UNK heating or cooking should be avoided STOP 
START a flame would use up air STOP 
START some families already have held weekend UNK in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START -hlif an attack finds you without a prepared shelter few areas if any are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about STOP 
START a family dwelling without a basement provides some natural UNK from fallout radiation STOP 
START on the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside STOP 
START the best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house STOP 
START a UNK basement can cut the fallout radiation to UNK of the outside level STOP 
START the UNK place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground STOP 
START if there is time after the warning the basement UNK could be improved substantially by UNK windows with UNK dirt books magazines or other heavy material STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START UNK in apartment buildings large apartment buildings of UNK or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family UNK STOP 
START in general such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space STOP 
START the central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building with concrete floors should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling STOP 
START the basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the UNK constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling STOP 
START the federal government is UNK local governments in several places to survey residential commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide and for how many people STOP 
START the problem for the city apartment UNK is primarily to plan the use of existing space STOP 
START such planning will require the cooperation of other UNK and of the apartment management STOP

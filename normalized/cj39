START but briefly the UNK UNK must be examined for its UNK STOP 
START then the fact that the lower channel line was UNK had further UNK significance STOP 
START and then the application of the count rules to the width UNK of the UNK gives us an UNK estimate of the probable depth of the decline STOP 
START the very idea of there being count rules implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of UNK activity and the extent of the UNK run up or run down movement STOP 
START this expectation is what really sold point and figure STOP 
START but there is no positive and consistently UNK relationship in the UNK sense STOP 
START experience will show that only the UNK UNK apply and in fine these merely UNK upon a relationship between the UNK and UNK of events STOP 
START after all too much does not happen too suddenly nor does very little take long STOP 
START the advantages and UNK of these two types of UNK bar UNK and point and figure UNK remain the subject of fairly UNK litigation among their respective professional UNK with both methods enjoying in common one UNK merit STOP 
START they are both UNK methods STOP 
START even if we strip their respective claims to the UNK minimum the odds still favor them both for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse STOP 
START of course many more things are UNK besides prices STOP 
START the foregoing have been methods of UNK prices but now let us look at some of the other UNK that are UNK UNK and which are looked to for their UNK abilities STOP 
START the quest for methods the search for UNK UNK is UNK STOP 
START UNK have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price STOP 
START the theory behind this is of course UNK in character STOP 
START as the number of reported freight car UNK increased this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings UNK UNK UNK and UNK therefore increased stock market prices STOP 
START we now know that things rarely ever work out in such UNK fashion and that car UNK while perhaps interesting enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn STOP 
START but the quest for such an index goes on UNK with all manner of investors and UNK participating ranging from the UNK UNK type virtually to the UNK UNK operator all seeking UNK UNK daily and often UNK for the UNK index that will UNK the eternal secret which way will the market move up or down recalls to mind the quest of UNK times for the fountain of youth a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships STOP 
START just as heavily invested are the UNK of UNK of modern men who carry on the quest for the UNK index STOP 
START the quest offers careers STOP 
START much of this goes on in offices high up in wall UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START there sit men who make moving UNK of weekly volume monthly UNK of UNK ratios ratios of the number of advances to the number of UNK ratios of an individual UNK performance to overall market performance ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume odd-lot UNK and what not STOP 
START they are concerned with all things UNK in UNK bonds UNK coffee UNK cotton tin UNK etc. STOP 
START and along UNK west jackson boulevard la UNK street and around the UNK UNK UNK there sit men who chart crop reports who divide the number of reported UNK by the number of reported UNK and the number of UNK by the amount of corn STOP 
START they plot the open interest curves UNK curves and they even divide democratic UNK by republican UNK STOP 
START all these things and countless more enter into their UNK and yet the UNK index remains UNK STOP 
START not at any rate in the UNK sense of the word STOP 
START the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these UNK will doubtless never be written for the UNK index is about as UNK as the fountain of youth STOP 
START but whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit of the UNK index STOP 
START we mentioned odd-lot UNK a few paragraphs ago STOP 
START in the stock market the normal trading package is a hundred shares just as UNK UNK is the standard grain contract package STOP 
START a stock UNK for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot UNK on the floor of the exchange STOP 
START this results in a separate record being made UNK these UNK from the overall volume of trading STOP 
START according to the theory underlying odd-lot UNK the UNK who UNK odd lots is most likely a small UNK one who can't afford to trade round lots STOP 
START or to use the UNK UNK of one odd-lot index UNK they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated UNK of traders STOP 
START falling most easily UNK to an adverse market movement for this rank of traders can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot traders do UNK is taken to UNK the wrong thing to do STOP 
START figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers STOP 
START odd-lot index observers then make UNK of the data according to their particular statistical UNK STOP 
START they might for example plot it exactly as is or they might make ten day moving UNK of it or longer moving UNK or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales STOP 
START the particular UNK is a matter of individual taste STOP 
START the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart usually of a popular stock average STOP 
START towards the end of an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply STOP 
START this UNK the UNK that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top STOP 
START similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again UNK the UNK that a bottom is becoming a greater UNK STOP 
START thus in the UNK the odd-lot UNK is one who buys at the UNK and sells at the UNK UNK occasional individual exceptions STOP 
START while it had long been known in general that the public is always wrong the use of odd-lot UNK now puts the UNK on a statistical basis STOP 
START one might well wonder why the public is always wrong and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg STOP 
START which came first it really that the public buys at the UNK and not that the market UNK out when the public buys the UNK at UNK STOP 
START does the public usually sell at UNK or does the market usually bottom out when the public sells have been using the word public in UNK marks that is in its UNK UNK with reference to the odd-lot index theory STOP 
START obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy and vice UNK STOP 
START and while all concerned are members of the literal public somewhat less than all concerned although still a majority form the UNK marked public STOP 
START and the public UNK the public leaves the so-called sophisticated element the element on the other end of the UNK UNK STOP 
START this element is often called strong hands STOP 
START strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations are the primary UNK STOP 
START they UNK campaigns so to speak even if this UNK is UNK among them and their UNK action only UNK organized STOP 
START strong hands act hands react STOP 
START strong hands move first hands ask what is going on strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even in the face of UNK news reports STOP 
START they are able to sit more UNK with what they have bought STOP 
START needless to say strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands UNK on the way up at higher prices during the UNK phase of the campaign STOP 
START certain badly UNK market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about this UNK of competitive forces STOP 
START but after all can anyone imagine a market UNK the reverse of these things were true to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and the majority would make consistent profits STOP 
START how much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few the UNK concerning the sophisticated UNK and its UNK UNK is put to test during every campaign and UNK only upon results before STOP 
START it quite often happens that campaigns go UNK resulting in a most UNK UNK of strong hands into UNK hands just as a member of a former UNK public may emerge UNK right the next time STOP 
START membership in the UNK UNK too STOP 
START the study of odd-lot UNK is somehow UNK to the spectacle of a man trying to UNK his own shadow what with all observers trying to get on the side of the few at the same time STOP 
START the usefulness of this study and of UNK analysis as well UNK in direct proportion to the UNK of its use STOP 
START it has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word few STOP 
START UNK opposition must UNK as to the future course of prices if there is to UNK a market at all STOP 
START and the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact UNK STOP 
START there need be no UNK about UNK this STOP 
START anyone still UNK that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market UNK the majority consistently UNK what the minority loses STOP 
START mr. john UNK whose work has been discussed in this chapter was quoted in a new UNK magazine profile as saying of course you have to remember it's a good thing for us UNK that there aren't more of us STOP 
START if you got too many people UNK by this method their operations would begin to affect stock prices and thus throw the UNK off STOP 
START the method would become UNK STOP 
START mr. alexander h. UNK study helps in point and figure technique tells the readers we assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the UNK and commodities markets STOP 
START what with traders trading for so many different objectives and what with there being so many unique and UNK market theories and trading techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough fans to UNK itself STOP 
START nevertheless all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible UNK of expression if they lead to a market UNK at all STOP 
START in the final analysis then the UNK becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance UNK any amount of UNK and calculation however elaborate STOP 
START thus while his theory or technique may not be UNK it is commonplace for UNK and UNK positions to become temporarily UNK STOP 
START though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the possible conclusions remain but two STOP 
START chapter 6 more methods the UNK the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the UNK methods already in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather UNK empirical correlation that is to follow and to UNK the UNK that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead STOP

START the russian UNK beat the tar out of the american UNK in the 1960 UNK for one reason they were better STOP 
START they were better trained better looking better built better disciplined and something else they were better dancers STOP 
START our UNK are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance STOP 
START the russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics STOP 
START but why gymnastics at all is the sport really important all we did pretty well in some other areas of the UNK competition STOP 
START but if it is important what can we do to improve ourselves is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem for just as gymnastics can learn from dance dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics STOP 
START taking first things first let's understand the sport called gymnastics STOP 
START it is made up of UNK which might be said to start with a UNK run through such UNK as UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK in nearly impossible combinations of UNK UNK and UNK and apparatus work STOP 
START the apparatus used by UNK was once a common sight in american UNK but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games STOP 
START the parallel bars horse buck UNK UNK bar UNK and UNK formerly in the school UNK were replaced by baseball UNK UNK and football STOP 
START but the russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one endurance STOP 
START the UNK must develop strength flexibility coordination timing rhythm courage discipline UNK and the desire for perfection STOP 
START in short gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well STOP 
START the addition of endurance training later when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury provides that final quality that makes the top UNK soldier or citizen STOP 
START another reason UNK study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life STOP 
START an UNK teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days STOP 
START most UNK have been UNK UNK UNK for centuries STOP 
START in most sports as in most walks of life the angels are on the side of those who begin young and the russian UNK of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him STOP 
START the american is very lucky if he has three STOP 
START if a nation wished to get a head start in physical UNK over all other nations it would start its UNK students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that UNK american schools STOP 
START first of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension since action UNK both STOP 
START UNK enough it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty STOP 
START certainly there would be less anxiety fewer UNK it is the UNK child who UNK the worst injuries and higher UNK UNK since alert children work better STOP 
START russia knows this and that is why there were over UNK competing for places as candidates for the UNK UNK team STOP 
START eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself STOP 
START we could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over UNK million people STOP 
START and what has dancing to do with all this great deal STOP 
START russia's young UNK have studied dance before having the UNK training on apparatus STOP 
START UNK trained in posture and coordinated movement and UNK to rhythm they presented the audiences in rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any UNK contest STOP 
START american audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons STOP 
START they saw completely UNK and obviously UNK men performing with incredible grace STOP 
START they were further stripped of old UNK tales by seeing the slender lovely russian girls performing UNK requiring tremendous strength and with not one UNK muscle STOP 
START president kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation STOP 
START if we wait until children are in junior high or high school we will never manage it STOP 
START to be fit one has to start early with young children and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance STOP 
START if the dance teachers of america make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible we will be that much ahead STOP 
START school teachers all too UNK for the job they must do will need UNK STOP 
START there should be youngsters who know how to do a UNK and also how to help other children learn it STOP 
START they should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught STOP 
START dance teachers can respond to president kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work but also through the kind of basic UNK work that makes for strength and flexibility STOP 
START very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility STOP 
START dancers do have flexibility STOP 
START they often fail however to develop real UNK back chest shoulder and arm strength STOP 
START ask any group of UNK to do ten UNK or three UNK and the results considering the amount of physical training they have had will be very UNK STOP 
START even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas STOP 
START this isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the UNK boys in america cannot chin themselves once and that english school girls UNK them in almost every test even UNK and endurance STOP 
START the only area in which american boys hold their own is the baseball throw STOP 
START the UNK bar for arm and shoulder strength a UNK bar is recommended STOP 
START it should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone and a chair should be placed under it a little to one side STOP 
START those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one UNK each time they pass under it STOP 
START those who are too weak should climb on the chair and starting at the top of the chin let themselves slowly down STOP 
START when they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to UNK STOP 
START parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home STOP 
START the horse kick arm shoulder chest upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick STOP 
START start on hands and feet STOP 
START keeping the hands in the starting position run in place to a quick rhythm STOP 
START after this has become easy use UNK and UNK rhythms kicking higher and higher STOP 
START follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all UNK kicking as high as possible STOP 
START UNK UNK are essential but few have the strength for them at first STOP 
START start on the knees in a large circle STOP 
START fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor STOP 
START push back up and repeat STOP 
START do this exercise six times each class period STOP 
START as strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward STOP 
START start by falling forward to a point close to the feet and as strength improves fall farther and farther out STOP 
START try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate UNK from the hands STOP 
START the UNK itself can be taught by starting at the top of the UNK with legs spread wide STOP 
START let the body down slowly taking at least five seconds for the letting down STOP 
START five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK come after arms chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength STOP 
START of course those who have developed more will find them easier STOP 
START start with the class standing in a circle with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle STOP 
START at first each child should do a UNK by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone and those who need help STOP 
START drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back STOP 
START the left will follow at once STOP 
START the right will land first followed by the left STOP 
START return to the standing position STOP 
START care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible STOP 
START this will prevent flat falls and UNK injuries STOP 
START bare feet are better for such work than any form of UNK STOP 
START eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg STOP 
START the child should then bring both legs together overhead point the toes and UNK the seat muscles STOP 
START be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time STOP 
START UNK the UNK is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics and as with all UNK the sooner begun the better the results STOP 
START have the class lie UNK with knees apart and bent STOP 
START place flat UNK on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears fingers pointing toward the shoulders STOP 
START arch the back UNK to make a bridge STOP 
START be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling STOP 
START as flexibility improves the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher STOP 
START later this can be combined with the UNK to provide a UNK STOP 
START back circle to further increase back flexibility work on the back circle STOP 
START have the class lie prone STOP 
START place the hands in front of the chest STOP 
START keep the legs straight and the toes pointed STOP 
START UNK the arms slowly this UNK the back STOP 
START at the peak of the arch tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head STOP 
START improvement can be measured by the UNK distance between toes and head STOP 
START UNK the last essential to the UNK UNK program is the UNK or forward roll STOP 
START this used to be part of every child's bag of UNK but few children can do it today are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright STOP 
START for most small children learning a forward roll is simply a matter of UNK another child who can STOP 
START after it has been seen have the child start on a UNK on hands and knees a thin UNK UNK is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling STOP 
START he places the hands on either side of the head keeping the chin down on the chest STOP 
START he then UNK his seat into the air and the teacher UNK it over STOP 
START one or two practice runs should be sufficient for UNK STOP 
START if however the child is weak UNK or afraid more help will be needed STOP 
START when the child raises his seat into the air the teacher takes hold under both sides of the UNK no matter what happens the child's performance will be controlled STOP 
START by UNK the seat UNK a little the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded STOP 
START these are UNK but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting UNK that can be performed by a strong flexible body we are not talking of eccentric UNK STOP 
START even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal the good UNK will be a better dancer a better UNK and a human being with a greater UNK of safety in any activity STOP 
START it is very important for parents to understand that early training is UNK STOP 
START and dancing school so helpful in artistic and psychological development also UNK to this essential early training and can contribute even more STOP

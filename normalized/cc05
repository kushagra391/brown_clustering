START the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters STOP 
START here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking STOP 
START to both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest the same UNK UNK for what was unique in each the same UNK UNK and UNK intelligence the same UNK of judgment STOP 
START for this latest addition to the great letters series under the general UNK of louis UNK miss UNK has made a selection which UNK displays the variety of UNK genius not to mention the UNK of his style STOP 
START and how he could write famous criticism of brother UNK third style is surely as UNK even UNK UNK an analysis of the UNK UNK air UNK as henry himself could ever have produced STOP 
START his letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as UNK UNK and UNK understanding a piece of advice as ever a UNK UNK to a sensitive child and with just the right tone of UNK good humor STOP 
START most of all his letters to his UNK colleagues show a UNK as well as an UNK which help to explain UNK reference to james as that UNK genius STOP 
START miss UNK speaks of his superb gift for intellectual friendship and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic UNK or passionate UNK STOP 
START this is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication or even desire for communication between UNK schools of thought STOP 
START it holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual has become a term of UNK to millions of UNK people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues STOP 
START to his harvard UNK UNK UNK whose UNK position differed radically from his own james could write different as our minds are yours has UNK mine as no other social influence ever has and in UNK with you i have always felt that my life was being lived UNK STOP 
START of another UNK george UNK he could write the great event in my life recently has been the reading of UNK book STOP 
START although i absolutely UNK the UNK of it i have literally UNK with delight at the UNK perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page STOP 
START writing to his UNK george herbert palmer glorious old palmer as he addresses him james says that if only the students at harvard could really understand UNK UNK palmer and himself and see that their varying systems are so many religions ways of UNK life and worth fighting for then harvard would have a genuine UNK universe STOP 
START the best condition of it would be an open conflict and UNK of the diverse systems STOP 
START the world might ring with the struggle if we devoted ourselves exclusively to UNK each other STOP 
START the UNK is of course UNK yet james was not lacking in fundamental UNK unless we measure him by that ultimate UNK of the great religious leader or UNK who UNK all on his vision of god STOP 
START to james this vision never quite came despite his appreciation of it in others STOP 
START but there is a dignity and even a UNK of the inspired UNK in his words to one correspondent you ask what i am going to reply to UNK STOP 
START but why need one reply to everything and everybody think that readers generally hate minute UNK and UNK STOP 
START all UNK of ours should i believe be either very broad statements of contrast or fine points treated UNK and as far as possible UNK STOP 
START as far as the rising generation goes why not simply express ourselves UNK and trust that the UNK view quietly will UNK the other STOP 
START here again god will know his own STOP 
START the collected works of james UNK now UNK 25 volumes including the present exhibit represent a high standard of literary excellence as every UNK knows STOP 
START the UNK quality of his drawings UNK to that of UNK UNK on a UNK wall is equally well known STOP 
START about all that remains to be said is that the present selection most of which appeared first in the new UNK UNK as usual a slightly UNK UNK held together by little more than a slender thread UNK inserted in the UNK of the book STOP 
START the one UNK note if any is sounded in the initial article entitled how to get through the day STOP 
START it is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate UNK for UNK the UNK and others forced to rely on inner resources including in the UNK alone UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the tyranny of UNK suggests arbitrary UNK associations to UNK UNK STOP 
START and new UNK of UNK UNK are opened by UNK UNK entitled friends UNK UNK lend me your UNK such a phrase as UNK through dream and the new UNK STOP 
START some of UNK UNK methods involve strong UNK of mixed UNK UNK and UNK and are recommended for use only in extreme cases STOP 
START a UNK UNK entitled UNK the herald tribune times and all the other angels sing UNK UNK in UNK even UNK UNK STOP 
START how the UNK UNK features an UNK accurate UNK on UNK UNK who attempt to UNK UNK UNK and the UNK of the night is a UNK waking UNK STOP 
START a UNK literary document entitled the wings of henry james is UNK if only for a UNK UNK though UNK comment on the UNK difficult later period by modest owen UNK author of the UNK STOP 
START james he remarks in a letter to a friend is attempting the impossible namely to produce upon the reader as a painting produces upon the UNK a number of UNK UNK impressions STOP 
START he would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once and get all at once the various UNK and UNK STOP 
START equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation so much has already been written about everything that you can't find out anything about it STOP 
START or the UNK UNK UNK also a UNK woman's place is in the wrong STOP 
START who but UNK can be counted on to UNK such UNK UNK tribute to UNK UNK seems terribly funny though it would be hard to explain why STOP 
START one of them UNK the UNK of the window nearest my bed around midnight in july and i leaped out of sleep and out of bed STOP 
START it's just a bat said my wife UNK and i sighed with relief STOP 
START thank god for that i said i thought it was a human being STOP 
START in a sense perhaps UNK is UNK UNK to the UNK painter was it UNK UNK who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the UNK STOP 
START that is it is literally a picture window you don't see into the UNK see a picture trees or flowers STOP 
START this is something like what UNK best effects are like if i am not mistaken STOP 
START though no longer able to turn out his UNK UNK sketches several old favorites are scattered through the present volume UNK has retained UNK his vision of humor as a thing of simple UNK UNK STOP 
START in his UNK paragraph he writes the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can STOP 
START for many readers UNK comes closer than anyone else in sight STOP 
START the latest low is a UNK STOP 
START the UNK hand has lost none of its craft STOP 
START he is at his usual best in UNK the UNK and UNK of political and diplomatic life in the fifties STOP 
START the reader meets a few old friends like UNK and the UNK horse and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself and civilization in her classic UNK watching the nuclear arms race her hair standing straight out STOP 
START but there is a difference between the present volume and the early low STOP 
START there is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show STOP 
START but there was terror in the UNK when the nazis were on the loose and in those days low struck like lightning STOP 
START anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference STOP 
START it might be argued that the communists are less UNK than the nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key STOP 
START but this argument cannot be pushed very far because the communist system makes up for any UNK of its leaders in respect to UNK STOP 
START the communists UNK a power unknown to UNK STOP 
START and the leading issue that of UNK UNK remains the same STOP 
START this is drama enough STOP 
START do we ourselves offer mr. low less of a UNK the UNK we would not face our enemy was a UNK situation and low was in his element STOP 
START now we have stood up to the communists are stronger and more UNK and low cannot so easily put us to rights STOP 
START or does the reason for less UNK drawings lie elsewhere might be that low has seen too many UNK and that they do not UNK him now STOP 
START he writes UNK held that in times of stress one should take short views only up to UNK STOP 
START whatever the cause his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK does not seem to have caught the UNK of the man STOP 
START UNK skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their UNK STOP 
START UNK seems to have supported UNK at first and then UNK because things worked out differently so there is no fire in his eye STOP 
START UNK death UNK farewell to public life UNK and UNK on UNK UNK and UNK all subjects for a noble anger or an UNK STOP 
START instead the UNK seem to deal with UNK STOP 
START their eisenhower is UNK STOP 
START did low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections often drew the bomb STOP 
START he showed UNK men attacked by UNK UNK machines STOP 
START and khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most UNK UNK of them all STOP 
START but but and but STOP 
START look in this book for weak UNK and only on occasion for virtues and UNK on the heroic scale STOP 
START read the UNK brief text not for UNK sometimes for UNK UNK once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas STOP 
START a gray fox with a patch on one eye confidence man city UNK UNK specialist tries to take over UNK bend in this third relaxed UNK from mr. UNK UNK louisiana animal community STOP 
START the fox is all UNK smiles when he UNK from new orleans accompanied by one UNK UNK STOP 
START but like all UNK as he UNK his following from among the UNK he grows more threatening toward those who won't follow such solid citizens as doc UNK black the UNK black snake the UNK who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in washington UNK for UNK pieces STOP 
START as soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the UNK he imports more UNK UNK who of course say they are the UNK victims of an UNK campaign in the city STOP 
START the followers of UNK invariably are UNK about the very things they plan to do to others STOP 
START they train the UNK and other animals to fight STOP 
START and pretty soon gray fox is UNK that he won't have anyone around that's against him and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds STOP 
START robert UNK the poet writes in his introduction to this brief animal UNK that mr. UNK ought to win a UNK prize for the UNK bend series STOP 
START he may have a point in UNK that UNK UNK be given fewer UNK STOP 
START but it's hard to imagine mr. UNK as a UNK UNK on the basis of these charming but not really UNK UNK STOP 
START in substance they lie somewhere between the southern UNK animal stories of joel chandler harris uncle UNK and the polished UNK UNK of james UNK STOP

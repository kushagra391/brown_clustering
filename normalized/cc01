START certainly not in orchestra hall where he has played countless UNK and where thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the chicago symphony orchestra playing the UNK concerto with his own UNK UNK UNK melting into the high pale pure and lovely song with which a UNK UNK the heart of the music or forever finds it closed STOP 
START there was about that song something UNK for this UNK was UNK at white heat STOP 
START not the UNK performance we have heard him play or the most UNK or even the most eloquent STOP 
START those would be reserved for the UNK great nights when the UNK can UNK himself STOP 
START this time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood STOP 
START but he had in walter UNK a willing conductor able only up to a point STOP 
START that is when mr. UNK thrust straight to the core of the music UNK flying bow UNK violin singing UNK and sometimes UNK mr. UNK could go along STOP 
START but mr. UNK does not go straight to any point STOP 
START he UNK and UNK music UNK STOP 
START there was in the UNK none of the mysterious and marvelous UNK by which a great conductor can bring UNK orchestra and music to ultimate fusion STOP 
START so we had some UNK and memorable UNK but not great UNK STOP 
START the concert opened with another big romantic score UNK UNK to UNK which suffered fate this time with UNK UNK to the UNK point to keep it UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK with UNK UNK was a considerably more serious UNK for it demands UNK UNK UNK rhythms and UNK wit STOP 
START it got the kind of UNK UNK performance that can happen to best of UNK when the man with the UNK UNK technique and style STOP

START but UNK a miracle and don't hold your breath for it chicago will not see the UNK ballet which stems from the ballet UNK of the UNK and is one of the great companies of the world STOP 
START before you let loose a UNK saying we announced its coming not once but several times indeed we did STOP 
START the engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in UNK place which UNK UNK ballet UNK extraordinary considers the finest house of its kind in the country and of course he doesn't weep at the capacity either STOP 
START it was all set STOP 
START allied arts corporation first listed the chicago dates as dec. 4 thru 10 STOP 
START later the UNK office made it dec. 8 thru 17 a nice long UNK for the full UNK STOP 
START but if you keep a calendar of events as we do you noticed a conflict STOP 
START allied arts had UNK UNK UNK into UNK place dec. 8 and 9 STOP 
START something had to give STOP

START allied arts then UNK us that the UNK would cut short its los angeles UNK fly here to open nov. 28 and close dec. 2 STOP 
START shorter UNK but still a UNK STOP

START a couple of days later a UNK told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake STOP 
START so i started making some calls of my own STOP 
START these are the results STOP 
START the UNK ballet is firmly UNK into the UNK auditorium los angeles nov. 21 thru dec. 4 STOP 
START not a chance of opening here nov. 28 UNK that miracle STOP 
START then why not the UNK UNK UNK had held for us UNK won't UNK from UNK place STOP

START h e. UNK has UNK a UNK called UNK UNK the UNK is one of the most entertaining and UNK novels of the season STOP 
START if there is a moral UNK among the UNK it is hard to find STOP 
START perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in england still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged UNK STOP 
START anyway a number of them meet here in UNK UNK STOP 
START one is an imperial london UNK called UNK STOP 
START another is a UNK UNK called UNK whose UNK UNK progress has been UNK i believe in earlier volumes of mr. UNK comedie UNK STOP 
START what's up now UNK and his wife UNK have reached the stage of UNK that UNK a UNK for the more UNK expensive UNK UNK STOP 
START they want to own a UNK UNK or a UNK house or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have staged a UNK for great elizabeth and all her UNK UNK STOP 
START they are willing to settle however in anything that offers UNK to shoot at and peasants to work at STOP 
START and of course UNK has just the thing they want STOP 
START UNK by UNK it's a horror STOP 
START the name of it is UNK court and it is surrounded by a UNK that would UNK t. s. UNK STOP 
START that's not precisely the way UNK UNK them to look at it though STOP 
START he UNK UNK of deer and wild birds UNK the air STOP 
START he suggests that UNK court UNK all the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK windows may have developed UNK UNK the UNK may be no more durable than the UNK in a political platform STOP 
START the vast UNK UNK may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch STOP 
START UNK has an answer to all that STOP 
START the UNK of the UNK cooking areas for example will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern UNK UNK and maids STOP 
START also perhaps UNK and other UNK sports to keep them fit and UNK STOP 
START it's a wonder really to how much UNK trouble UNK puts himself to sell the UNK that UNK UNK STOP 
START he doesn't really need the immense sum of money probably converted from american gold on the london exchange he makes them pay STOP 
START for UNK is already wonderfully UNK with his lot STOP 
START he has a glorious wife and many children STOP 
START when he needs money to buy something like say the UNK he keeps near his UNK patch he takes a UNK in the sale of surplus army supplies STOP 
START one of those UNK UNK in fact has UNK him with UNK court STOP 
START he is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands STOP 
START and the UNK are more than willing to buy it STOP 
START they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a UNK life on earth STOP 
START first one then the other if in UNK eyes they are nothing but UNK farmers he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living STOP 
START mr. UNK shows us how this mutual education UNK its inevitable UNK STOP 
START UNK is UNK by both sides in a total war STOP 
START first the UNK are ahead then the UNK STOP 
START after UNK has been persuaded to UNK his UNK acres with UNK he UNK only what he needs for the UNK of his family and local UNK STOP 
START one of the local UNK a retired UNK apparently left over from UNK tales of india does not approve of the way UNK gets his birds STOP 
START he doesn't think that UNK them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a UNK glass of beer for UNK is entirely UNK STOP 
START but the UNK UNK on the birds with UNK STOP 
START it is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from UNK de UNK don UNK is the brilliant russian spectacle done in wide screen and color which opened yesterday at the UNK street and UNK street UNK STOP 
START more than a beautiful UNK of the UNK adventures and UNK of the UNK UNK and his UNK UNK UNK in UNK UNK this inevitably UNK rendering of the classic UNK on UNK is an UNK warm and human UNK of character STOP 
START UNK UNK the russian actor who has played such heroic roles as alexander UNK and UNK the terrible UNK the UNK don UNK and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner UNK and the surface UNK of this UNK man STOP 
START his UNK UNK UNK to the ridiculous position in an age when UNK had already been UNK to UNK and the UNK code of UNK had become a joke is as UNK no doubt intended a UNK but UNK symbol of good moving UNK and UNK in a world of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK does not UNK him as some actors have been inclined to do STOP 
START he treats this UNK UNK UNK UNK with tangible affection and respect STOP 
START directed by UNK UNK in a UNK that is UNK slow he develops a sense of a high tradition shining UNK and passing UNK through an UNK world STOP 
START the UNK of communication have been considerably UNK in this case by UNK UNK english language that has been UNK UNK in place of the russian dialogue STOP 
START the voices of all the characters including that of UNK have UNK UNK or color to UNK with the personalities STOP 
START and the UNK of the dialogue are most UNK UNK STOP 
START since russian was being spoken instead of spanish there is no violation of UNK or logic here STOP 
START splendid too is the performance of UNK UNK one of russia's leading UNK as UNK UNK the fat UNK UNK STOP 
START though his character is broader and more UNK rounded than the don he gives it a UNK and UNK a sort of UNK dignity too STOP 
START it is really as though the russians have seen in this character the UNK underlying vitality and courage of supposed UNK STOP 
START the episode in which UNK UNK UNK the joke that is played on him when he is UNK put in command of an island is one of the best in the film STOP 
START true the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit UNK in the first half before don UNK goes to the UNK court STOP 
START but strength and UNK develop UNK and the UNK and UNK UNK gather the UNK of realization of the UNK of the old boy STOP 
START there are other good UNK of peasants and people of the court by actors who are UNK UNK and UNK UNK in this last of the russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange STOP 
START also on the bill at the UNK street is a nice UNK color film called sunday in greenwich village a tour of the UNK and joints STOP

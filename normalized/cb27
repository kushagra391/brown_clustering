START confrontation it seems to me that UNK in his editorial confrontation UNK UNK 25 has hit upon the real problem that UNK all of us in a complex world how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer affects us all UNK and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress STOP 
START i know of no other solution than the one UNK UNK to do what we can for each UNK as he UNK us hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place STOP 
START never have i seen this expressed so clearly and so UNK STOP 
START thank you for the illustrated editorial confrontation STOP 
START it is both great writing and profound religion STOP 
START UNK has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece STOP 
START i feel that UNK hit the very core of our existence in the editorial confrontation STOP 
START personally it meant a great deal only hope is that it will be shared by many many others STOP 
START confrontation should UNK us all whether in southeast asia or the u.s. STOP 
START UNK to UNK for successfully UNK into the heart of the problems that face the peace corps STOP 
START i UNK that it is necessary for americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands STOP 
START it would be UNK to see UNK and hence effective leadership UNK by the poverty and UNK which young americans will run into STOP 
START the editorial confrontation was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in america STOP 
START i personally gained strength from it STOP 
START thanks for continuing to capture the attention and UNK so many areas of need in this amazing world STOP 
START UNK editorial confrontation is a UNK piece of writing STOP 
START i would hope that UNK UNK will encourage everyone entering the peace corps to read it STOP 
START the important people to humanity are not the UNK and the UNK but the UNK and the UNK and the others like them whose names we will never know STOP 
START UNK note UNK of confrontation will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the peace corps STOP 
START a peace corps official described the editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be peace corps volunteers STOP 
START UNK UNK l. UNK article in UNK april 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible STOP 
START i certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers rather than the comment by cleveland UNK in his first of the month column STOP 
START it is blind UNK UNK to say UNK around with the king james version seems to us a UNK sport at best STOP 
START facts in focus lester UNK is on the right track in his article interpretation of interpretation UNK UNK 11 STOP 
START the current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably UNK in UNK the press and its readers from UNK by that combination of UNK fact fancy and personal opinion called yellow journalism which UNK in this country more than a generation ago STOP 
START we don't need this type of protection any more STOP 
START the public is now armed with UNK and numerous competing media STOP 
START besides there are no longer enough UNK UNK about STOP 
START the accepted method of writing news has two major UNK STOP 
START first it does not communicate STOP 
START a reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute for instance is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute STOP 
START second it subjects the news to UNK by the UNK STOP 
START the charges by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but UNK the nation STOP 
START yet the press was UNK to put these charges in perspective in its news columns STOP 
START despite several years of UNK stories the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of UNK until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of UNK STOP 
START the senator had UNK them in with their own restrictions STOP 
START it seems to me the time has come for the american press to start UNK with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of UNK and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to UNK the present stereotype to serve their own ends STOP 
START the objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors STOP 
START southern california UNK i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news UNK concerning president kennedy's activities so far as southern california is concerned STOP 
START you have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a UNK press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions STOP 
START to begin with the UNK los angeles times does not UNK a UNK of these press conferences STOP 
START i am sure that they did when eisenhower was president STOP 
START next because of the time differential the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day STOP 
START up until now the networks have UNK run UNK UNK at 5 p.m. or sometimes 7 or UNK p.m. STOP 
START even then a few of the less interesting questions are UNK out and UNK UNK by a UNK STOP 
START however last night the UNK were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on tv were a few UNK which douglas UNK and UNK and UNK could squeeze into their programs STOP 
START this is no criticism of them as they obviously cannot get a UNK program into a UNK news summary STOP 
START the radio stations did run UNK i thought during the evening hours STOP 
START however by UNK the tv UNK two different radio station UNK and the UNK los angeles times version i found that the radio stations had UNK out questions UNK removed the one regarding laos or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president's answer STOP 
START i am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the abuse he is being subjected to STOP 
START we out here don't see enough of the conference to know he is being UNK STOP 
START i don't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country it is not STOP 
START it also happened with the UNK which was not UNK at all during the evening hours and i wrote to the tv editor of the times STOP 
START he did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local UNK not doing this but nothing happened STOP 
START can you bring the UNK attention to this a college of propaganda i was interested in james UNK UNK madison avenue column in which he raised the question do we need a college of propaganda UNK feb. 11 STOP 
START in my UNK we definitely do the sad part of it is that we had one which was UNK into excellent shape and we let it UNK and die STOP 
START during the war we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare which included the teaching of propaganda both black and white and the various shades of grey in between STOP 
START we had a couple of schools in this country the principal one being on the marshall field estate out in UNK neck STOP 
START there were also a couple in canada and several in england STOP 
START the english schools preceded ours and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching STOP 
START four of us here in the united states attended first as students then as UNK almost every one of these schools in england canada and the united states STOP 
START we set up the UNK neck school worked out its curriculum and taught there STOP 
START toward the end of the war we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it STOP 
START when the end did come and the schools were UNK and abandoned we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to UNK STOP 
START we hoped that its UNK and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for UNK courses each year or so STOP 
START UNK no such thing happened STOP 
START there apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare STOP 
START a study at the pentagon and at the service UNK revealed that nothing was being done there STOP 
START and not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way STOP 
START UNK on the article do we need a college of propaganda is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years and i certainly hope it UNK some action STOP 
START let the media clean house too many of us in public relations were UNK that richard l. UNK chose to devote his editorial in the march 11 communications supplement to the merger of the public relations society of america and the american public relations association STOP 
START snow storm i was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of march 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published STOP 
START whether in his forthcoming book c. p. snow UNK the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily UNK critic charged him is important STOP 
START one should be able to get hold of the book at once STOP 
START but the attack was made from an advance copy STOP 
START if this practice should take root and spread the man who UNK a UNK to a UNK will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK note sir robert UNK wrote on page 50 of UNK research for 4 march 1961 i have read an advance copy of the snow book which is to be titled science and government STOP 
START until the work actually appears i am not UNK to UNK it publicly in detail STOP 
START but i have compared its text with already published UNK on the 1960 series of UNK lectures at harvard from which the book was derived and i can with confidence challenge the UNK of c. p. UNK UNK tale STOP 
START UNK remarks in UNK did not then constitute a review of the book but a UNK to the UNK lectures STOP 
START representatives of harvard university press which is publishing the book this month of april recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing life magazine to print an UNK from the book in advance of the UNK publication date STOP 
START the text of the book leaves a somewhat UNK impression than the UNK UNK STOP 
START sir robert UNK UNK of sir charles UNK UNK lectures is UNK throughout by too UNK a desire to defend UNK and apparently himself from sir UNK supposed UNK while stating those UNK in an UNK UNK argument STOP 
START the article presents the reader with an UNK at its beginning STOP 
START it calls the conclusion admitted valid by historians and military UNK alike a UNK conclusion STOP 
START nonsense STOP 
START it UNK an enthusiastic UNK conception of UNK contributing another aspect of the man but on no more UNK basis than sir UNK account STOP 
START we are left to choose between the two UNK STOP 
START the only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party STOP 
START but we are to believe that UNK actively supported radar outside the UNK committee and UNK UNK it inside so i would lean to sir UNK conception of the man STOP 
START i think it was a grave error to print the article at this time STOP 
START to the unfortunate people unable to attend the UNK lectures it UNK an UNK UNK of UNK over the book which may UNK some people from reading it STOP

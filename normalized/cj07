START the UNK effect UNK UNK and UNK 1950 which is a UNK of the UNK motion of particles by the UNK UNK of the UNK force of the UNK solar radiation causes the dust to UNK into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the earth STOP 
START the UNK velocity varies UNK as the particle size a UNK particle near the orbit of mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years STOP 
START UNK 1955 extends the effects to include the UNK pressure which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag STOP 
START further the UNK radiation i.e. the UNK UNK must UNK away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow UNK in size with a resultant increase in both the UNK effect and the ratio of the UNK force to the UNK force STOP 
START the UNK effect causes the UNK axis of UNK to UNK more rapidly than the UNK axis with a UNK tendency toward circular UNK as the particles move toward the sun STOP 
START also planetary UNK attraction increases the dust concentration near the plane of the UNK as the sun is approached STOP 
START at one UNK unit from the sun the earth's distance the dust UNK are probably nearly circular STOP 
START if such is the case the particles within a distance of about af of the earth will have relative to the earth a UNK energy less than their potential energy and they will be captured into UNK about the earth STOP 
START de UNK 1955 has calculated the times required for these particles to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the UNK effect which in this case causes the UNK to become more and more eccentric without changing the UNK axis STOP 
START this effect can give rise to a blanket of UNK around the earth STOP 
START since there is a UNK loss of UNK material in space because of the radiation effects there must be a UNK UNK otherwise UNK would have disappeared from UNK space STOP 
START there are several possible sources STOP 
START according to UNK 1955 UNK UNK is sufficient to UNK the material UNK into the sun maintaining a fairly steady state STOP 
START UNK UNK are also thought to contribute material STOP 
START it is also possible that some of the dust in the UNK of the earth originated from UNK UNK upon the moon STOP 
START UNK direct measurements of UNK flux one cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the UNK flux in space STOP 
START even in the neighborhood of the earth where information has been obtained both directly and indirectly the derived flux values vary by at least four orders of magnitude STOP 
START this large discrepancy UNK the UNK of the experimental methods and the lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved STOP 
START beyond a few million UNK from the earth but still in the region of the earth's orbit a UNK of the flux of dust is even more UNK STOP 
START at greater distances from the sun the situation is still less certain STOP 
START there are several sources of evidence on the UNK environment STOP 
START direct information has been obtained from rockets and UNK equipped with impact UNK STOP 
START in addition the size distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of UNK may be UNK to the UNK UNK STOP 
START from the brightness of the f component of the solar UNK and the brightness of the UNK light an estimate of the particle sizes UNK and UNK distribution can be derived for regions of space near the UNK plane STOP 
START another important source of evidence only recently receiving much attention is the analysis of UNK dust for a UNK component STOP 
START the UNK of UNK UNK and content of UNK in remote regions are valuable in this category STOP 
START the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth STOP 
START the direct evidence on the UNK environment near the earth is obtained from UNK UNK essentially UNK and from wire UNK instruments are installed on rockets UNK and space UNK STOP 
START UNK the most significant data have been collected from the UNK on 1958 UNK UNK 1 1958 UNK 2 UNK 3 and 1959 UNK UNK 3 STOP 
START these vehicles with large sensitive areas have collected data for long enough times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure STOP 
START many other vehicles with smaller UNK UNK products contribute some information STOP 
START the impact rate on 1958 UNK for UNK events was af for particles of mass greater than af UNK 1960 mass threshold was derived from the UNK UNK and an assumed impact velocity of af STOP 
START the data show daily and UNK variations STOP 
START ninety per cent of the UNK recorded UNK occurred between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate was as much as an order of magnitude STOP 
START one may conclude that most of the detected UNK material is concentrated in UNK streams which UNK the earth's orbit STOP 
START there have been UNK reports from 1958 UNK 2 and the data quoted here are believed to be the more reliable STOP 
START on may 15 a very large increase occurred with af of mass between af and af the next two days the impact rate was af for the next nine days the impact rate was less than af UNK 1960 STOP 
START the data for the first day indicate a UNK stream with a very high concentration of particles and may have led to the high estimates of UNK flux STOP 
START preliminary data from 1959 UNK give an average impact rate of af for masses larger than af for about 1000 events in a UNK period UNK and alexander 1960 STOP 
START the UNK rate varied by less than a factor of UNK STOP 
START the data have not yet been analyzed for UNK variations STOP 
START note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 UNK and that the flux is one fifth as large STOP 
START if one UNK that the average flux did not change between measurements a UNK curve is obtained which UNK the flux of particles larger than a given UNK to the UNK 7 power of the UNK STOP 
START space UNK have yielded little information STOP 
START pioneer 1 recorded a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours STOP 
START with UNK sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts the second and third russian space UNK indicate that the flux of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones STOP 
START being based on so few events these results are of UNK validity STOP 
START the UNK of UNK UNK in terms of the particle UNK is very uncertain STOP 
START many workers believe that the response is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles a relation UNK from laboratory results UNK UNK to UNK UNK STOP 
START however one must expect that UNK and UNK of material by UNK UNK would cause a deviation from a linear relationship STOP 
START in the united states most of the UNK are UNK by dropping small UNK on their sensitive surfaces STOP 
START the russian UNK claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the UNK is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder being momentum of UNK material from the UNK STOP 
START this UNK momentum is UNK related to the particle energy STOP 
START they quote about the same mass threshold as that of the u.s. apparatus but a momentum threshold about 40 times greater STOP 
START there is a difference in the experimental arrangement in that the u.s. UNK are attached directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instruments are isolated from the skin STOP 
START the threshold mass is derived from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of af in the u.s. work and af in the UNK work STOP 
START the threshold mass of about af UNK to a UNK sphere of density af STOP 
START however the conversion from mass to size is UNK since many photographic UNK give evidence of a UNK loosely bound UNK structure with UNK as low as af STOP 
START to what extent such low density applies to UNK is unknown STOP 
START the velocity value used is also open to some question a substantial fraction of the dust is UNK about the earth only about one third the UNK average velocity should be used in UNK the mass STOP 
START UNK light and the UNK give some evidence for such a dust blanket a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular UNK about the sun as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible UNK STOP 
START the UNK variation in the observed flux may be partly due to the dependence of the UNK sensitivity on the incident velocity STOP 
START the flux of UNK in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimated by UNK from radar and visual UNK data STOP 
START a summary of UNK data prepared by UNK 1958 on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence is given in table UNK STOP 
START from an estimated mass of 25 g for a UNK UNK the other masses are derived with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of UNK for each unit increase in magnitude STOP 
START the UNK is calculated from the mass by assuming UNK of density af except for the smallest particles which must have a higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of UNK pressure STOP 
START the flux values are for all particles with masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the numbers of visual UNK STOP 
START it is assumed that the flux values increase by a factor of UNK per magnitude in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant STOP 
START the values agree with the data from 1958 UNK and 1959 UNK STOP 
START the figures in the UNK column are derived with the assumption of 50 per cent UNK by the earth these figures apply immediately above the earth's atmosphere STOP 
START the UNK flux is given in the last column figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in UNK space near the earth STOP 
START of course if there is a dust blanket around the earth the UNK in UNK space should be less than the figures given here STOP 
START note that the mass scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously used example UNK 1948 derived a scale of UNK g for a af UNK UNK STOP 
START the older UNK were based on theoretical estimates of the conversion efficiency of UNK energy into light STOP 
START the mass scale used in table UNK was derived on the assumption that the motion of the UNK trail is related to the momentum transfer to the trail by the UNK UNK the calculation of the mass if the velocity is known cook and UNK 1958 STOP 
START a concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations sensitive to the UNK magnitude UNK and UNK 1959 STOP 
START UNK of this relationship through the UNK magnitude covers the range of UNK STOP 
START the approximate equation is af where n is the number of af with electron UNK greater than or equal to af and q is proportional to the mass of the UNK STOP 
START therefore n is UNK proportional to the UNK UNK and in fair agreement with the UNK 7 power derived from 1958 UNK and 1959 UNK data STOP 
START at the UNK magnitude af and at the UNK magnitude af STOP 
START these UNK UNK are about an order of magnitude less than the values from the UNK data and the figures in UNK table STOP 
START the UNK may be in error for several reasons STOP 
START the UNK data determining the concentration distribution have a range of error which is UNK in the extension into the UNK region STOP 
START the UNK and UNK pressure and the associated UNK effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size UNK and UNK the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few UNK STOP 
START also it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same as that for visual or radar UNK best 1960 and the same distribution would not be expected STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK indications of UNK flux a measure of the total mass UNK of UNK material by the earth is obtained from analyses of UNK UNK and dust collected in remote regions UNK 1960 STOP 
START most UNK material by the time it reaches the earth's surface has been reduced to dust or to UNK of UNK material in its passage through the atmosphere STOP 
START for all UNK the average UNK content is about UNK per cent STOP 
START this is much higher than the UNK content of UNK UNK and UNK and provides a basis for the determination of the UNK mass UNK STOP 
START present data indicate an UNK of about af tons per year over the entire globe or about af STOP

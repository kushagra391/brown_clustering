START in the past the duties of the state as sir henry UNK noted long ago were only two in number internal order and external security STOP 
START by prevailing over other UNK for the UNK of men the UNK maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders STOP 
START outside those limits it asserted as against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against the UNK peoples of the UNK world a position of dominance STOP 
START it became the sole subject of international law a term which it is pertinent to remember was UNK by UNK a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world UNK STOP 
START that UNK of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries STOP 
START speaking generally it UNK and still tends to further the interests of the western powers STOP 
START the enormous changes in world politics have however thrown it into confusion so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of UNK and UNK in light of the social conditions of the present era STOP 
START beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility either UNK or UNK STOP 
START this was particularly true in the world UNK which was an UNK UNK characterized by UNK and UNK competition for colonial UNK STOP 
START that any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have UNK a nineteenth-century statesman STOP 
START his duty was to his sovereign and to his nation and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be UNK STOP 
START thus to UNK but one example the UNK UNK of the nineteenth century whether with the british navy ruling the UNK or with the city of london ruling world finance was strictly national in motivation however much other nations e.g. the united states may have incidentally UNK STOP 
START at the same time all suggestions that some sort of UNK responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly UNK STOP 
START social UNK was able to UNK off the UNK socialist movement until well into the present century STOP 
START however in recent decades for what doubtless are multiple reasons an UNK but UNK readily UNK shift has occurred in both UNK of national activity STOP 
START a concept of responsibility is in process of UNK and establishment STOP 
START already firmly UNK UNK it is a growing factor in external matters STOP 
START a little more than twenty years ago the american people turned an important corner STOP 
START in what has UNK been called a constitutional revolution the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature the UNK state to one with UNK duties to perform STOP 
START the positive state came into existence STOP 
START for lawyers reflecting perhaps their parochial UNK there has been a special UNK since then in the role played by the supreme court in that transformation the manner in which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine president UNK UNK but in effect UNK UNK plan the UNK of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation STOP 
START of greater importance however is the content of those programs which have had and are having enormous consequences for the american people STOP 
START labor relations have been transformed income security has become a UNK feature of political UNK and all the many UNK of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom STOP 
START a national UNK of near UNK exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary STOP 
START UNK in the republican party victory in 1952 the positive state is now evidenced by political campaigns being UNK not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be STOP 
START the general acceptance of the idea of governmental i.e. UNK responsibility for the economic UNK of the american people is surely one of the two most significant UNK in american constitutional history STOP 
START the other of course was the civil war the conflict which a century ago UNK national unity over UNK STOP 
START a third one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance is now being UNK american UNK and involvement in world affairs STOP 
START internal national responsibility now a UNK need not be UNK STOP 
START nevertheless it may be helpful to UNK one example that of employment for as will be shown below it cuts across both UNK of the new concept STOP 
START thirty years ago while the nation was UNK in economic depression the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow natural forces to operate and cure the distress STOP 
START that UNK principle of the UNK administration fell to the UNK guns of the new deal than a score of years later congress enacted the employment act of 1946 by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment STOP 
START UNK the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning the economic side of the constitutional revolution STOP 
START in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a UNK proposal provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by UNK taxation rather than by a UNK only on those states UNK with manpower surplus STOP 
START the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 STOP 
START internal national responsibility is a UNK response to the impact of the industrial revolution STOP 
START reduced to its UNK terms it is an assumption of a collective duty to UNK for the inability of individuals to cope with the UNK of the era STOP 
START national responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the united states or even to the western nations STOP 
START a measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the international congress of UNK in 1959 STOP 
START meeting in new UNK under the UNK of the international commission of UNK a body of lawyers from the free world the congress UNK and expanded the traditional rule of law to include UNK governmental duties STOP 
START it is UNK that the majority of the delegates to the congress were from the less developed former colonial nations STOP 
START the rule of law historically a principle according everyone his day in court before an UNK UNK was UNK UNK by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare STOP 
START UNK that the rule of law is a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to UNK the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society the congress asserted that it also included the responsibility to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized STOP 
START the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the UNK world STOP 
START for better or for worse we all now live in welfare states the UNK principle of which is collective responsibility for individual UNK STOP 
START whether a concept UNK to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish STOP 
START the hypothesis UNK here is that it does and that evidence is UNK UNK that proposition STOP 
START the content is not the same however rather than individual security it is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group those in the free world that is basic STOP 
START external national responsibility involves a UNK requirement that the leaders of the western nations so guide their decisions as to further the UNK of other friendly nations STOP 
START if internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility implies UNK to principles of ideological UNK STOP 
START reference to two other concepts nationalism and sovereignty may help to reveal the contours of the new principle STOP 
START in its UNK the UNK had to struggle to assert itself UNK against UNK groups and UNK against the power and influence of such other UNK for loyalty as the church STOP 
START the UNK of the holy roman empire and the UNK of UNK led not more than two centuries ago to the UNK of nationalism STOP 
START since the UNK of the UNK UNK roughly with the separate existence of the united states as an independent UNK it is perhaps natural for americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order something permanent and UNK STOP 
START the concept of nationalism is the political principle that UNK and UNK the territorial state as the characteristic type of UNK structure STOP 
START but it is more than that STOP 
START for it includes the emotional ties that UNK men to their UNK and the complex UNK that hold a large group of people together as a unit STOP 
START today as new nations rise from the former colonial UNK nationalism is one of the UNK forces loose in the world STOP 
START almost UNK in intensity the principle has become UNK in application unfortunately at the very time that UNK UNK can UNK greatest harm STOP 
START historically however the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the western UNK group STOP 
START by UNK UNK lesser groups the nation has to some degree at least UNK the capacity for individual liberty STOP 
START within their UNK moreover technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace thus increasing the UNK from which material wants can be satisfied STOP 
START while the pattern is UNK some having gained more than others nationalism has in fact served the western peoples well STOP 
START whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects are other questions STOP 
START it is one of the ironic UNK of history that the UNK and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly UNK at precisely the time that the UNK UNK its highest number approximately 100 STOP 
START but it is more than irony one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a UNK concept is because it has spread throughout the planet STOP 
START in other words nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application both as to UNK and as to population becomes a UNK UNK when adopted on a world-wide basis STOP 
START UNK the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty STOP 
START the former receives its UNK from the latter STOP 
START operating side by side together they helped shore up the UNK STOP 
START while sovereignty has roots in UNK in its present usage it is essentially modern STOP 
START jean UNK writing in the sixteenth century may have been the UNK UNK but it was the UNK influential john austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood STOP 
START UNK nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still UNK much of today's legal and political thinking STOP 
START to him law is the command of the sovereign the english UNK who UNK the power of the nation while sovereignty is the power to make law i.e. to UNK over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other UNK in other nations STOP 
START these fundamental ideas the UNK of sovereignty and its UNK UNK aspects still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power STOP 
START the UNK then UNK the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control STOP 
START in fact however both principles have always been UNK and loosely defined STOP 
START UNK UNK are always difficult to pin down with precision STOP 
START that is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies in which popular sovereignty is said to exist and in federal nations in which the jobs of government are split STOP 
START nevertheless nationalism and sovereignty are UNK in the accepted wisdom to describe the modern world STOP 
START is there a different reality behind the UNK the surface hide a quite different picture short answer to those questions is yes STOP 
START both concepts are undergoing UNK some degree they are being UNK by a concept of national responsibility STOP 
START as evidence to support that view consider the following UNK instances STOP

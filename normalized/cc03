START UNK UNK UNK UNK who made his new york debut three years ago played a return engagement last night in UNK hall STOP 
START he is now president of the chicago UNK college STOP 
START his pianist was donald UNK a faculty member at UNK university STOP 
START the UNK of the small hall had been UNK by the artists so that for the first half of the program when the piano was partially open mr. UNK playing was too loud STOP 
START in UNK with him mr. UNK also seemed to be UNK his tone STOP 
START this was not an UNK UNK to enjoyment of the performances however except in the case of the opening work UNK UNK in a k. UNK which UNK along UNK in an UNK fashion STOP 
START UNK UNK in a although also vigorous stood up well under the two UNK strong UNK treatment STOP 
START mr. UNK has a firm attractive tone which UNK an UNK sweet UNK STOP 
START he made the most of the long UNK phrases and by the UNK and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance STOP 
START a UNK for violin and piano called UNK UNK by robert UNK was given its first united states performance STOP 
START the title refers to the UNK given his wife by the composer who is also a member of the national film board of canada STOP 
START the UNK two movements one UNK sentimental the other UNK UNK are clever enough in a UNK style but they UNK a UNK UNK STOP 
START they might well indicate UNK UNK but in musical terms that UNK of hollywood STOP 
START works by UNK UNK mr. UNK himself and UNK indicated that the UNK had some UNK UNK up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase STOP 
START standard items by UNK and UNK completed the program STOP 
START in recent years UNK UNK has played with the new york UNK and at UNK stadium but her program last night at town hall was the UNK UNK first new york UNK since 1948 STOP 
START miss UNK has a natural UNK for the UNK and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control STOP 
START and the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound STOP 
START since she also has considerable technical UNK and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition miss UNK gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure STOP 
START she played with style and a touch of the grand manner and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures STOP 
START the second half of her program was devoted to russian composers of this century STOP 
START it was in them that miss UNK was at her best STOP 
START the UNK UNK no. 12 UNK 32 for instance gave her an opportunity to UNK one of her special facilities the ability to produce fine UNK bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver UNK in the UNK STOP 
START the four UNK UNK were also assured rich in color and UNK STOP 
START and the prokofieff seventh UNK had the combination of UNK and modern UNK that prokofieff needs STOP 
START miss UNK earlier selections were UNK variations UNK in which each variation was UNK set off from the others UNK in e minor which was UNK pleasant in sound and UNK UNK in b flat minor STOP 
START a memory UNK in the last somewhat UNK the UNK performance STOP 
START so what was the deepest music on her program had the UNK showing STOP 
START miss UNK was best when she did not need to be too UNK STOP 
START all the UNK who held important commands in world war 2 did not write books STOP 
START it only seems as if they did STOP 
START and the best books by UNK were not necessarily the first ones written STOP 
START one of the very best is only now published in this country five years after its first publication in england STOP 
START it is defeat into victory by field marshal UNK slim STOP 
START a long book heavily UNK with military UNK in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally STOP 
START field marshal slim has UNK it for the benefit of those who finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and UNK are more interested in men and their reactions to stress UNK and danger STOP 
START the man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is of course the field marshal himself STOP 
START william joseph slim first UNK slim former governor general of australia was the principal british commander in the field during the burma war STOP 
START he had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the UNK UNK british forces were UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START he returned in command of an international army of UNK indians UNK chinese and british STOP 
START and in a series of bitterly fought UNK in the UNK and hills and along the great rivers of burma he UNK one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war STOP 
START the forgotten war his soldiers called the burma fighting because the war in africa and europe enjoyed UNK in equipment and in UNK STOP 
START parts of defeat into victory are a UNK of UNK place names and military units but a little application makes everything clear enough STOP 
START on the whole this is an interesting and UNK UNK book STOP 
START field marshal slim is striking in description amusing in many UNK STOP 
START he has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even a cardinal error STOP 
START he UNK many individuals UNK STOP 
START he himself seems to be tough UNK able and intelligent more intellectual and UNK than most soldiers STOP 
START UNK an army to win defeat into victory is a dramatic and lively military narrative STOP 
START but it is most interesting in its account of the UNK problems of high command of decisions and their reasons of the UNK matters that demand attention in addition to battle action STOP 
START before he could return to burma field marshal slim had to UNK the defeated UNK of a discouraged army and UNK them with fresh UNK STOP 
START his remarks about training discipline morale leadership and command are UNK STOP 
START he believed in making UNK speeches and he made a great many STOP 
START he believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there STOP 
START for general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers when food was short for combat troops he cut the UNK of his headquarters staff accordingly STOP 
START other crucial matters required constant supervision labor and all UNK troops whose morale was vital too organization and delicate diplomatic relations with top brass british american and chinese UNK medical aid and preventive medicine inadequate and UNK UNK and military supplies and transport and UNK and river UNK to be built STOP 
START expected of a commander UNK on these and other matters field marshal slim makes many frank and UNK remarks when in doubt as to two courses of action a general should choose the UNK STOP 
START the commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory for that is his duty STOP 
START it only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them STOP 
START it UNK them STOP 
START so i made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it STOP 
START field marshal slim is more impressed by the courage of japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their UNK STOP 
START of the japanese private he says he fought and UNK till he died STOP 
START if 500 japanese were ordered to hold a position we had to kill UNK before it was ours and then the last five killed themselves STOP 
START brooding about future wars the field marshal has this to say the UNK fighting man is at least equally brave as the white usually more UNK of death less UNK by mental doubts less troubled by UNK sentiment and not so moved by UNK and UNK around him STOP 
START he is by background and living standards better fitted to UNK UNK UNK to demand less in the way of UNK or comfort and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources STOP 
START a bunch of young UNK from out west who go by the name of texas boys UNK UNK into town hall last night and succeeded in UNK the hearts of a sizable audience STOP 
START actually the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and UNK and they sang it beautifully STOP 
START under the capable direction of the UNK UNK UNK UNK the UNK boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of renaissance and baroque UNK and UNK UNK from UNK UNK UNK and all of the UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START their singing was UNK clear and within obvious limitations extremely UNK STOP 
START the limitations are those one expects from UNK and UNK voices an occasional UNK of almost UNK intensity an occasional UNK and now and then a UNK STOP 
START but mr. UNK is a remarkably gifted conductor and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior STOP 
START most surprising of all he has accomplished some UNK in training for the production of words STOP 
START the latin for example was not only clear was even beautiful STOP 
START furthermore there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music STOP 
START lines came out neatly and in good balance STOP 
START UNK were lively STOP 
START the piano UNK by UNK UNK were UNK STOP 
START a boy UNK named UNK UNK sang a UNK UNK UNK and a few other passages UNK STOP 
START other capable UNK included david UNK joseph UNK and pat thompson STOP 
START the final group included folk songs from back home UNK out shouted and UNK with UNK spirit and in cowboy UNK STOP 
START boys will be boys and UNK will be UNK STOP 
START the combination proved quite UNK last night STOP 
START the polish song and dance company called UNK after the region of poland where it has its headquarters opened a UNK engagement at the city center last night STOP 
START a thoroughly UNK company it is and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening STOP 
START not that it is all funny by any means though some of it is definitely so but simply that the dancers are young and handsome UNK and UNK and the program itself is as UNK as it is varied STOP 
START there is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it has a kind of UNK UNK and moves along in an UNK continuity that demands no UNK for identification STOP 
START the material is all basically of folk origin UNK from every section of poland STOP 
START but under the direction of UNK UNK who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 it has all been put into theatrical form treated UNK UNK specifically for presentation to spectators and performed altogether UNK STOP 
START under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training and an equally professional sense of performing STOP 
START since the organization was created thirteen years ago it is obvious that this is not the original company is more likely the sons and daughters of that company STOP 
START the girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and UNK youngsters STOP 
START the stage is constantly full of them there are never fewer than eight of them on stage and that is only for the more intimate numbers STOP 
START they can be UNK or sentimental UNK or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull STOP 
START to pick out particular numbers is something of a problem but one or two UNK items are too UNK excellent to be missed STOP 
START there is for example a UNK UNK that UNK the first act UNK UNK by UNK UNK to music from UNK opera UNK UNK may be the most beautiful UNK you are likely ever to see is an UNK UNK the dances and songs from the UNK contain a magnificent dance for the men STOP 
START everywhere there are little touches of humor and the leader of the UNK band of musicians is an UNK UNK who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth STOP

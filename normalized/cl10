START not since last night STOP 
START i didn't think there was any reason to STOP 
START maybe there isn't STOP 
START speak to him again anyway STOP 
START try talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone STOP 
START try to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with women STOP 
START you might try looking into his wife too STOP 
START she might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been having any trouble STOP 
START you think UNK the one we're looking for yeah STOP 
START i think he might be UNK said grimly STOP 
START then again he might not STOP 
START what a UNK world rourke said STOP 
START black is UNK best friend STOP 
START i know STOP 
START will you be coming back soon i think so STOP 
START i'm on my way to see the UNK woman STOP 
START UNK secretary for don't think gilborn is the i don't think anything STOP 
START i just don't want to go off UNK before picking up black that's all STOP 
START UNK interrupted STOP 
START gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday STOP 
START i'd like to make sure STOP 
START also it's just possible she might know something about mrs. gilborn STOP 
START right STOP 
START i'll see you later STOP 
START aren't you ever going to go home it sure as hell doesn't look like it does it telling you if these UNK ever knew the trouble they put us to they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off STOP 
START remember to tell that to the next UNK you meet STOP 
START UNK hung up and sat on the small UNK bench UNK his right leg STOP 
START he looked at his watch STOP 
START it was ten minutes before eleven STOP 
START he wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from UNK black STOP 
START thirty UNK experience let him know even at this early stage that black was his man STOP 
START but he still wanted to know why STOP 
START it was a cold UNK day the day after UNK death but stanley gilborn paid no attention to the UNK october wind STOP 
START after leaving UNK gilborn had no UNK STOP 
START he simply walked not UNK where he was not UNK STOP 
START he stopped automatically at the street corners waiting for the traffic lights to change UNK of other people his coat open and UNK STOP 
START as he walked he tried to think STOP 
START of kitti STOP 
START of himself STOP 
START mainly of what UNK had tried to make him believe STOP 
START there was nothing UNK about his thinking STOP 
START it was a succession of UNK passing through his mind the same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession STOP 
START the UNK of what UNK had told him made it impossible for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the UNK of it STOP 
START UNK words had intellectual meaning for him only STOP 
START emotionally they UNK him not at all STOP 
START whoever he was and your wife were intimate STOP 
START gilborn remembered UNK exact words STOP 
START they made sense and yet they didn't STOP 
START he knew UNK had told him the truth STOP 
START it was so STOP 
START yet it wasn't so STOP 
START it wasn't so because it couldn't be so STOP 
START when kitti was alive and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm she had been the center of his life STOP 
START she was the sun he the UNK planet UNK around her the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed STOP 
START for UNK years he had lived UNK towards a UNK eating working breathing without plan without reason STOP 
START kitti had come along to justify everything STOP 
START she was his goal she was his reason STOP 
START he had lived all his life waiting for her STOP 
START not once in the time that he had known her had he ever considered the possibility not once not for one UNK of a second of her UNK STOP 
START he could not consider it now STOP 
START not really STOP 
START and so he walked UNK again STOP 
START the walk ended inevitably right in front of his hotel building STOP 
START the UNK began to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what had happened to him the night before STOP 
START he looked at gilborn with UNK curiosity STOP 
START gilborn passed by him without seeing him STOP 
START he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts STOP 
START in the apartment itself all was still STOP 
START the police were no longer there STOP 
START there was no evidence that anything was different than it had been STOP 
START except that kitti wasn't there STOP 
START without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door STOP 
START at last sitting there in the familiar UNK the truth began to sink in STOP 
START who felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had UNK him STOP 
START who was all he had everything he had everything he wanted STOP 
START someone had taken her away from him STOP 
START who there is a UNK entry in the UNK there is a UNK one he remembered from his school days STOP 
START where there is a victim there is a killer STOP 
START who he was and your wife were intimate STOP 
START he rose from the chair took off his coat STOP 
START quickly he went into the bedroom STOP 
START the bed still showed signs of where kitti had UNK STOP 
START gilborn stood there for a long time STOP 
START he looked at the bed UNK STOP 
START the bed was empty now STOP 
START kitti would lie in it no more STOP 
START he would lie in it no more STOP 
START gilborn wondered whether kitti had UNK in that same bed with who thirty minutes stanley gilborn stood there STOP 
START at the end of the UNK UNK his brains thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he left the bedroom STOP 
START who could think of no answer STOP 
START gilborn put on his coat again STOP 
START before leaving he took one last UNK look at the apartment STOP 
START he knew he would never see it again STOP 
START in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley gilborn was a UNK figure STOP 
START on blanche UNK kitti UNK death had a quite different effect STOP 
START for blanche UNK death was a source of guilty but UNK UNK happy hope STOP 
START in UNK defense it must be said she was unaware of the UNK hope STOP 
START if anyone had asked her she would have described herself only as nervous and worried STOP 
START the figures on the UNK paper in front of her were UNK and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the UNK STOP 
START she wondered whether stanley would call STOP 
START she wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and UNK she knew he needed STOP 
START she had UNK her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out STOP 
START he hadn't STOP 
START and now she was feeling sick both from concern about stanley and hunger STOP 
START why hadn't he called she reflected even men like stanley are UNK STOP 
START she tried to think of his UNK actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all STOP 
START stanley really was quite UNK STOP 
START that was one of the things she liked about stanley STOP 
START he wasn't like so many other men STOP 
START the dentist last night for instance STOP 
START dinner and the movies had been fine STOP 
START he had taken her upstairs to say good night STOP 
START she had invited him in for coffee STOP 
START it was in the kitchen as she was watching the UNK waiting for the water to boil that he had grabbed for her STOP 
START without warning without giving her a chance to prepare for it STOP 
START from behind he had put his arms on her shoulders turned her around and pressed her to him so close she couldn't UNK STOP 
START later she UNK for the long UNK across his face tried to explain she couldn't help herself that the panic arose in her UNK STOP 
START but he hadn't understood STOP 
START when he left she knew she would never see him again STOP 
START stanley wasn't like that STOP 
START she could always UNK what stanley was going to do ever since she first met him STOP 
START except for that one morning STOP 
START the morning he walked in to announce to her UNK that he was married STOP 
START she thought she was going to die STOP 
START she had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him STOP 
START blanche couldn't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion STOP 
START she thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for stanley STOP 
START it was nothing that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal STOP 
START she was UNK years old then STOP 
START her mother was already considerably concerned over her UNK future STOP 
START but blanche had been able to maintain a UNK and assured UNK in the face of her UNK mother's continued UNK had been able to resist her UNK to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of UNK STOP 
START for blanche it was only a matter of time before stanley would propose STOP 
START it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in taking such a UNK step STOP 
START stanley went along in life she knew convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman STOP 
START as a result he never looked for it STOP 
START but one day she expected he would somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such a woman in the world woman who was willing to give him love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband STOP 
START indeed there was a woman who UNK had already given him love STOP 
START unquestionably blanche loved stanley STOP 
START and then unexpectedly stanley made his announcement STOP 
START on that first day blanche literally thought she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind STOP 
START it might have been easier for her if kitti walker hadn't been everything that blanche was not STOP 
START kitti was thirty years younger than stanley UNK than stanley UNK than stanley had any right to hope for much less expect STOP 
START kitti could have married a score of men STOP 
START there was no reason for her to marry someone like stanley gilborn there was no need for her to marry stanley STOP 
START kitti had come into the office on UNK recommendation because she needed help in preparing her income tax return STOP 
START stanley had filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close to the lunch hour he had UNK asked kitti to join him never expecting her to accept STOP 
START blanche knew all this because the door to UNK office was open and without UNK too hard she could hear everything that was said STOP 
START stanley had gone out saying he would be back in an hour STOP 
START he hadn't come back for over two STOP 
START after that day blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened STOP 
START there were UNK when stanley came in late afternoons when he left early days when he didn't come in at all STOP 
START blanche knew something must be causing UNK new strange behavior but she never once connected it with kitti walker STOP 
START it was too unprecedented STOP 
START then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office stanley announced he and kitti were married STOP 
START somehow blanche managed to cover the UNK surprise and offer her UNK STOP 
START that night the two of them left for a UNK honeymoon in UNK STOP 
START while they were away blanche came into the office every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley going through the week in a UNK UNK getting things done automatically out of habit STOP 
START for exactly one week she was able to continue in this manner STOP 
START on the morning of UNK return however her strength left her STOP 
START two hours of watching his UNK happy face listening to his soft UNK as he bent over his UNK figures and blanche had to leave STOP 
START she stayed away for ten days STOP 
START those ten days were like no others that blanche had known STOP 
START mostly she stayed in bed STOP 
START she didn't tell anyone even her mother what was wrong STOP 
START she refused to have a doctor UNK there was nothing a doctor could do for her STOP

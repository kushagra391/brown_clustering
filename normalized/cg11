START as cells UNK into UNK they built new UNK and UNK controlled UNK to cope even more successfully with the UNK properties of the external world STOP 
START the useful suggestion of professor david UNK which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial UNK STOP 
START one UNK about its UNK to people STOP 
START will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and UNK acid built a structure of UNK which enabled it to UNK to a sea of molecular interaction answer is of course yes STOP 
START for the family is the UNK example of just such a unit composed of people which gives us both some UNK from and a way of dealing with other people STOP 
START social invention did not have to UNK social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to UNK UNK or the UNK protection of a boat the formulations of UNK STOP 
START but it has been during the last two centuries during the scientific revolution that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid UNK STOP 
START we have ample light when the sun sets temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons fly through the air although UNK UNK us down range of our voice UNK distance STOP 
START at what stage are social sciences then the future of psychology UNK to the rich future of physics at the time of UNK is a UNK resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in UNK STOP 
START and it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact STOP 
START political theoretical understanding although almost at a UNK during this century did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and resulted in a flood of UNK which increased the possibility for man to UNK with man STOP 
START UNK government popular vote trial by jury public education labor unions UNK UNK UNK ownership world courts and the UNK power in world UNK are but a few examples STOP 
START most of these with horrible exceptions were conceived as is a ship not as an attempt to UNK the ocean of mankind nor to deny its force but as a means to survive and enjoy it STOP 
START the most effective political UNK seem to make maximum use of natural UNK and are aware that UNK UNK can play only a minor part in the whole scheme STOP 
START just as present technology had to UNK the explanations of physics so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding STOP 
START we are desperately in the need of such invention for man is still very much at the mercy of man STOP 
START in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other STOP 
START 3 i want therefore to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science the connection between scientific understanding and fear STOP 
START there are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to UNK our present fears STOP 
START UNK has remarked the reason why all UNK are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no UNK cause and these they UNK to the will of god STOP 
START perhaps things were even worse then STOP 
START it is difficult to UNK the UNK fears of man STOP 
START we get some clue from a few UNK of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was STOP 
START we are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared UNK STOP 
START the bombs are as UNK as an automobile in a garage STOP 
START we are worried about what people may do with them that some crazy fool may push the UNK STOP 
START i am certainly not adequately trained to describe or UNK on human fears but there are certain features of the fears UNK by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly STOP 
START they are in general those fears that once seemed to have been UNK to prayer or ritual STOP 
START they include both individual fears and collective ones STOP 
START they arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group STOP 
START often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because the pattern was UNK determined and not developed through theoretical understanding one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective and the whole pattern becomes UNK STOP 
START yet often fear UNK because even with the most rigid ritual one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act STOP 
START to say that science had reduced many such fears merely UNK the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and UNK STOP 
START but a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be UNK STOP 
START the frequently UNK antique worry that the daylight hours might UNK to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize STOP 
START it is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not UNK a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter UNK STOP 
START this and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually first with the ptolemaic system and its UNK concept of UNK and then more firmly with the UNK UNK of an universal force that could account UNK for both UNK and UNK motions STOP 
START this understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without UNK any controls STOP 
START in fact although we have UNK the fear we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers STOP 
START there is still the remote possibility of UNK UNK STOP 
START a UNK could fall on san francisco STOP 
START solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or UNK STOP 
START our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate UNK with the appropriate action which in this case amounts to doing nothing STOP 
START yet we no longer feel uneasy STOP 
START this almost trivial example is nevertheless UNK for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war STOP 
START we in our country think of war as an external threat which if it occurs will not be primarily of our own doing STOP 
START and yet we obviously also believe that the UNK of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave STOP 
START what elements of our behavior are decisive weapons production our world prestige our ideas of democracy our actions of trust or UNK or UNK or UNK have UNK off a war and since our behavior has involved all these elements we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective STOP 
START i think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city STOP 
START if an automobile were approaching him he would know what was required of him even though he might not be able to act quickly enough STOP 
START with the group of boys it is different STOP 
START he does not know whether to look up or look aside to put his hands in his pockets or to UNK them at his side to cross the street or to continue on the same side STOP 
START when confronted with a drunk or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others STOP 
START i believe that what i do has some effect on his actions and i have learned in a way to UNK with UNK but certainly my actions seem to UNK more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics STOP 
START i am usually filled with an UNK that through some UNK slip all hell may break loose STOP 
START our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently UNK the same kind of ritual and UNK STOP 
START we are forced in our behavior towards others to adopt UNK successful patterns in UNK because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements STOP 
START our collective policies group and national are similarly based on UNK but here we often lack even the UNK successful UNK and are still engaged in UNK them STOP 
START we use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as trust UNK and get tough STOP 
START we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talked of the UNK of UNK bodies to move in circles STOP 
START we perform elaborate international UNK and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect STOP 
START small wonder then that we fear STOP 
START the achievements which UNK our fears of the UNK took place three centuries ago STOP 
START what additional roles has the scientific understanding of the UNK and 20th centuries played the physical sciences these achievements concern electricity chemistry and atomic physics STOP 
START in the life sciences there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease in the mechanisms of UNK and in UNK and physiological chemistry STOP 
START the major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and UNK a more protective environment STOP 
START in addition our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed STOP 
START even in UNK where detailed and UNK understanding is still lacking but where some explanations are possible as with lightning and weather and UNK the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated STOP 
START apparently the population as a whole eventually UNK enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to UNK its procedures and its fears STOP 
START how and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study STOP 
START in some areas the progress is UNK than in others STOP 
START in agriculture for example despite the advances in UNK elaborate UNK tend to UNK along with a continued sense of the UNK of some natural disaster STOP 
START in child care the opposite extreme UNK change rapidly and UNK confidence probably UNK anything UNK by established psychological theory STOP 
START there are many UNK in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear STOP 
START much of the former extreme UNK associated with UNK and UNK and with death has disappeared STOP 
START the persistent horror of having a UNK child has i believe been reduced not because we have gained any control over this UNK but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it STOP 
START in fact the recent UNK about the use of UNK have introduced fears and UNK of action which now require more detailed understanding and thus in this instance science has UNK UNK our fears STOP 
START in fact UNK as science UNK any fear it stems not so much from scientific UNK and UNK but from the fact that new UNK questions arise which until they are understood create uncertainty STOP 
START perhaps the most UNK example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease STOP 
START the situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease contains close UNK to problems UNK us with respect to people STOP 
START the fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear i have tried to describe STOP

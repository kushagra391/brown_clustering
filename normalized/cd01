START as a result although we still make use of this distinction there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed STOP 
START just what is meant by spirit and by matter terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and UNK elements in the common experience of all STOP 
START yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do STOP 
START for in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally UNK elements of experience STOP 
START we are in a UNK stage in which many of the UNK of former usage have had to be revised or rejected STOP 
START when the words are used we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the UNK may have in mind or to what extent his UNK and UNK of former UNK UNK to ours STOP 
START one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal UNK in the reality of spirit STOP 
START just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as UNK and real as the world of material entities STOP 
START not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true STOP 
START UNK UNK angels and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the UNK world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars STOP 
START in such a world the words matter and spirit both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all STOP 
START in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general which now cause us much difficulty could be responded to quite naturally and UNK STOP 
START the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent UNK the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it STOP 
START in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit STOP 
START the UNK of the world of spirit in popular UNK had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support STOP 
START science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time STOP 
START when therefore it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had UNK the world of spirit these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality STOP 
START in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread UNK removed UNK and UNK sources of fear and UNK many UNK popular UNK STOP 
START there have been indeed many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be UNK grateful STOP 
START all this has not however been an UNK UNK STOP 
START the scientific UNK of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough STOP 
START the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means or at best with wholly inadequate means for dealing with his experience of spirit STOP 
START although the particular form of UNK which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly UNK the raw experience itself which led to such UNK remains with us as UNK as ever STOP 
START we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for UNK into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience STOP 
START there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality as we know and UNK it with respect to which we can refer this experience STOP 
START science has simply left us helpless and UNK in this important sector of our lives STOP 
START the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur UNK play the UNK which deals with the salem UNK trials STOP 
START as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in UNK america at the end of the eighteenth century STOP 
START aside from a quaint concern with UNK and UNK which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene it is a quite normal community STOP 
START the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of UNK UNK UNK and concerns which would UNK the common life of a normal village in any age STOP 
START there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people STOP 
START instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective of an UNK time which no longer believes in such things enjoy the dead UNK with which the characters in the play take the UNK and UNK which are under discussion STOP 
START a UNK girl UNK williams is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle the reverend samuel UNK about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings STOP 
START for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real UNK who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night the UNK world is populated with real creatures and UNK actually can be seen flying through the air STOP 
START as the play UNK however the audience is UNK brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with UNK gathering power and soon UNK the community STOP 
START everyone in salem saint and UNK alike is swept up by it STOP 
START it is like a mysterious epidemic which starting first with UNK and UNK UNK UNK with a UNK growing UNK through the whole town until all have been UNK by it STOP 
START it grows terribly and UNK in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery moral UNK and destruction STOP 
START the audience leaves the play under a spell it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active UNK always UNK STOP 
START if one asks about this play what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power there is no better answer to give than spirit STOP 
START this is not to attempt to say what spirit is but only to employ a commonly used word to UNK or simply identify a common experience STOP 
START in the end the good man john UNK UNK what the audience has already come to feel when he says a fire a fire is burning hear the boot of UNK i see his UNK face tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and UNK with UNK set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from UNK the real devil when he came among them STOP 
START we UNK at their blindness for not seeing this STOP 
START yet are not we of the UNK century who UNK do not believe there is any such thing as the devil just as bad off as they only in a different way our UNK we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so UNK real in this play STOP 
START we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been UNK and proved false STOP 
START even mr. miller himself seems uncertain on this score STOP 
START in a long UNK which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play he says at one point however that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the UNK or the existence of UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START and his belief is not to his UNK STOP 
START better minds than UNK were and still are convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken STOP 
START page UNK on the other hand a little later on he says since UNK a great but UNK change has wiped out god's beard and the UNK UNK but the world is still gripped between two UNK opposed UNK STOP 
START the concept of unity in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force in which good and evil are relative UNK and always joined to the same phenomenon such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas STOP 
START when we see the steady and UNK UNK into humanity of the idea of man's UNK until UNK the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or UNK STOP 
START page 34 apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real STOP 
START yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and UNK of that which came over salem STOP 
START it UNK a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power STOP 
START it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to UNK it into the UNK of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect STOP 
START for this does not account for the integral elemental power of that which grows with UNK vigor as the play UNK nor does it explain the strange UNK sense of UNK which comes over those who watch the play like a spell STOP 
START the reality of spirit UNK in this play in spite of the UNK convictions to the contrary STOP 
START spirit and community there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and UNK felt than spirit STOP 
START apart from spirit there could be no community for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity UNK and UNK STOP 
START think for example of the spirit of the marine corps STOP 
START surely this is a reality we all acknowledge STOP 
START we cannot of course assign it any substance STOP 
START it is not material and is not a thing UNK space and time STOP 
START yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known STOP 
START so it is too with many other spirits which we all know the spirit of UNK or communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of UNK or the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START every community if it is alive has a spirit and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity STOP 
START in searching for UNK which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most UNK STOP 
START for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit STOP 
START it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to UNK STOP 
START it is the spirit which is the source of a UNK drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and UNK STOP 
START yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community STOP 
START the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and UNK ideas STOP 
START one characteristic of the spirit in community is its UNK STOP 
START the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them STOP 
START it is for them a given which they and they alone possess STOP 
START the spirit of the marine corps was present and UNK before any of the present members of it came into it STOP 
START it is they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future UNK to find as they come into it STOP

START this conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex UNK will continue to sanction both UNK UNK as the ideal and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for UNK the ideal STOP 
START our discussion of this involves using UNK UNK UNK of identity vs. identity diffusion as a UNK tool in UNK a few common UNK onto the diverse personality and family UNK of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier STOP 
START our discussion does not UNK all the identity crises UNK by UNK but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical UNK for studying unwed mothers STOP 
START we hope thereby to emphasize that from a psychological standpoint the UNK prevention of UNK is a continuous long-term process involving the UNK of the female from infancy through adolescence STOP 
START UNK a series of UNK stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age UNK has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises STOP 
START the successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an UNK principle during adolescence the individual's positive UNK in each area of identity crisis depend to a considerable degree on his already having resolved preliminary and UNK identity crises during his infancy childhood and early adolescence STOP 
START within UNK UNK the UNK UNK behavior in this case her unwed UNK reflects her identity diffusion or her inability to resolve these various identity crises UNK STOP 
START the adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion STOP 
START time perspective the ability to plan for the future and to UNK UNK immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives is more easily developed if from infancy on the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives STOP 
START UNK has noted that unless this trust developed early the time UNK experienced in varying degree and temporarily by all UNK as a result of their remembering the more immediate UNK of wants during childhood while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by UNK may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion STOP 
START experience of this time diffusion UNK from a sense of utter UNK to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately STOP 
START these UNK UNK in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters STOP 
START some of these mothers apparently feeling a desperate urgency made on the spur of the moment commitments in love and sex that would have UNK consequences STOP 
START others displayed utter UNK and indifference to any decision about the past or the future STOP 
START for many of these unwed mothers the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic UNK of their parents in particular and of the world in general STOP 
START however as UNK has noted the individual's failure to develop preliminary UNK during infancy and childhood need not be UNK UNK with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his or her adolescence STOP 
START and as shown in chapter 6 some UNK females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence through the aid of and their identification with UNK STOP 
START in the specific case of time diffusion we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of UNK when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most if not all UNK in our society and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust STOP 
START the adolescent experiences two closely related crises UNK vs. an identity consciousness UNK vs. negative identity STOP 
START a sense of UNK and the freedom to experiment with different roles or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to UNK conformity is more easily developed during adolescence if during early childhood the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy STOP 
START however if the child has been constantly surrounded during nursery and early school age by UNK groups with the UNK of group acceptance and group standards allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns then in adolescence her normal degree of UNK sensitivity and UNK with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable will be compounded STOP 
START her UNK indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except UNK friends during adolescence are the UNK in her adolescence of her having been UNK in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to and judged by the performance of her UNK and UNK UNK friends STOP 
START to be different is to invite shame and doubt it is better to be UNK and criticized by one's parents who already consider one different and difficult to understand than by one's UNK who are also UNK a similar UNK for and denial of adult status STOP 
START the attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 revealed both considerable UNK with being accepted by others and a marked absence of UNK STOP 
START many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a UNK means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be UNK with more UNK and stable identification of and with one's self STOP 
START another identity crisis UNK the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. UNK STOP 
START the UNK capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the UNK necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy initiative and UNK during childhood STOP 
START the UNK process involves the individual's UNK UNK a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks having kept commitments and having created something however small or simple even a UNK dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought to be STOP 
START these childhood experiences are sources of the UNK that the adolescent needs for UNK with many roles and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of UNK and UNK her skills and abilities STOP 
START if she has not had such experiences the UNK normal adolescent degree of UNK will be compounded STOP 
START she may well be UNK by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives e.g. whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a UNK to stay UNK dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school to pursue a college education or a job after high school whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study STOP 
START UNK has noted that as this UNK UNK it may result in a UNK of UNK STOP 
START this UNK may be expressed in the UNK starting and never completing many jobs tasks and courses of study in the fact that she bases her decisions about work college UNK and studies on what others are doing rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills abilities likes and UNK STOP 
START the absence during her childhood and early adolescence of experiences in developing the UNK to complete tasks within her ability experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression both tend in her adolescence to UNK her of the UNK to UNK and to fail occasionally in UNK STOP 
START the comments made by some unwed mothers quoted in chapter 2 reflect this UNK of UNK STOP 
START they attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made accepted a job primarily because it was available convenient and paid reasonably STOP 
START these things both express and at the same time continue contributing to their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and UNK STOP 
START as their identity diffusion increased they became more UNK to UNK UNK in love and sexual affairs STOP 
START these affairs temporarily relieved the UNK of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of UNK no sense of dignity derived from a job well done STOP 
START childhood experiences in learning work and UNK habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of UNK STOP 
START the UNK from case histories presented above confirm this significance though through different UNK of experience STOP 
START for example some unwed mothers had had no work experiences household chores and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and UNK STOP 
START sex was both STOP 
START on the other hand some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative that their work and responsibilities became dull and UNK UNK to be escaped and UNK against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior STOP 
START the adolescent also faces the identity crisis that UNK has termed ideological UNK vs. diffusion of ideals STOP 
START in discussing the ways this crisis is UNK to UNK for the prevention of UNK we shall again UNK UNK concept on our data STOP 
START UNK have a UNK tendency to UNK ideas and values to perceive things as UNK black or white UNK of meaning are relatively UNK STOP 
START this tendency is perhaps most clearly revealed in the literature on religious UNK and experiences of UNK STOP 
START UNK has UNK that such ideological UNK temporarily UNK their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and UNK UNK between childhood and UNK STOP 
START it provides identification with an idea a value a cause that cuts through or even UNK the multiple and UNK UNK of their passage from child to adult and permits their UNK and overt expression of emotion STOP 
START the positive development during adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence and to identify UNK either with or against given ideas values and practices depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy initiative and UNK STOP 
START most UNK have some ideological diffusion at various UNK stages as they experience a UNK of ideas and values STOP 
START the diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed however in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing UNK STOP 
START a pronounced ideological diffusion i.e. inability to identify independently with given ideas and value systems is reflected in many ways STOP 
START for example it is UNK by the adolescent or adult whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others rather than his inner conviction and choice STOP 
START it is UNK by the individual willie UNK whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and UNK that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment STOP 
START in another sense it is represented in the arguments of the true UNK who seek to UNK the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs STOP 
START the case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion UNK in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern and her subsequent UNK to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior STOP 
START for example the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more UNK what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly STOP 
START they were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of UNK sexual UNK STOP 
START they condemned the movie script writers for UNK that sex was UNK and UNK STOP 
START they criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong they UNK parents who never disciplined and were too UNK or who never explained how easy it was to get UNK STOP 
START in the adult world there are a number of rather general and UNK sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the UNK search for meaning during this particular identity crisis STOP 
START for example some contemporary writing tends to UNK the good guys and the bad guys to UNK the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue and to explain or even justify UNK behavior by UNK it to UNK psychological UNK and social experiences STOP

START was it love had no doubt that it was STOP 
START during the rest of the summer my UNK UNK for making plaster UNK and UNK UNK of UNK flowers and leaves was all but UNK by the constantly renewed impressions of jessica that my mind served up to me for UNK and delight STOP 
START nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound UNK than the UNK of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the UNK of ties with the six or ten people i had grown most to love in the world STOP 
START in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across the river from new york i would nearly cry STOP 
START my UNK UNK arms would seem UNK inadequate UNK STOP 
START but that year was different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had UNK upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall jessica and i about to be separated not by a mere UNK or UNK kitchen but by the immense UNK of UNK in UNK distant UNK had agreed to UNK STOP 
START these letters became the center of my existence STOP 
START i lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to UNK her letter for the UNK time and finally prepare an answer STOP 
START my memory has UNK for easy reference and UNK the image of her pink UNK UNK and the UNK almost printed UNK of her neat UNK UNK with which she invited me to recall our summer so many sentences beginning with remember when and others concerning camp friends who UNK in her suburban neighborhood and news of her UNK again her piano lessons her private school a visit to boston to see her UNK and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on UNK wounded from the war in europe STOP 
START in my letters i took on a personality that differed from the self i knew in real life STOP 
START then UNK me was a foreign correspondent UNK exciting UNK and UNK full of dash and wit and UNK UNK from the books i read UNK the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special UNK class i was UNK STOP 
START the letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which i was transformed into a young man not unlike my UNK UNK UNK he of the porch steps UNK who UNK cigarettes performed the UNK wore fifty dollar suits and UNK off into the dark with girls to do UNK things with them STOP 
START like UNK in my UNK i had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely continental i would lead jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome UNK of my newest UNK would guide her gently to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented by our almost UNK one another to death with deep moist UNK burning with love STOP 
START the night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle it must have been late in september i had a vision of myself returned in UNK uniform from the front nearly dying my head UNK and UNK and jessica UNK over me the power of her love bringing me back to life STOP 
START for many nights afterward the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie awake in shame UNK with UNK UNK to fall into a deep sleep STOP 
START the weeks went by and the longer our separation grew the more UNK and almost UNK my UNK became STOP 
START they caused my love for jessica to become UNK and at the same time more hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only UNK would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again STOP 
START as it turned out jessica took matters into her own hands STOP 
START having received permission to give a camp UNK party she asked that i come and be her date STOP 
START i went and UNK and nervous all but made a fool of myself STOP 
START again among those UNK UNK UNK i was shy with UNK and acted as i had during those early saturday UNK when we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and UNK with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance STOP 
START i remember standing in a corner watching jessica act the UNK serving soft drinks to her guests STOP 
START she was wearing her dark hair in two thick UNK to attain an american girl effect she thought was appropriate to UNK STOP 
START it made her look sweet and UNK i was excited to be with her but i did not know how to express it STOP 
START yet a moment did come that night when the UNK letter writer and UNK seemed to stride off my UNK pages out of my mind and plant himself in reality STOP 
START it was late we were playing UNK games and jessica and i were called on to kiss in front of the others STOP 
START we UNK and were UNK and it turned out to be the UNK brush of lips upon cheek STOP 
START the kiss UNK our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting UNK of UNK all the mysterious UNK that i had imagined a truly UNK kiss would convey to me STOP 
START it was at that party that finally UNK my UNK inspired by tales only UNK and UNK among older boys i asked UNK to spend new year's eve with me STOP 
START UNK she accepted and so great was my emotion that all i could think of saying was you're amazing you know we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night STOP 
START we would write to one another and make a definite plan STOP 
START she was terribly pleased STOP 
START among my school and neighborhood friends during the next months i UNK and UNK and UNK described my UNK date STOP 
START but though i UNK and gave off a UNK front i was beneath it all frightened STOP 
START it would be the first time i had ever been completely alone with a girl i loved STOP 
START i had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl or how one behaved should i hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street i bring along a UNK or send one to her it UNK to meet her at home or in the city i UNK her to the door of her home or should i ask to be invited in or out should i kiss her UNK this was unknown to me and yet i had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year in one letter jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on new year's eve i knew for a moment an immense relief the letter went on she had cried she had UNK she had been miserable at his refusal and finally he had UNK and now how happy she was how UNK optimism gave me heart STOP 
START i forced confidence into myself STOP 
START i made inquiries i read a book of UNK STOP 
START in december i wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the hotel UNK a UNK spot that i had learned was the most sophisticated STOP 
START we would attend a film and later on i stated we might go to the UNK coffee shop or child's or UNK for UNK STOP 
START i set the hour of our meeting for seven STOP 
START at five o'clock that night it was already dark and behind my closed door i was dressing as carefully as a UNK STOP 
START i wore a new UNK brown UNK suit with a faint UNK design and wide UNK like a UNK ears STOP 
START my UNK leather UNK UNK with twisted raised UNK around the edges i UNK with money i had been saving STOP 
START UNK in an UNK of rough blue UNK i was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and i set out into the UNK still streets of brooklyn STOP 
START i felt superior to the neighborhood friends i was leaving behind felt older than my years and was full of UNK for myself as i headed into the UNK that was carrying its UNK of passengers out of that dull UNK and into the UNK UNK excitement of manhattan STOP 
START times square when i UNK to it with my fellow UNK UNK all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members was nearly UNK the UNK UNK with UNK with UNK up UNK and soldiers already UNK their girls and their UNK bottles of whiskey STOP 
START UNK UNK policemen sat UNK noble horses along the UNK to prevent the UNK from UNK out in front of the UNK traffic STOP 
START the night was cold but the crowd kept one warm STOP 
START the giant electric signs and UNK were lit up for the first time since UNK regulations had been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK for the UNK tin models were being UNK and bought at UNK stands every few yards along broadway and one's ears were continually UNK by the UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START an old gentlemen next to me held a boy UNK UNK to his lips and UNK away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out v for victory neighbors UNK him on STOP 
START there was a great sense of UNK STOP 
START how did one join them were they all walking to i supposed to buy a funny hat and a UNK for jessica was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other UNK who had established the UNK steps as the UNK from which to UNK their night of UNK STOP 
START i looked over their faces and felt a UNK they all looked so much more knowing than i STOP 
START i looked away STOP 
START i looked for jessica to UNK out of the UNK UNK crowd and as the time passed and i waited a UNK came to life beside me and whispered in my ear how was i planning to UNK jessica exactly would we go after the movie the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn't get in i hadn't brought along enough money felt for my UNK STOP 
START its thick substantial outline UNK me STOP 
START but when i saw that it was already ten past seven i began to wonder if something had gone wrong STOP 
START suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to UNK the plans grew uneasy STOP 
START all about me there was a UNK UNK of meetings taking place like abrupt UNK scenes in old silent movies UNK UNK and UNK UNK and UNK enthusiastic UNK into the UNK night STOP 
START whole UNK were taking up new positions on the steps arriving and UNK while i stayed glued like a UNK to one spot STOP 
START at UNK two hotel UNK came UNK down the steps carrying a UNK to be set up as a UNK in front of the UNK store window next to the UNK and as i watched them in their UNK red UNK that nearly UNK the ground their golden UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK i suddenly saw just over their shoulders jessica UNK making her way through the crowd STOP 
START my heart almost stopped beating STOP

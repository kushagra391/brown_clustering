START sentiment STOP 
START UNK management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling STOP 
START one of the devices for tension management is UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK of this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study STOP 
START the relative geographical isolation of the UNK population makes for a limited choice in UNK STOP 
START it would seem necessary that members of this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society STOP 
START the UNK relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation STOP 
START the UNK building homes on the same land with either set of parents and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as UNK for UNK and UNK illustrate this UNK relationship STOP 
START as UNK remarks in the internal pattern the chief reason for UNK is to communicate liking friendship and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another and corresponding negative UNK to those who stand in UNK relations STOP 
START achieving STOP 
START UNK of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today STOP 
START yet the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal UNK for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought about by the war STOP 
START prior to world war 2 there was a higher percentage of UNK marriages than after world war 2 STOP 
START norms STOP 
START -hlthe norms as elements refer to all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group actions in any social system STOP 
START the process of evaluation UNK varying positive and negative UNK or values to elements STOP 
START the elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in this population STOP 
START from the evidence it may be UNK that core core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females marginal marriages still belong in the category of UNK unions core negro marriages are UNK for core members STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START -hlthe element of UNK and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of UNK about them STOP 
START power STOP 
START -hlthere is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary influence of UNK power has been exerted on actors in the system particularly in regard to mate selection STOP 
START this would seem to vary from family to family depending somewhat on the core or marginal status of that family STOP 
START again size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK with members of the UNK population were attempted in order to discover the UNK of the various families in the population STOP 
START the large majority of the UNK placed core families in the upper positions STOP 
START UNK considers UNK a product of the evaluation process STOP 
START the standing or rank of an actor in a given social system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in accordance with the norms and standards of the system STOP 
START despite the increasing rate of UNK marriages the population has been able to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of its intermediate status in society STOP 
START to some extent the system can be considered a UNK in which UNK UNK are determined by birth by attributes such as sex or UNK which are UNK or socially UNK STOP 
START the UNK of many in the population to the indian background in their UNK and emphasis upon the fact that their UNK had never been slaves becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the UNK of the intermediate status of the group in society STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START -hlthe negative UNK applied to core negro marriages for core members act as UNK of expected UNK to group norms STOP 
START however because of church laws lately more UNK enforced which UNK the marriage of UNK closely related UNK a means of UNK the goal of UNK relations may be that of UNK to UNK unions STOP 
START a UNK survey of available material indicates a high rate of UNK UNK occurring to parents who have a close UNK relationship STOP 
START UNK the comprehensive or master processes UNK all or some of the elements within the social system and UNK STOP 
START within the larger social system are the structural and functional UNK STOP 
START the structural UNK consisting of relatively stable UNK among its parts includes 1 STOP 
START UNK of various types UNK by UNK norms STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK of various types within the larger system and within the UNK 3 STOP 
START UNK norms governing UNK and roles STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK values STOP 
START in the study of marriage patterns for this group UNK produces the structural system a system of UNK which in turn maintains the system of UNK STOP 
START UNK of various types have been found within this system STOP 
START each family line can be considered a UNK STOP 
START there seems to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status within the group STOP 
START UNK the UNK of core negro marriages for core families discussed above would seem to act as a UNK UNK governing UNK and roles STOP 
START the scope of this study does not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the UNK STOP 
START however it cannot be presumed informal though the structure of the population seems that there are not UNK roles within the system STOP 
START the present study UNK to the theory of functional systems STOP 
START it is UNK that UNK is a function of the social system when the population as a whole is considered and a function of the UNK when the UNK division of core families and marginal families is considered STOP 
START the four functional problems of a social system are to some extent solved by the UNK within this population STOP 
START by means of geographical isolation and high UNK rates UNK can be UNK and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained STOP 
START in order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high UNK rate provides more group members for mate selection and the UNK of members in groups UNK acceptance of group controls STOP 
START to maintain their intermediate position in the larger society it is not only necessary that members of this population be visible but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate distinct UNK or system in society STOP 
START as mentioned above where families are concentrated in larger numbers group controls seem strongest and most effective STOP 
START UNK to the social and UNK environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational UNK STOP 
START this provides the necessary contact with the larger society while supporting a type of control over members in terms of social contacts STOP 
START integration has to do with the UNK of parts STOP 
START the problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values STOP 
START the values placed by the UNK population upon maintaining a certain UNK a certain separate racial identity and therefore a certain separate social status are important for the morale of the system STOP 
START since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration the higher the morale and solidarity the better the system can solve the problems of the system STOP 
START in this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the UNK population and the white and negro UNK within the same general UNK the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the UNK population STOP 
START it is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation STOP 
START in turn higher UNK rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the population allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity STOP 
START the population can thereby UNK itself and actually grow larger STOP 
START master processes of particular utility in the analysis of the development UNK and change of social systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes STOP 
START UNK considers six such processes in his UNK STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START communication 2 STOP 
START boundary maintenance 3 STOP 
START UNK UNK 4 STOP 
START UNK 5 STOP 
START social control 6 STOP 
START UNK though undoubtedly all six processes are UNK within the whole social system and its UNK two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be UNK out for particular emphasis STOP 
START communication STOP 
START -hlin discussing the process of communication UNK UNK it as the process by which information decisions and UNK are UNK among actors and the ways in which knowledge opinions and attitudes are formed or modified by interaction STOP 
START communication may be UNK by means of the high UNK within the larger community STOP 
START intense interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational UNK mark off a group from the rest of the community as in the case of this population STOP 
START however the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation STOP 
START although the UNK population is still UNK rural there are indications of a consistent and a UNK significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities STOP 
START UNK appears to be an important factor in the UNK of this group STOP 
START this conclusion is however an UNK STOP 
START a more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that UNK people in the UNK area are in general less segregated locally than group members in rural areas STOP 
START in the urban area in other words they unlike some urban ethnic groups do not concentrate in ghetto UNK STOP 
START group pressures toward conformity are slight or UNK and UNK behavior in mate selection UNK few if any social UNK STOP 
START in such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be UNK resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily in mate selection behavior STOP 
START to the extent that urban life UNK to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential isolation to that extent it UNK directly to increased UNK STOP 
START social control STOP 
START -hlthe process of social control is UNK UNK as UNK play a part in the individual's behavior as well as the UNK behavior STOP 
START by means of this social control UNK is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group STOP 
START examples from this population indicate that UNK seems to be UNK by UNK from the group STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START -hlthere is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society STOP 
START confused and divided though this tradition may be it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and acts as a means of UNK particularly for members of the rural community STOP 
START the fact of indian UNK and free status during the days of slavery are important distinctions made by members of the group STOP 
START boundary maintenance STOP 
START UNK UNK induced social UNK resulting from common norms and values UNK by members of the group is UNK in the boundary maintenance of the group as well as in the process of UNK STOP 
START the process of boundary maintenance UNK and preserves the social system or UNK and the characteristic interaction is maintained STOP 
START as the threat of UNK on the system increases the probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases STOP 
START the UNK rate pattern would seem to be a function though a UNK one of the process of maintaining the boundary STOP 
START increased boundary maintenance may be achieved for example by UNK a higher UNK or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern STOP 
START the external pattern or external system can be considered as group behavior that UNK the group to survive in its environment STOP 
START boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social as is the UNK for UNK STOP 
START it is also expressed in the UNK against UNK in the matter of UNK particularly in rural areas STOP 
START by their pattern of UNK and UNK the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the UNK contact they maintain STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group UNK UNK is defined as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems is UNK in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit STOP

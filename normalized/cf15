START in UNK n.y. in 1952 a roman catholic hospital presented seven protestant UNK with an UNK to quit the planned UNK federation or to UNK from the hospital staff STOP 
START three agreed but four declined and were suspended STOP 
START after a flood of protests they were UNK at the beginning of 1953 STOP 
START the peace of the community was badly disturbed and people across the nation reading of the incident felt uneasy STOP 
START in new york city in 1958 the city's commissioner of hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a UNK device STOP 
START he thereby UNK a bitter controversy involving protestants jews and roman catholics that continued for two months until the city's board of hospitals lifted the UNK on UNK therapy STOP 
START a year later in albany n.y. a roman catholic hospital UNK an UNK surgeon because of his connection with the planned UNK association STOP 
START immediately the religious groups of the city were UNK in an angry dispute over the UNK invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience STOP 
START these incidents typical of many others UNK the UNK fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension UNK and UNK among religious groups in this country than the UNK issue STOP 
START it has UNK up UNK on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over UNK regulations in municipal hospitals and health and UNK agencies STOP 
START it has UNK on the national level in the matter of including UNK information and material in foreign aid to UNK countries STOP 
START where it is not actually UNK it UNK and UNK in UNK resentment like a UNK ready to UNK at any moment STOP 
START the time has come for citizens of all UNK to UNK in an effort to remove this UNK and UNK issue from the political and social life of our nation STOP 
START the first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the UNK level STOP 
START instead of emotional UNK loaded phrases and UNK we need a UNK study of the facts a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached STOP 
START all too frequently points out james UNK UNK editor of UNK catholics run UNK over protestant UNK in this matter by failure to consider the reasoning behind the protestant position and particularly by their UNK at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades STOP 
START all too often our language is UNK harsh STOP 
START the second step is to recognize the substantial agreement frequently UNK by UNK and UNK newspaper reporting already existing between catholics and UNK concerning the over-all objectives of family planning STOP 
START instead of UNK being obliged or even encouraged to UNK the greatest possible number of UNK as many UNK imagine the ideal of responsible UNK is stressed STOP 
START family planning is encouraged so that parents will be able to provide properly for their UNK STOP 
START pope UNK 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be UNK from the normal obligation of UNK for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life if there are serious reasons such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical UNK economic and social indications STOP 
START this means that such factors as the health of the parents particularly the mother their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may UNK be taken into consideration in determining the number of UNK STOP 
START these are substantially the same factors considered by UNK in family planning STOP 
START the laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons STOP 
START the roman catholic church however UNK a much more liberal policy on family planning STOP 
START catholics protestants and jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning but UNK over the methods to be used STOP 
START the roman catholic church UNK only UNK or the rhythm method also known as the use of the UNK or safe period STOP 
START the church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine author it involves no frustration of UNK laws but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them STOP 
START with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic churches most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical UNK allowing the couple free choice STOP 
START there is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement STOP 
START the grounds for the UNK position are UNK old testament the UNK of the fathers and doctors of the early church the UNK tradition of nineteen centuries the decisions of the highest UNK authority and the natural law STOP 
START the latter plays a prominent role in roman catholic theology and is considered decisive entirely apart from UNK in determining the ethical character of UNK methods STOP 
START the roman catholic UNK tradition UNK as UNK that the primary objective purpose of the UNK act is UNK and that the UNK of the mutual love of the UNK is the secondary and subjective end STOP 
START this conclusion is based on two UNK that man by the use of his reason can UNK god's purpose in the universe and that god makes known his purpose by certain given physical arrangements STOP 
START thus man can readily UNK that the primary objective end of the UNK act is UNK the UNK of the race STOP 
START moreover man may not UNK or UNK the physical arrangements established by god who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception STOP 
START believing that god is the author of this law and of all laws of nature roman catholics believe that they are obliged to UNK those laws not UNK or UNK them STOP 
START let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between protestants and roman catholics appear to be UNK STOP 
START but people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of UNK without taking up arms against those who UNK with them STOP 
START why is it so different in regard to birth control is because each side has sought to UNK its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief or at least the practical consequences thereof upon others STOP 
START it is always a temptation for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant one to UNK through the UNK fist of the law its UNK viewpoint upon others STOP 
START both roman catholics and protestants have UNK to this temptation in the past STOP 
START consider what happened during world war 1 when the protestant churches united to push the prohibition law through congress STOP 
START many of them UNK believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is UNK evil and UNK STOP 
START with over four million american men away at war protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public STOP 
START with the return of our soldiers it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens STOP 
START the attempt to UNK that belief UNK in a UNK of UNK UNK UNK and UNK that led to a breakdown of law UNK in our history STOP 
START the so-called noble experiment came to an UNK end STOP 
START that UNK painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society STOP 
START that experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today STOP 
START up to the turn of the century UNK was condemned by all christian churches as UNK UNK and contrary to divine law STOP 
START this was generally reflected in the civil laws of christian countries STOP 
START today the roman catholic and orthodox churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction STOP 
START the various UNK conferences expressing the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual change that has taken place among protestants generally STOP 
START in 1920 the UNK conference repeated its UNK UNK of UNK and issued an UNK warning against the use of UNK means for the UNK of conception together with the grave dangers physical moral and religious thereby UNK and against the UNK which the extension of such use threaten the race STOP 
START UNK the view that the sexual union is an end in itself the conference declared we UNK UNK what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of christian marriage STOP 
START one is the primary purpose for which marriage exists namely the UNK of the race through the gift and heritage of children other is the UNK importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful UNK STOP 
START the conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of UNK STOP 
START in 1930 the UNK conference again UNK the primary purpose of marriage to be the UNK of children but conceded that in certain limited circumstances UNK might be UNK legitimate STOP 
START in 1958 the conference UNK birth control as the responsibility laid by god on parents everywhere STOP 
START many other protestant denominations preceded the UNK in such action STOP 
START in march UNK 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the federal council of churches UNK artificial methods of birth control STOP 
START as to the necessity the committee declared for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the UNK of children and consequently of control of conception there can be no question STOP 
START there is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to UNK is right STOP 
START since then many protestant denominations have made separate UNK in which they not only approved birth control but declared it at times to be a religious duty STOP 
START what determines the morality they state is not the means used but the motive in general the means excluding UNK that prove most effective are considered the most ethical STOP 
START this development is reflected in the action taken in february 1961 by the general board of the national council of churches the largest protestant organization in the aj STOP 
START the board approved and UNK the use of UNK devices as a part of christian responsibility in family planning STOP 
START it called for opposition to laws and UNK practices UNK the information or availability of UNK STOP 
START the general board declared most of the protestant churches hold UNK and UNK UNK to be UNK right when the motives are right STOP 
START the general protestant conviction is that motives rather than methods form the primary moral issue provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception STOP 
START an action once UNK condemned by all christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of protestant denominations but also deemed at certain times to be a positive religious duty STOP 
START this viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country STOP 
START repeated UNK have disclosed that most married couples are now using UNK in the practice of birth control STOP 
START for all concerned with UNK legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the american people is clear profound and UNK STOP 
START to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was UNK by the UNK prohibition experiment STOP 
START this brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief STOP 
START conscience and religion are concerned with private sin the civil law is concerned with public crimes STOP 
START only confusion failure and UNK result when the effort is made to UNK upon the civil authority the impossible task of UNK private homes to UNK the possibility of sin STOP 
START among the chief victims of such an UNK UNK would be religion itself STOP

START trevelyan's liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty STOP 
START his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of UNK UNK and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described STOP 
START the three volumes brought to the UNK a characteristic of trevelyan's prose which remained UNK through his later works a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority STOP 
START the confused UNK of guerrilla warfare such as most of UNK campaigns were was brought to life by trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books STOP 
START his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities STOP 
START military knowledge love of detail and a sure feeling for the UNK of action were the added UNK STOP 
START but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story STOP 
START trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject STOP 
START the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand where he made use of UNK papers of lord john russell and english UNK materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the UNK of UNK STOP 
START in looking back over the volumes it is possible to find errors of interpretation some of which were not so evident at the time of writing STOP 
START thus trevelyan UNK the story which UNK victor UNK as UNK to abandon the famous UNK at the insistence of general UNK STOP 
START later research has shown this part of the legend of the UNK UNK to be false STOP 
START trevelyan UNK italian nationalism with little analysis he is UNK critical of UNK and french policy and he is more than generous in UNK british policy STOP 
START but fifty years later the UNK still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the UNK of italy a position UNK UNK by the UNK at the time of publication STOP 
START trevelyan's UNK and the UNK revolution of UNK his last major volume on an italian theme was written in a minor key STOP 
START published in UNK it did not gain the popular UNK of the garibaldi volumes probably because trevelyan felt less at home with UNK the UNK lawyer than with garibaldi the UNK STOP 
START the UNK of UNK politics UNK him but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures with no UNK passages and only an occasional UNK of the part played by its leading figure STOP 
START if it is not one of his best books it can only be considered UNK when compared with his own garibaldi STOP 
START already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period STOP 
START first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill STOP 
START of the two the life of bright is UNK the better biography STOP 
START trevelyan centers too exclusively on bright is UNK UNK of the views of UNK opponents and critics and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by UNK STOP 
START yet he is right when he claims in his UNK that he drew the real features of the man his tender and UNK motives and his rugged UNK strength STOP 
START in the story of bright and the corn law UNK the UNK war the american civil war and the UNK struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow UNK for so long STOP 
START because UNK speeches were so much a part of him there are long and numerous UNK which far from making the biography UNK help to give us the feel of the man STOP 
START associated in a sense with the manchester school through his mother's family trevelyan UNK in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive STOP 
START nineteenth-century virtues however seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular STOP 
START the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all STOP 
START it is a UNK history of the tory reaction which preceded the reform bill of UNK and it uses the figure of grey to give some unity to the narrative STOP 
START the volume is a piece of passionate special pleading written with the heat and often with the wisdom it must be said of a liberal UNK the UNK of politicians from UNK to UNK STOP 
START UNK trevelyan enjoyed writing the work STOP 
START the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of UNK and UNK was he has told us UNK to his artistic sense STOP 
START and UNK UNK background was close to trevelyan's own STOP 
START but his concentration on personalities and his UNK assessment of their actions fail to convey the political UNK of a long generation UNK by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation STOP 
START some historians have found his point of view not to their taste others have complained that he makes the tory tradition appear UNK rather than intelligible while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the UNK UNK of social UNK and political activity of which at times politicians are the ignorant UNK is not a field for the exercise of his talents STOP 
START the UNK heritage which UNK all of trevelyan's interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and UNK the period STOP 
START for once his touch deserted him STOP 
START research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to a more ambitious work STOP 
START britain in the nineteenth century is a UNK designed to give the sense of continuous growth to show how economic led to social and social to political change how the political events reacted on the economic and social and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process STOP 
START the plan is UNK fulfilled for the period up to UNK STOP 
START more UNK than in the study of grey and despite his liberal UNK trevelyan UNK sketches the england of UNK revolution days UNK the stresses and UNK of the revolutionary period in rich colors and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus STOP 
START his technique is UNK UNK STOP 
START by what one reader called a series of UNK views he UNK one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth STOP 
START but after UNK the narrative tends to lose its balanced UNK quality and to become a UNK of UNK often UNK by any single thread STOP 
START economic analysis was never trevelyan's strong point and the england of the industrial transformation UNK out for economic analysis STOP 
START yet after UNK the UNK of economic and social and political affairs become UNK and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account STOP 
START finally the period after UNK receives little attention and that quite UNK STOP 
START yet britain in the nineteenth century became the UNK UNK of beginning students of history went through edition after edition and continues to be UNK up to the very present STOP 
START its success is a tribute above all to trevelyan's UNK as a literary UNK STOP 
START in UNK trevelyan traveled to the united states where he delivered the UNK lectures at harvard university STOP 
START these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england STOP 
START in short order the general history became his most popular work and has remained aside from his later social history the work most widely favored by the public STOP 
START the history of england has often been compared with UNK short history STOP 
START like green trevelyan aimed to write a history not of english UNK or english UNK but of the english people STOP 
START the result was fortunate STOP 
START the history takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than english UNK and like britain in the nineteenth century it UNK badly as it goes beyond UNK STOP 
START trevelyan's UNK into contemporary history were rarely happy ones STOP 
START but as a UNK UNK interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it is UNK STOP 
START living pictures of the early UNK country life in UNK and stuart times the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature the common law UNK development STOP 
START the strength of the history is also its weakness STOP 
START trevelyan is UNK sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples STOP 
START his nationalism was not a new characteristic but its UNK even its UNK is more obvious in a book that UNK over the long reach of english history STOP 
START and yet the elements which capture his liberal and UNK imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth remembering STOP 
START UNK and compromise social justice and civil liberty are today too often in short supply for one to be UNK critical of trevelyan's emphasis on their central place in the english tradition STOP 
START like most major works of synthesis the history of england is informed by the positive views of a UNK mind and this is surely a major work STOP 
START four years after the publication of the history of england the first volume of trevelyan's queen anne UNK appeared STOP 
START by now he had become UNK professor of modern history at cambridge and had been honored by the award of the order of merit STOP 
START his academic duties had little evident effect on his UNK pen STOP 
START UNK was followed in rapid succession by UNK and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne STOP 
START like his volume on UNK the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents in this case UNK of the history of queen UNK UNK down to UNK STOP 
START trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where UNK history of england had broken off STOP 
START in addition he believed in the dramatic unity and UNK of the period from UNK lying between the stuart and UNK UNK with a special UNK of its own STOP 
START he saw the age as one in which britain settled her free constitution and UNK her modern place in the world STOP 
START to most observers there is little doubt that he placed an artificial UNK jacket of unity upon the years of UNK UNK which in reality existed only in the pages of his history STOP 
START of the three volumes UNK is easily the best STOP 
START in four opening chapters UNK of UNK famous third chapter trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening of the eighteenth century STOP 
START his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period UNK to life STOP 
START he tends to UNK or perhaps to view UNK the brutality and the violence of the age so that there is an UNK quality in these pages which UNK over some of its sharp reality STOP 
START yet as an UNK of time past there are few such successful UNK in english historical literature STOP 
START once the scene is set trevelyan UNK UNK up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of UNK and eugene of UNK at UNK STOP 
START the account of the battle is next to his UNK of UNK campaigns trevelyan's outstanding military narrative STOP 
START the scene is UNK in sharp detail the military problems UNK explained and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident STOP 
START if only for this modest UNK of military history UNK is likely to be read and UNK long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the UNK wars STOP 
START UNK and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than UNK and much less of its dramatic unity STOP 
START yet in several chapters on scotland in the eighteenth century trevelyan UNK UNK with the UNK confusion of UNK politics against a vivid background of UNK religion customs and traditions STOP

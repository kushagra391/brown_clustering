START i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea STOP 
START she made me welcome STOP 
START her dark cool UNK were UNK than any woman's many little UNK she knew made her embrace the ultimate one the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air i UNK into a nitrogen UNK STOP 
START UNK she UNK me and drew me deeper into her STOP 
START i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under UNK feet getting UNK happier and more UNK by the second STOP 
START the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now STOP 
START only the dive itself had any meaning STOP 
START the UNK nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the UNK and UNK in the sweet water STOP 
START perhaps if i took off the UNK i could swim better love my woman better STOP 
START i UNK aloud and the UNK fell out STOP 
START while a UNK part of my mind concentrated on swimming down a clear part UNK over recent events among them my only positive act in a long time STOP 
START it was when i packed up what UNK i had and went to paris STOP 
START it was no vacation just me getting out after a UNK STOP 
START i knew it wouldn't be the same STOP 
START wild UNK never are but i hoped to UNK up a better frame of mind STOP 
START once before i had been to paris long before i married UNK STOP 
START that first time was good and it stuck with me STOP 
START i was UNK back then in the army and fog put our plane down at UNK instead of UNK STOP 
START it was a saturday evening in april with a UNK rain and i was a little high on the good taste of life STOP 
START i had a UNK of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane would be UNK all night STOP 
START in less than an hour i had gotten a hotel UNK UNK and was out on the UNK UNK in a fresh uniform STOP 
START i felt like a UNK in rome STOP 
START all the women were beautiful and the men were equal to them was UNK to my UNK eyes STOP 
START there were some sweet machines other than women an old UNK a lean UNK UNK on an american UNK a UNK a type UNK UNK and lots more STOP 
START there was the arc de UNK and the tour UNK i was no UNK but i was young and this was paris had champagne at UNK then went into a cafe called the UNK et UNK to ask the way to UNK STOP 
START i never got there STOP 
START i met claire which was better STOP 
START she was eating bread and UNK just as fast as she possibly could and washing it down with red wine STOP 
START i stared STOP 
START i didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful STOP 
START she was blonde and young and nice and round in a tight white dress STOP 
START maybe her UNK eating wasn't UNK because she was so positive about it STOP 
START when she had UNK the last of the bottle and paid her bill she came directly to my table and said handsome soldier i have UNK one hunger with food STOP 
START i feel another of terrible urgency STOP 
START is your evening free madame i said with UNK UNK because of the handsome yeah STOP 
START and so off we went to her apartment STOP 
START she was a UNK of course the poor girl STOP 
START toward the break of day i UNK philosophical and drew UNK about her way of eating bread and UNK STOP 
START now it was nine years later and it wasn't spring but winter when i returned STOP 
START i got there on a saturday evening STOP 
START i made the mistake of going to the UNK et UNK STOP 
START the place was busy but i didn't feel like a UNK STOP 
START i sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up STOP 
START i had part of a bottle of french beer called UNK UNK so help me then switched to UNK STOP 
START after a few hours life hadn't showed and i was UNK STOP 
START i went to my hotel and slept STOP 
START the next morning a little UNK made me feel better but what can you do in paris on sunday morning i drank more UNK STOP 
START all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space STOP 
START i read the UNK of UNK and the UNK of cancer STOP 
START elemental but sex STOP 
START that's what was on my mind STOP 
START i was turning over the idea of a good UNK when i UNK off STOP 
START i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up STOP 
START my head was clear my thinking sober and i was UNK to this paris idea as a UNK on top of all my others STOP 
START a good UNK has that kind of therapeutic value STOP 
START sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was UNK STOP 
START i went out into it STOP 
START i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park and i sat down on a UNK bench where the light was dim and came from the sky STOP 
START there was dignity and beauty in the little white UNK falling through the blue night STOP 
START i had on only a UNK but i wasn't cold STOP 
START i was just miserable STOP 
START pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded UNK as a walking stick STOP 
START she saw me and sat down beside me three feet away STOP 
START suddenly i understood why she had the UNK STOP 
START it gave her UNK and posture STOP 
START without it she would have been UNK and limp STOP 
START it gave her UNK STOP 
START it gave her the right to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle STOP 
START i couldn't imagine her without it STOP 
START i knew all about her STOP 
START she was another human being and happened to be a UNK STOP 
START i didn't much care if she were there or not STOP 
START after a while she said with sort of an UNK laugh you have snow in your hair and ears STOP 
START i didn't have on a hat STOP 
START hardly UNK at her i smiled a UNK one which said thanks baby but i'd rather be alone STOP 
START she was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy i'm not unhappy i UNK staring at the snow STOP 
START she was trying to make a hole in my UNK and i didn't want it STOP 
START is it a woman asked gently STOP 
START she must have seen the ring on my left hand STOP 
START well women and UNK go together i observed UNK adding you can UNK your UNK on that STOP 
START ah monsieur it is not my business to UNK it STOP 
START this took me so funny i had to look at her STOP 
START i felt my frozen sad face UNK and i grinned a silly one i couldn't have helped STOP 
START i even UNK a UNK STOP 
START she smiled at me but it was an UNK sad smile STOP 
START she was even more miserable than me STOP 
START her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was UNK and infinite wisdom in them STOP 
START now isn't it better to smile asked STOP 
START because i liked this sad person so much i said will you have a drink with me could see the ancient UNK UNK itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same UNK STOP 
START anyway i pulled a bottle of UNK martin out of my UNK drew the UNK and passed it to her STOP 
START i could see she was shocked STOP 
START i'm sorry i haven't got a glass i said STOP 
START UNK UNK she said taking the bottle not for that be sorry STOP 
START she tilted up and drank and then i drank STOP 
START it's really UNK to drink good UNK like that but i hadn't cared before STOP 
START i wasn't going to UNK around a glass STOP 
START there wasn't much light in the blue dark but i could see her well STOP 
START no child this UNK she must have been thirty-five or even forty STOP 
START i couldn't be sure STOP 
START somehow she was attractive STOP 
START not good looking but UNK and wise so that it made her attractive STOP 
START i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there STOP 
START we finished the bottle i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier not speaking much to each other and we stayed sober STOP 
START i suppose we were cold but we didn't feel it STOP 
START we seemed to be UNK sadly UNK in the cold cold air while the snow fell STOP 
START then she said UNK and we got up and went to my hotel without another word STOP 
START i sensed no stranger in her STOP 
START we UNK and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with UNK STOP 
START i decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age STOP 
START she had a funny little UNK on her stomach on the left side STOP 
START i think we were very tired for we UNK at the same moment deeply rested surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the UNK had UNK STOP 
START i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last night's UNK STOP 
START my head was clear STOP 
START i was hungry as a UNK and my body felt lean and vital STOP 
START UNK UNK i said UNK sitting up which pulled the covers to her UNK STOP 
START she looked good with her short UNK hair and no UNK STOP 
START maybe closer to thirty i thought STOP 
START UNK UNK exclaimed smiling STOP 
START UNK UNK yeah but breakfast first STOP 
START with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom STOP 
START i called downstairs for food and a UNK for her STOP 
START she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my UNK STOP 
START i had brushed my teeth UNK UNK and dressed by the time a UNK UNK in breakfast STOP 
START the UNK monsieur he said UNK it STOP 
START i gave it to the woman STOP 
START what is this for asked UNK STOP 
START why to brush your teeth STOP 
START but i already have used yours STOP 
START oh said with round eyes STOP 
START i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself STOP 
START but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell live UNK i decided i would UNK my worries away STOP 
START the coffee wasn't very hot though made in a UNK pot but it was good STOP 
START we sent the UNK away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot UNK eggs and hot UNK bread STOP 
START as we ate we talked STOP 
START her name was UNK and mine stephen STOP 
START we sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee STOP 
START you are very UNK do you know stephen she remarked STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START yes because you didn't run off to use that new UNK STOP 
START i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror STOP 
START i didn't really use yours she went on STOP 
START i carry one in my purse STOP 
START i know men never kiss UNK UNK STOP 
START to my immense relief she changed the subject in the next sentence shall we go to the UNK today all right STOP 
START i said with enthusiasm at the idea STOP 
START but not immediately STOP 
START i put aside my empty cup STOP 
START she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and UNK her own STOP 
START we were not rushed STOP 
START what is this from asked touching the UNK on her stomach STOP 
START it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle STOP 
START a bullet she answered STOP 
START the UNK was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all STOP 
START she understood sex anyway and played at it well STOP 
START we went to the UNK for a few hours then by UNK to a UNK in UNK STOP 
START it was a nice place not filled with smoke STOP 
START we had champagne and UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK brought the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered STOP 
START he must have thought i was a tourist STOP 
START i fixed him with a UNK eye and said what's this for didn't ask for a UNK of champagne STOP 
START i thought that was pretty humorous but i didn't laugh STOP

START rather than being UNK the eye is puzzled of seeing objects in space it sees nothing more than a picture STOP 
START through UNK and 1912 as the UNK UNK tendency to UNK to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task of keeping the surface at UNK length fell all the more to UNK UNK STOP 
START to UNK and sometimes to replace the UNK UNK UNK and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint UNK texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas STOP 
START in certain other pictures however UNK began to paint areas in exact UNK of wood UNK or UNK STOP 
START these areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the UNK printing into a depth from which it could be UNK and set to UNK again only by conventional perspective is by being placed in such relation to the forms UNK within the illusion that these forms left no room for the UNK except near the surface STOP 
START the accumulation of such devices however soon had the effect of UNK even while UNK surface and depth STOP 
START the process of UNK seemed UNK and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from UNK with the illusion STOP 
START it was for this reason and no other that i can see that in september 1912 UNK took the radical and revolutionary step of UNK actual pieces of UNK UNK to a drawing on paper instead of trying to UNK its texture in paint STOP 
START picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of UNK when he glued a piece of UNK UNK to a painting on canvas STOP 
START it is true that his first collage looks more UNK than UNK which would confirm the date he UNK it STOP 
START but it is also true that UNK was the consistent pioneer in the use of UNK UNK as well as of UNK moreover he had already begun to UNK and UNK the UNK of UNK cubism as far back as the end of 1910 STOP 
START when we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each STOP 
START it makes no real difference that UNK collage is on paper and UNK out in charcoal while UNK is on canvas and UNK out in oil STOP 
START by its greater UNK presence and its greater UNK the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the UNK printing or UNK UNK had ever done STOP 
START but here again the UNK device both UNK and falls short of its aim STOP 
START for the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in UNK which gives way in turn and with equal UNK to an illusion that seems to contain both or neither STOP 
START because of the size of the areas it covers the UNK paper UNK UNK UNK UNK as more than an indication or sign STOP 
START literal UNK now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device UNK the illusion of depth is rendered even more UNK than before STOP 
START instead of UNK the literal UNK by UNK and UNK it the UNK paper or cloth UNK and UNK it and the artist seems to have nothing left but this UNK UNK with which to finish as well as start his picture STOP 
START the actual surface becomes both ground and background and it turns out suddenly and paradoxically that the only place left for a UNK illusion is in front of upon the surface STOP 
START in their very first UNK UNK and picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as UNK seem to thrust out into real UNK space or to be about to do so while the rest of the subject remains UNK in or flat upon the surface STOP 
START and the surface is driven back in its very UNK only by this contrast STOP 
START in the upper center of UNK first collage fruit dish in douglas UNK collection a bunch of UNK is rendered with such UNK vivid UNK effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane STOP 
START the UNK illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel UNK but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it STOP 
START yet the violent UNK of the UNK strips UNK to the paper and the only lesser UNK of block UNK that UNK window UNK manage somehow to push the UNK cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not jump STOP 
START at the same time the UNK strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and UNK of UNK UNK upon them and by their placing in relation to the block UNK these UNK seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing and by contrast with the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the UNK and ambiguous one that each has with the surface STOP 
START and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents of UNK first collage STOP 
START in later UNK of both masters a variety of UNK materials are used sometimes in the same work and almost always in conjunction with every other UNK and UNK device they can think of STOP 
START the area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material or simply of a UNK form will be UNK to UNK that edge away from the surface while something will be drawn painted or even UNK over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth STOP 
START planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is suggested UNK which is greater than that established UNK STOP 
START all this UNK the UNK between surface and depth so as to UNK UNK space in front of the surface as well as behind it STOP 
START UNK may now UNK everything but it is a UNK become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself at least an optical if not properly speaking a UNK illusion STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK is now almost completely UNK to the literal UNK kind but at the same time it UNK upon and largely UNK the UNK kind and it does so moreover without UNK the latter of its UNK it UNK and UNK that UNK UNK it STOP 
START out of this UNK UNK the UNK subject UNK STOP 
START for it had turned out by a further UNK of cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and UNK had now become widely UNK from the means of representation or UNK STOP 
START in the UNK phase of their cubism UNK and picasso had not only had to minimize UNK simply in order to preserve it had also had to UNK it to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief became UNK from specific UNK entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such as a UNK UNK and UNK property detached from everything not itself STOP 
START in order to be saved UNK had had to be isolated as the aspect of the subject was UNK into those UNK of more or less UNK and UNK UNK by which UNK was isolated under the UNK method the subject itself became largely UNK STOP 
START cubism in its UNK phase which the french with justice call UNK was on the UNK of abstract art STOP 
START it was then that picasso and UNK were confronted with a unique dilemma they had to choose between illusion and representation STOP 
START if they UNK for illusion it could only be illusion per UNK an illusion of depth and of relief so general and UNK as to UNK the representation of individual objects STOP 
START if on the other hand they UNK for representation it had to be representation per UNK representation as image pure and simple without UNK at least without more than UNK ones of the UNK space in which the objects represented originally existed STOP 
START it was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear the UNK could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become for the first time mutually exclusive alternatives STOP 
START in the end picasso and UNK UNK for the UNK and it would seem they did so deliberately STOP 
START this provides whatever real justification there is for the talk about reality STOP 
START but the inner formal logic of cubism as it worked itself out through the collage had just as much to do with UNK their decision STOP 
START when the smaller UNK of UNK cubism were placed upon or UNK with the large UNK shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage they had to UNK become UNK into larger UNK shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the UNK of the picture plane STOP 
START left in their previous UNK UNK they would have cut away too abruptly into depth the broad UNK shapes of UNK paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane STOP 
START large planes UNK with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat they also assert themselves as UNK independent UNK are apt to coincide with the UNK contours of the subject from which a picture starts if it does start from a subject STOP 
START it was because of this UNK as much as for any other reason that is because of the growing independence of the UNK unit in collage as a shape that the identity of UNK objects or at least parts of them UNK in UNK and UNK UNK UNK and continued to remain more UNK there but only as UNK UNK than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913 STOP 
START UNK cubism came to an end in the collage but not UNK did synthetic cubism fully begin there STOP 
START only when the collage had been UNK translated into oil and transformed by this translation did cubism become an affair of positive color and flat UNK UNK whose UNK and placement created UNK to if not the illusion of UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START synthetic cubism began with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in UNK was the point at which he finally took the lead in UNK UNK away from UNK never again to UNK it STOP 
START but even before that picasso had UNK and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him STOP 
START it was as though in that instant he had felt the UNK of collage as too UNK and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back or forward to literal UNK STOP 
START this he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage and of cubism in general literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane STOP 
START some time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four UNK strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and UNK space to which there clung only the UNK of a picture plane STOP 
START the affixed elements of collage were UNK as it were and cut off from the literal UNK surface to form a UNK STOP

START there is a pause in the UNK as your friends gaze at you wondering why you are staring UNK in UNK STOP 
START you explain i have the UNK feeling of having lived through this very same event before STOP 
START i can't tell when but i'm positive i witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past experience will have happened to many of you STOP 
START UNK in his lecture refers to the startling experience which almost every person UNK in daylight that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before whether dreaming or waking a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room and heard precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when STOP 
START most UNK UNK these instances of that UNK feeling as the UNK UNK already seen illusion just as they UNK dream UNK as UNK STOP 
START in this manner they UNK the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us UNK continually STOP 
START when a man UNK a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance of UNK UNK except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar STOP 
START occasionally there are examples of UNK which cannot be pushed aside without UNK an UNK attitude STOP 
START one day UNK coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream detailed the UNK UNK in advance so accurately that his companion was completely UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK for the UNK of UNK research was altered somewhat when he wondered how or why had i been shown an UNK roll of my life film famous author tells us of the strange incident in something about myself STOP 
START one day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in westminster UNK his view was UNK by a UNK man on his left his attention turned to the UNK pattern of the rough UNK UNK and someone UNK him by the arm whispered i want a word with you please STOP 
START at that moment UNK was UNK with UNK UNK suddenly UNK that these identical details of scene action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier STOP 
START UNK probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams enabling us to recognize their UNK in our UNK thoughts STOP 
START however readers who accept UNK findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams should UNK over the following words in his interpretation of dreams chapter 1 a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case and what is more every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the UNK or UNK power of dreams STOP 
START dreams present many UNK of UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the basic mystery of dreams which UNK all the others and UNK us from even the most common typical dream is in the fact that they are original visual UNK STOP 
START i recall the startling vivid realism of a dream in which i lived through the horror of the UNK of a little korean town STOP 
START i am sure that nothing within me is capable of UNK that UNK sequence so complete in detail from the UNK of news pictures i have seen STOP 
START and when psychology explains UNK but the UNK mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as UNK as part of the individual mind STOP 
START UNK may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is UNK UNK of routine evidence STOP 
START the question becomes what is a dream a dream simply a mental or UNK movie dream and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of UNK thought is a UNK phenomenon for which no explanation is available STOP 
START in most cases we recognize certain words persons animals or objects STOP 
START but these are dreamed in original action in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life STOP 
START for instance the UNK sees himself seated behind neighbor smith and with photographic realism sees smith driving the car it is a matter of fact that smith cannot drive a car STOP 
START there is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original realistic and UNK continuity like we experience in dreams STOP 
START the entire concept of UNK UNK as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support STOP 
START a mental image UNK UNK us from beneath its language symbols in UNK thought or consciously in light sleep is actually not an image at all but is UNK of realities viewed not in the UNK UNK stream but within the depths of the fourth dimension STOP 
START dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components including that UNK feeling of UNK UNK inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem STOP 
START as in the theory of perception established in UNK the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain STOP 
START but then this theory UNK that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain STOP 
START the opening paragraph of the chapter titled the theory of representative perception in the book UNK of science by albert g. UNK says passed on to the brain and there by some UNK process it causes the mind to have a perception STOP 
START but why is it necessary to UNK the UNK image within the brain UNK images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves between the inner brain and the eyes carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers rather than to UNK on the transmission of an image which is already in required location STOP 
START UNK the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen not the UNK image the purpose of which would be to achieve UNK cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other UNK centers motor tensions associated word symbols and consciousness STOP 
START modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy STOP 
START we know that the number of radio and television impulses sound waves UNK UNK etc. that may occupy the very same space each solitary upon its own frequency is infinite STOP 
START so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal apparently UNK states of matter successive one after another in consciousness but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies STOP 
START this theory makes it possible for any event throughout UNK to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness STOP 
START space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions STOP 
START if the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical through what medium does it extend is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent UNK past or the UNK UNK future STOP 
START three seconds flat is the usual time and the space is crossed by moderate mileage while the overwhelming UNK of such UNK must be conceived as a static UNK through an enormous number of UNK frequencies which UNK all events STOP 
START the body senses and brain in common with all matter have their UNK on each of a countless number of frequencies STOP 
START the senses in each UNK bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency whereas those upon all other frequencies are UNK UNK and UNK to them STOP 
START consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to UNK impressions STOP 
START when consciousness UNK the sleeping body and the UNK world it continues in the UNK UNK of the UNK past and future in a life as UNK and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep STOP 
START if the UNK realistic continuity of dreams however UNK their combinations UNK that it is purely a composition of the brain it must be compounded from views of diverse realities although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life STOP 
START dr. h. v. UNK professor of UNK at the university of pennsylvania dreamed that a UNK priest associated with the king UNK UNK b.c. UNK him to the UNK chamber of the temple of UNK gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken UNK and UNK an error in its identification STOP 
START as a matter of fact the UNK classification the result of many weeks of labor by dr. UNK was about to be published by him the following day STOP 
START some time later the missing part of the UNK was found and the complete UNK together with other new evidence fully UNK the ancient UNK information STOP 
START dr. UNK was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream STOP 
START he was almost positive it was not UNK nor UNK and imagined it must have been german or english STOP 
START we may conclude that all six points of information UNK given by the dream priest could have been furnished by dr. UNK UNK reasoning STOP 
START but in UNK any physical reality for this dream how could the brain possibly UNK that realistic UNK visual continuity UNK by UNK UNK violent break or sudden UNK theory is more fantastic 1 STOP 
START that the perfect continuity was composed from the UNK of memory impressions in the UNK brain or 2 STOP 
START that the dream was a reality on the infinite UNK of universal gradient frequencies across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient UNK met degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to UNK determines whether a dream will be a recognized fulfilled UNK or the vaguely effective source of the UNK UNK UNK feeling STOP 
START no doubt some experiences UNK so completely as to leave no trace on the UNK mind STOP 
START probably less than one percent of our UNK escape final UNK before we wake STOP 
START when we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority they of course cannot UNK us as anything familiar STOP 
START nevertheless there are notably frequent instances of UNK UNK in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before a feeling which though vague UNK the verbal UNK from the most impressive corps of psychologists STOP 
START if UNK UNK is an illusion then UNK it is a most UNK mental UNK UNK even the most UNK people STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK for the republican presidential nomination was attending a convention at UNK where he was scheduled to UNK colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met STOP 
START after the preliminary business affair was finished UNK arose and delivered the convincing speech that UNK the nomination for roosevelt STOP 
START if UNK had told any academic UNK that he had a UNK feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past he would have been informed that he was a victim of UNK UNK STOP 
START but the famous UNK felt more than vague recognition for the scene STOP 
START he remembered exactly when he had lived through it before and he had something to prove he had STOP 
START one week before the convention UNK was seated on the porch of a country home on the hudson UNK at the opposite shore STOP

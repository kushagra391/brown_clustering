START in a UNK assessment of the cold war UNK declared there must be much closer unity within the west before there can be effective UNK with the east STOP 
START ordinary methods of diplomacy within the free world are inadequate said the former prime minister STOP 
START something much more thorough is required STOP 
START UNK the experience of the combined UNK of staff in world war 2 UNK said that all would have been confusion and UNK without them STOP 
START this he said is exactly what has been happening between the politically free nations in the postwar world STOP 
START we need joint UNK of a political general staff STOP 
START UNK the advances of communist power in recent years sir anthony observed this very grave state of affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality of the danger that UNK them and UNK their policies and resources to meet it STOP 
START while i fully agree with sir UNK UNK i think that we must carry the analysis farther bearing in mind that while common UNK may be the measure of our need the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the measure of our capacity STOP 
START while it is UNK to project the trend of history it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully emerging in the western world particularly among the countries of western europe STOP 
START at the end of world war 2 free europe was ready for a new beginning STOP 
START the UNK of nationalism had brought down upon europe a generation of tyranny and war and a return to the old order of things seemed UNK STOP 
START under these conditions a new generation of UNK began to discover the bonds of long association and shared values that for so long had been UNK to UNK UNK STOP 
START a slow and painful trend toward UNK has taken hold a trend which may at any time be arrested and UNK but which may also lead to a binding federation of europe STOP 
START it may well be that the UNK of europe will prove inadequate that the survival of free society will require nothing less than the UNK of the entire western world STOP 
START the movement toward european unity has been expressed in two UNK UNK and UNK one looking to the constitution of a united states of europe the other building on UNK UNK of practical cooperation for the solution of specific problems STOP 
START thus far the advances made have been almost entirely along functional lines STOP 
START many factors contributed to the growth of the european movement STOP 
START in 1946 sir winston churchill who had spoken often of european union during the war UNK the formation of a kind of united states of europe STOP 
START had churchill been returned to office in 1945 it is just possible that britain instead of standing UNK UNK would have led europe toward union STOP 
START in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive coordinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation of the organization for european economic cooperation to UNK and UNK the uses of american aid under the marshall plan STOP 
START the united states might well have UNK the opportunity provided by the european recovery program to push the UNK european nations toward political federation as well as economic cooperation but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the united states government at the time STOP 
START another powerful factor in the european movement was the threat of soviet UNK STOP 
START the communist UNK in UNK in 1948 was followed immediately by the conclusion of the UNK treaty a UNK alliance among britain france and the UNK countries STOP 
START and of course the soviet threat was responsible for nato the grand alliance of the atlantic nations STOP 
START new organs of UNK UNK in the decade following the conclusion of the nato alliance STOP 
START in 1949 the council of europe came into existence a purely UNK UNK body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity STOP 
START in 1952 the european coal and steel community was launched placing the coal and steel production of france west germany italy and UNK under a UNK high authority STOP 
START for a time it appeared that a common european army might be created but the project for a european defense community was rejected by the french national assembly in 1954 STOP 
START in 1957 the UNK approach to european integration was UNK by the formation among the six of a UNK european common market and UNK for cooperation in the development of atomic energy STOP 
START the overseas UNK have generally encouraged the european UNK movement without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation in a broader atlantic community STOP 
START the united states and canada belong only to nato and the new UNK STOP 
START britain until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of the UNK at a UNK wedding STOP 
START in other areas it held back pleading its UNK bonds STOP 
START now britain has decided to seek admission to the european economic community and it seems certain that she will be joined by some of her partners in the loose free trade area of the outer seven STOP 
START besides its historical significance as a break with the UNK tradition of british UNK UNK move if successful will constitute an historic UNK of the first importance in the movement toward the UNK of europe and the western world STOP 
START if a broader atlantic community is to be formed and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both our needs and our capacity a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand in the nato alliance STOP 
START the time is now ripe indeed UNK for the vigorous development of its UNK UNK for its development as an instrument of atlantic community STOP 
START what is required is the full UNK of article 2 of the treaty which provides the parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions are founded and by promoting conditions of stability and UNK STOP 
START they will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage economic collaboration between any and all of them STOP 
START as lester pearson wrote in 1955 nato cannot live on fear alone STOP 
START it cannot become the source of a real atlantic community if it remains organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought it into being STOP 
START the problem of nato is not one of machinery of which there is an abundance but of the will to use it STOP 
START the nato council is available as an executive agency the standing group as a high military authority STOP 
START the UNK conference of UNK is available as a potential legislative authority STOP 
START this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community by fiat but only when that community UNK from UNK to reality STOP 
START the existence of a community is a state of mind a conviction that goals and values are widely shared that effective communication is possible that mutual trust is reasonably assured STOP 
START an equally promising avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the development and expansion of the UNK STOP 
START conceived as an organ of economic cooperation there is no reason why UNK cannot UNK into a broader instrument of union if its members so desire STOP 
START indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato for the development of a UNK organ of the atlantic nations because it could UNK all of the members of the atlantic community including those like UNK and switzerland who are UNK to be associated with an essentially military alliance like aj STOP 
START underlying these hopes and UNK is a conviction that the nations of the north atlantic area do indeed form a community at least a potential community STOP 
START there is nothing new in this is new and UNK is that the west is now but one of several powerful UNK or systems and that one or more of the others may pose a UNK danger to the west STOP 
START for centuries the north atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other STOP 
START that time is now past and the atlantic nations if they are to survive must develop a UNK community and they must also look beyond the UNK of western civilization toward a world-wide concert of free nations STOP 
START 6 the burden of these UNK is that a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs STOP 
START and if we do not UNK to too much it is also within our capacity STOP 
START a realistic UNK of the need for new forms of international organization on the one hand and our capacity to achieve them on the other must be approached through the concept of community STOP 
START history has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external danger UNK to be UNK urgent STOP 
START only when a concert of nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values is it likely to form a UNK instrument of long-range policy STOP 
START it follows that the solution to the current UNK of the free nations is only to a very limited extent a matter of UNK new machinery of UNK and coordination STOP 
START it is very much a matter of building the foundations of community STOP 
START it is for these reasons that proposals for a new world order through radical UNK of the united nations or through some sort of world federation are utterly UNK STOP 
START in a recent book called world peace through world law two distinguished lawyers UNK clark and louis UNK call for just such an UNK of the u.n. UNK their case on the world-wide fear of a nuclear UNK STOP 
START i believe that these proposals however UNK in terms of world needs go far beyond our capacity to realize them STOP 
START such proposals look to an UNK act a kind of UNK social contract on a world-wide scale STOP 
START the UNK of these proposals is in their attempt to UNK history and their assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible STOP 
START a working concept of the organic evolution of community must lead us in a different direction STOP 
START the UNK of the u.n. and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond what was UNK feasible STOP 
START our problem therefore is to UNK processes more modest in their aspirations adjusted to the real world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities STOP 
START the history of the u.n. UNK that in a UNK world we must develop processes of influence and UNK rather than UNK STOP 
START it is possible that international organization will ultimately UNK the UNK system but its proper function for the immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to render UNK more compatible with an UNK world STOP 
START new machinery of coordination should not be our primary objective in the UNK future though perhaps the political general staff of western leaders proposed by sir anthony UNK would serve a useful purpose STOP 
START generally however there is an abundance of available machinery of coordination in nato in UNK in the u.n. and elsewhere STOP 
START the trouble with this machinery is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence of a conscious sense of community among the free nations STOP 
START our proper objective then is the development of a new spirit the realization of a potential community STOP 
START a concert of free nations should take its UNK from the traditions of the nineteenth century concert of europe with its common values and accepted rules of the game STOP 
START UNK of and by themselves mean little history of both the league of nations and the united nations UNK that STOP 
START but a powerful sense of community even with little or no machinery means a great deal STOP 
START that is the lesson of the nineteenth century STOP 
START a realistic concert of free nations might be expected to consist of an inner community of the north atlantic nations and an outer community UNK much or all of the UNK world STOP

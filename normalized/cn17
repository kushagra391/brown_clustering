START i guided her to the UNK turned off the tv faced her STOP 
START she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes STOP 
START and what eyes they were STOP 
START big and dark a melting golden brown STOP 
START eyes like hot honey eyes that UNK STOP 
START plus UNK skin smooth UNK and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them STOP 
START it was a UNK familiar face too but i couldn't remember where we had met STOP 
START i said do we know each other miss no i remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all i could think of was this time she stopped the rush of words herself STOP 
START i'm sorry STOP 
START shall i go on smiled STOP 
START it was her first smile STOP 
START but worth waiting for STOP 
START sure STOP 
START i said STOP 
START but one word at a time UNK was still UNK the stained coat around her so i said relax let me take your things STOP 
START would you like a drink or coffee no thanks STOP 
START she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a UNK scream and i let out a UNK UNK sound like a UNK blowing out STOP 
START she was wearing nothing beneath the coat STOP 
START she jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again but not soon enough STOP 
START there had been a good second or two during which my UNK had been blowing out and now i was certain i'd seen her somewhere before STOP 
START i forgot UNK STOP 
START oh do forgive me STOP 
START i'm sorry i forgive that's what started all the trouble in the first place STOP 
START oh dear i'm all UNK STOP 
START you and me both dear STOP 
START haven't we haven't i seen you STOP 
START i mean surely we've you may have seen me on tv she said STOP 
START i've done several UNK UNK for then it hit me STOP 
START UNK cried STOP 
START why yes STOP 
START and you recognized me yes indeed STOP 
START in fact i was watching you on that little UNK screen when you rang my bell STOP 
START man you rang it was in color too miss and miss your name anyway you were splendid STOP

START splendid STOP 
START in a UNK and all that STOP 
START that's the last one we did STOP 
START that was a fun one STOP 
START i'll bet STOP 
START it was fun for me all right STOP 
START i don't mean to UNK but do they hide the UNK with the bubbles mean is advertising honest it depends on who does it STOP 
START i never wear anything at all STOP 
START it wouldn't wouldn't seem fair somehow STOP 
START i couldn't agree with you more STOP 
START i really do have something important to tell you mr. scott STOP 
START about the murder STOP 
START murder yeah i said STOP 
START tell me about the murder STOP 
START she told me STOP 
START UNK was the creation of two men louis UNK and bill UNK partners in UNK inc. STOP 
START they'd UNK the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when with the addition of UNK to their secret formula and the UNK of a UNK advertising campaign sales had UNK practically into orbit STOP 
START their product had been UNK by good UNK the UNK and the UNK journal among other UNK of higher wisdom and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john even your best friends would think you didn't UNK STOP 
START my lovely UNK joyce UNK was her name had previously done three UNK UNK for UNK and this evening the fourth a UNK production had been UNK at the home of louis UNK STOP 
START the water in UNK big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick UNK UNK UNK of course from UNK joyce had UNK from the board into the pool then UNK and UNK in her UNK bath while UNK rolled STOP 
START the finished and UNK cut product would begin with a UNK UNK of joyce entering the UNK then bursting above the UNK surface UNK in UNK of UNK UNK and i had a UNK this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap to clean men and boys STOP 
START joyce went on when we'd finished lou mr. UNK asked me to stay a little longer STOP 
START he wanted a few UNK for magazine UNK he said STOP 
START everybody left and i stayed in the pool then lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too STOP 
START and he didn't have any clothes on STOP 
START he didn't yes he didn't STOP 
START did i mean STOP 
START she paused STOP 
START did leap into the pool and didn't have anything on STOP 
START anyway it was evident what he had in mind STOP 
START you got away didn't you yes STOP 
START he caught up with me once and grabbed me but i was all covered with UNK it's very UNK you know STOP 
START i didn't know STOP 
START i wouldn't have the stuff in the house STOP 
START but i'm pleased to hear so i just UNK out of his UNK STOP 
START i UNK like mad got out of the pool grabbed my UNK and ran to the car STOP 
START the keys were still in it and i was miles away before i remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little UNK where i'd changed STOP 
START she'd driven around for a while joyce said then thinking louis UNK would have UNK down by that time she'd gone back to his home on UNK UNK drive parked in front and walked toward the pool STOP 
START while several yards from it still UNK by the UNK she'd seen two men on her left at the UNK edge STOP 
START she went on a man was holding onto lou holding him up STOP 
START maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i thought he must be dead STOP 
START the man UNK him into the water then ran past the UNK STOP 
START there's a walk there that goes out to UNK drive STOP 
START i was so scared well i just ran to my car and came here STOP 
START you know who the other man was no i never did see his face STOP 
START i didn't get a good look at him at all his back was to me and i was so scared it was just somebody in a man's suit STOP 
START but i'm sure the other one was lou STOP 
START what joyce wanted me to do was go to UNK house and do whatever detectives do and get her clothes and UNK containing her identification STOP 
START she realized i'd have to UNK the police but UNK hoped i could avoid UNK her name STOP 
START her impact in the UNK UNK had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an UNK tv series underwater western eye a UNK show to be sponsored by UNK UNK STOP 
START but if joyce got involved in murder or UNK UNK the role would probably go to the UNK wife mrs. UNK UNK STOP 
START or at least not to joyce STOP 
START and i so want the part she said STOP 
START the UNK have just been for money there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them but in underwater western eye i'd have a chance to act STOP 
START i could show what i can do STOP 
START as far as i was concerned she had already and had UNK shown what she could do STOP 
START but i promised joyce i would mention her name if at all only as a last resort STOP 
START seeming much relieved she smiled one of those UNK smiles and i smiled all the way into the bedroom STOP 
START there i got my colt special and shoulder UNK slipped my coat on and went back into the front room STOP 
START joyce UNK a little on the UNK STOP 
START i'm starting to UNK she said STOP 
START UNK yes i'm still all covered with that soap STOP 
START i was loaded with UNK when i ran away and i haven't had a chance to wash it off STOP 
START UNK it sure UNK STOP 
START you might as well wait here while i'm gone so you can use my shower if you'd like STOP 
START oh i'd love to STOP 
START i showed her the shower and tub and she said smiling if you really don't mind i think i'll get clean in the shower then UNK for a few minutes in your tub STOP 
START that always UNK me STOP 
START doesn't it you only when i do it STOP 
START i shook my head STOP 
START one of my virtues or UNK is a sort of UNK imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color STOP 
START UNK as long as you want joyce STOP 
START it'll probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with you STOP 
START so you'll have everything all to yourself UNK i looked at my watch STOP 
START ten after nine STOP 
START time to go i supposed STOP 
START well UNK i said STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START you'd better hurry STOP 
START oh you can count on that STOP 
START she smiled slightly STOP 
START softly STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START don't hurry too much STOP 
START i'll be UNK for at least half an hour STOP 
START that was all she said STOP 
START but suddenly those UNK eyes seemed to have everything but UNK of bees in them STOP 
START however when there's a job to be done i'm a UNK of grim determination i like to think STOP 
START i spun about and UNK through the front room to the door STOP 
START as i went out i could hear water UNK in the shower STOP 
START hot water STOP 
START she wouldn't be taking a cold shower STOP 
START hell she couldn't STOP 
START UNK UNK drive is only two or three miles from the UNK and it took me less than five minutes to get there STOP 
START but the scene was not the quiet calm scene i'd expected STOP 
START four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars STOP 
START lights UNK in the big house and surrounding grounds STOP 
START i followed a UNK UNK path alongside the house to the pool STOP 
START two UNK officers a couple of UNK i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left STOP 
START at the UNK far end was the little UNK joyce had mentioned and on the UNK surface UNK scattered UNK UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START a few yards beyond the group of men a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green UNK STOP 
START lieutenant UNK one of the UNK spotted me and said UNK shell and walked toward me STOP 
START UNK you hear about this one grinned but ignored the question STOP 
START he didn't push it worked out of central UNK and we'd been friends for years STOP 
START he filled me in STOP 
START a call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine p.m. and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that 10 minutes ago now STOP 
START present at the scene in addition to the dead man who was indeed louis UNK had been UNK partner bill UNK and UNK rose an advertising agency executive who handled the UNK account STOP 
START neither of them i understood had been present at the UNK session earlier STOP 
START what were they doing here asked UNK STOP 
START they were supposed to meet UNK at nine UNK for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap a new angle based on this UNK stuff STOP 
START yeah i've heard more about UNK than space exploration lately STOP 
START what is the UNK how would i know a secret STOP 
START that was the new advertising angle something about a UNK of london policy to insure the UNK of the secret UNK STOP 
START actually only two men know what the formula is UNK and he stopped and looked at UNK body STOP 
START i said UNK so now only UNK knows STOP 
START UNK it strike you UNK or fair can't say yet STOP 
START deputy UNK says it looks like he UNK in a big pile of those thick UNK and UNK on 'em STOP 
START the UNK might show he UNK instead but that's what the UNK gives us STOP 
START accident murder suicide take your pick STOP 
START i'll pick murder STOP 
START anything else according to rose he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted UNK in the water got a UNK pole from the UNK UNK and started UNK him out STOP

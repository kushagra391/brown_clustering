START it was among these that UNK identified a photograph of barco it seems that barco UNK himself a UNK man and why not after seven marriages had listed himself for UNK beard roles at the UNK of his fourth murder victim who had said with your beard dear you ought to be in movies secured UNK photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to the hollywood police station to report the UNK and less than five minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of UNK barco STOP 
START on their way they stopped at every gas station along the main UNK to question the UNK STOP 
START finally at ye UNK UNK filling station on UNK avenue they learned that their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the route to san UNK STOP 
START they headed in that direction and at san UNK UNK UNK came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission UNK eating a hot UNK STOP 
START at the moment UNK back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his UNK which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they proceeded to search STOP 
START the UNK however was missing for by that time barco had disposed of it at a UNK in UNK STOP 
START the detectives placed barco under arrest and without UNK him of the nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning STOP 
START thus it was that barco UNK for mere UNK now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been UNK STOP 
START during the return trip barco kept UNK to himself in meaningless phrases such as they're under sand UNK they're better off i tell you i saved their souls STOP 
START the detective UNK on UNK behavior felt that he merely belonged among the UNK citizens of our community who are mentally UNK that he was a more or less UNK nut while in his cell UNK trial for UNK barco in a fit of apprehension made an attempt to take his own life STOP 
START the attempt had failed because when UNK to cut his UNK this murderer of seven women had UNK at the sight of blood STOP 
START the jail authorities UNK no particular significance to the episode offered barco whisky to UNK him the old fellow a UNK UNK refused it and no more was thought of the matter STOP 
START then it was that district attorney welch entered the case STOP 
START a man of UNK ambition with one eye on the UNK of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity STOP 
START it was reported to UNK office that a UNK in the city jail had attempted suicide STOP 
START welch wanted to know why STOP 
START no one knew STOP 
START now welch had a UNK theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at STOP 
START the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test STOP 
START so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their UNK by stating UNK barco we've got the goods on you be a lot better if you come clean STOP 
START at first barco was UNK and UNK STOP 
START but with UNK UNK pursuit of the subject barco finally broke and started UNK to one murder after another STOP 
START by the time barco reached the count of three the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true STOP 
START but if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would throw him into UNK all over america as the hero of a great murder trial STOP 
START welch UNK jail officials to UNK cell STOP 
START but to UNK UNK the police captain UNK UNK UNK in UNK confession STOP 
START barco was clearly a nut STOP 
START it required strength UNK daring to commit murder STOP 
START that UNK a murderer for the first time since his arrest a UNK of spirit lit UNK eyes STOP 
START his UNK had been attacked STOP 
START he UNK and rose to his feet STOP 
START he'd show them is that so UNK STOP 
START well for ten years i've been UNK women STOP 
START i can lead you to every one of the bodies and there ain't four nor five nor six of 'em there's seven the next day the police captain in UNK organized what he termed UNK wild UNK chase STOP 
START for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on UNK murder for ten years and not get caught at it even in hollywood STOP 
START the searching party consisted of the police captain welch barco policemen with UNK newspaper reporters and UNK STOP 
START barco his state of apprehension gone never to return had assumed a UNK which remained his principal attitude from that time on STOP 
START he directed the UNK of UNK to the sand UNK near santa UNK STOP 
START stopping the cars at a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot between two UNK sand hills and indicated a location STOP 
START orders were given to UNK STOP 
START nothing was found STOP 
START welch was worried STOP 
START the police captain UNK STOP 
START the newspaper boys cracked UNK and again UNK pride was aroused STOP 
START with greater precision he again paced off a location this time a little more to the left STOP 
START with UNK and UNK the policemen again started UNK STOP 
START welch was on edge STOP 
START the captain was UNK that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the UNK struck an object STOP 
START there's something here the UNK STOP 
START UNK stopped and everyone gathered around STOP 
START the UNK UNK about with his UNK now raised into view a package UNK wrapped in one of the UNK hollywood sport UNK STOP 
START although it was a mere UNK of the UNK remains it was enough STOP 
START welch was wild with delight STOP 
START his UNK grew as UNK seven UNK brought to light one reward after another STOP 
START now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him STOP 
START it went to his head and his ambition increased STOP 
START it was apparent that welch was in UNK with marshall and would use his power as UNK to drag every possible sensation into the case STOP 
START every new UNK which would provide more copy for UNK pen would thus mean more publicity for welch STOP 
START i knew that both these UNK were waiting with UNK for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand STOP 
START once there the UNK with UNK UNK would provide marshall with UNK UNK multiple UNK viola lake an UNK UNK of another film UNK would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the UNK UNK over the broken reputation of a helpless girl studied welch closely as the trial progressed for any UNK which might give me a lead as to how he might be UNK STOP 
START it wasn't long before i sensed that there was something deeper than UNK ambition back of his desire for UNK destruction STOP 
START he was bitter and UNK toward her personally UNK STOP 
START a UNK fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward UNK UNK or even more serious perhaps that he had UNK a share of them and had then been UNK by some UNK UNK STOP 
START i did not rest until i had UNK the mystery down STOP 
START well here it is STOP 
START one day over a year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel STOP 
START viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing the host or the character of the party she had gone STOP 
START she arrived late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority air was thick with smoke empty bottles were in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor STOP 
START naturally viola had no wish to remain but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival in all UNK to her host STOP 
START and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken UNK was a small table on which she noted a UNK of red UNK UNK from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch STOP 
START as viola sat there a UNK impulse UNK her to remove the shoes and UNK from the UNK feet and as a UNK insert UNK between the toes STOP 
START a little later the district attorney woke up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture UNK on the civic spirit of the UNK in the UNK room of the hotel where his wife as president of the UNK was to UNK STOP 
START he made his way to his UNK bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and UNK selected his hat from the many on the bed STOP 
START then noting neither the absence of his UNK nor the presence of the UNK he made his way to the UNK room and with his usual dignity mounted the UNK STOP 
START the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined STOP 
START the incident aside from reflecting on UNK political career had all but UNK his home life STOP 
START he never rested until he discovered who the UNK was and when he did he UNK UNK on viola lake if ever the chance came his way STOP 
START and here it was such innocent actions are human UNK sometimes set in motion STOP 
START during these first days of the trial i didn't have as much time to UNK with viola as i should have liked STOP 
START in the first place it was difficult for us to meet STOP 
START we couldn't be seen together for the tongue of UNK was ever ready to link our names and the tongue of UNK finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl no matter how innocent STOP 
START i couldn't invite viola to our house for mother UNK refused to receive her STOP 
START now the UNK had not affected my own sense of social values but mother had UNK a reflected glory through it which had opened the doors of los UNK society to her STOP 
START there mother was received by the UNK of UNK lines which are dominated by the UNK of beer UNK the UNK of UNK origin and the UNK whose UNK founded a UNK famous trade in UNK STOP 
START i hated being dragged into the UNK of these UNK STOP 
START but mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone UNK connected with the UNK is ever received in their exclusive UNK STOP 
START in fact it was not until the king of UNK had visited at UNK that mary and UNK were UNK to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and UNK from the UNK STOP 
START mother even went so far as to UNK up for me UNK opportunities with UNK UNK who had been educated abroad and with those of the more UNK los angeles area where a UNK was a girl who had been to high school STOP 
START but at long last came a time when i broke away from mother and her society UNK in order to spend a UNK evening with viola and her UNK at her home STOP 
START however such a UNK of gossip had grown up during the trial that every UNK had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world society and even UNK to my own mother STOP 
START when i arrived at UNK i was shown to my surprise into the kitchen STOP 
START viola greeted me in checked UNK UNK in hand and explained it was the UNK night out and that she herself was preparing dinner STOP 
START i sat and watched proceedings STOP 
START there was to be UNK chicken with dressing UNK UNK UNK new peas with a UNK of UNK UNK UNK and UNK potatoes all chosen prepared and UNK by viola herself STOP

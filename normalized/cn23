START then he calmly and carefully UNK the remaining five shots into the UNK head caught in the UNK back of the chair the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the UNK STOP 
START the body continued to UNK but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the UNK UNK mass out of the UNK STOP 
START he slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up UNK at the sound of the shots STOP 
START he heard their UNK and then the sounds of UNK as they UNK the snake right on the porch with wood UNK STOP 
START it was only then that he turned to look at penny STOP 
START she was sitting on the edge of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found her STOP 
START the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now UNK into her eyes and the lines of her mouth STOP 
START but her hands were calm now STOP 
START she's got UNK thought keith STOP 
START she's got more UNK than any other woman in the world STOP 
START keith said penny keith you were wonderful STOP 
START i don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life but i am STOP 
START thank you keith STOP 
START he smiled at her sincerity STOP 
START and for the UNK time that week he was startled at her beauty STOP 
START strange STOP 
START seven years they'd been married STOP 
START he knew her mind pretty well by now its quick UNK and UNK its painful insistence on truth and UNK its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to UNK even in part STOP 
START but her beauty always surprised him UNK STOP 
START i realize that this is hardly the time to say it penny said keith STOP 
START but knowing you i know that you're glad to be alive and grateful and sorry because i killed the snake even though i had to STOP 
START isn't that so lowered her eyes STOP 
START yes she said almost in a whisper as if UNK to a crime STOP 
START the snake was beautiful wasn't it keith his voice getting UNK in spite of himself as he UNK to control his growing anger STOP 
START it was a king UNK the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle didn't it it penny did not answer STOP 
START now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him STOP 
START we're all god's creatures aren't we was UNK now STOP 
START all of us every UNK UNK and UNK and killer in that jungle STOP 
START you love this village and these UNK brown people because they're god's creatures too STOP 
START and you love UNK that black bastard of a servant even a little more because he's a beautiful man STOP 
START and he loves you because you're a beautiful woman STOP 
START we're all god's creatures aren't we penny of us that is except me STOP 
START you hate me you hate my UNK because i like to UNK STOP 
START you actually hate me and we both know it because i killed that UNK snake STOP 
START well why don't you say something would not rise to his mood STOP 
START there isn't anything left to say is there keith softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because keith was between her and the UNK STOP 
START he knew she was not UNK not even angry at him STOP 
START just as he knew that she had stopped loving him STOP 
START the UNK has its UNK in the UNK of the world the towering white UNK of the UNK that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet STOP 
START for a brief period each year the UNK of the sun are warm enough to UNK some of the UNK piled a mile deep at the base of the UNK and then the UNK UNK in the daytime at high noon and UNK of UNK of water begin their slow UNK under the UNK and across the UNK hanging UNK on their long UNK journey to the sea running east past the UNK UNK of UNK UNK and UNK then turning south and UNK down through the UNK of UNK past the UNK hills and into UNK past UNK and UNK until the hard water of the melting UNK UNK with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to UNK with the UNK salt depths of the bay of UNK STOP 
START keith UNK had looked down on the UNK more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the UNK of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was UNK himself through outer space STOP 
START but keith looked down more than up STOP 
START he thought of the UNK below him and of the wild strange UNK beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to UNK in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the UNK and animals the UNK STOP 
START at first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of UNK oxford after the war STOP 
START but after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself STOP 
START wing UNK in the UNK do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves STOP 
START and UNK record of UNK made him a man to listen to a man paradoxically who might even survive STOP 
START he became a UNK pilot after the UNK over the UNK in the big UNK STOP 
START the UNK was UNK weapon of UNK and flying a UNK plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war STOP 
START he knew how to shoot down nazis STOP 
START and he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else including the pilot of the plane with the UNK on it because he was UNK incapable of fear STOP 
START that was true but only half the truth STOP 
START the other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself STOP 
START he enjoyed the killing STOP 
START not defending england or being an ace or fighting for humanity STOP 
START he enjoyed killing STOP 
START and he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a nazi STOP 
START nowadays we talk as though the UNK were just a short UNK STOP 
START the nazis UNK britain so the UNK UNK and shot them all down STOP 
START not quite STOP 
START it was a war of nerves of UNK of UNK endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country became ultimately an UNK UNK to the nazis who were better organized and UNK superior STOP 
START it took a long time before the british UNK the balance STOP 
START keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be UNK STOP 
START they UNK him over his protests not including his true reason for wanting to fly and put him in the command offices STOP 
START that was where he met penny STOP 
START he was aware of her as a UNK UNK american UNK a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work regardless of how important she might have thought she was in the command offices but that was all STOP 
START penny knew him better on her part STOP 
START he had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without UNK STOP 
START they don't go for UNK muscle as a rule STOP 
START he had strength in his UNK frame but it was like the UNK steel in a UNK STOP 
START he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of UNK that give away the power in UNK and UNK STOP 
START his hair was black already UNK at the UNK in the classic UNK the only one permitted to a man STOP 
START the pretty little UNK UNK said he had the look of UNK and penny UNK the UNK had to admit that in this case it applied STOP 
START keith was an UNK STOP 
START penny and keith had no romance STOP 
START no dates or UNK STOP 
START but they met in one UNK moment that gave them to one another instantly STOP 
START the command offices were in the border country up north where the radar systems UNK their intelligence reports and the fighters were UNK to harry the enemy STOP 
START the nazis knew this of course and while their chief UNK was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit STOP 
START this time they had been lucky STOP 
START the command post was underground and well UNK STOP 
START but there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps STOP 
START there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as UNK when a direct hit comes along STOP 
START this one was actually more of a near miss STOP 
START the bomb plunged into the ground near the post but not precisely into the command room itself STOP 
START there was a UNK cracking sound as the concrete started to UNK the air filled with dust and flying UNK and everyone in the room men and women hit the floor and used the UNK as UNK as ordered STOP 
START that is everyone but keith and penny STOP 
START they stood there just the two of them in the rocking UNK blast STOP 
START keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more penny on her feet UNK because she cared too much STOP 
START the bomb was a solitary one STOP 
START the blast UNK but did not destroy the room STOP 
START UNK eyes met UNK as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction STOP 
START and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the UNK and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the UNK to penny and took her hand in his STOP 
START the UNK married them on the next day STOP 
START after the war penny had wanted keith at least to visit her home with her STOP 
START she came from ohio from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed it was to UNK farmers STOP 
START but to UNK UNK mind such acreage sounded rather UNK STOP 
START it wasn't that however which decided them not to go to america STOP 
START keith told penny about his dream to return to india and burma STOP 
START he stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the UNK STOP 
START he didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself STOP 
START he couldn't stop killing STOP 
START that was his true love not penny STOP 
START the terrible power of a gun the thing that UNK the soul out of a living body man or UNK was one he never wanted to lose STOP 
START and in the hunting land this hunger was considered to be a noble thing STOP 
START when they got to UNK in UNK he was happy STOP 
START this is a paradise for UNK STOP 
START this was the land of the UNK the great water buffalo with UNK forty inches across the spread STOP 
START the great black UNK STOP 
START the UNK buck the jungle UNK that is even more noble than the UNK UNK STOP 
START he even UNK UNK although the UNK UNK is not quite as UNK as his african cousin STOP 
START but there are big UNK in both countries STOP 
START these were the ones keith sought out the UNK the ones who killed for the joy of it like himself STOP 
START he and penny would go out on UNK UNK raised from UNK in the UNK STOP 
START and while he was ever alert for game and most particularly a UNK penny UNK at the UNK they were UNK STOP 
START they came upon UNK deer at UNK pools STOP 
START UNK UNK across their path UNK STOP 
START there were fantastic flowers without UNK and UNK birds without song STOP 
START UNK deer played around the feet of the UNK or fled when the mighty legs UNK too close STOP 
START wild UNK watched their progress with little UNK eyes and UNK UNK when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the STOP

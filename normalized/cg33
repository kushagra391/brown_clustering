START more likely you simply told yourself as you handed us the book that it UNK little what we UNK providing we UNK the discipline of UNK STOP 
START for UNK sake i will not say that the UNK and UNK UNK UNK of those UNK UNK itself into my soul STOP 
START besides that particular message does no more than UNK UNK the roar in all fresh blood STOP 
START but what you could not know of course was how smoothly the UNK UNK was to lead into an american UNK of my own UNK under whose UNK we UNK were to come if not of age then into a bright UNK UNK of it STOP 
START i do not suppose you ever heard of f. scott UNK living or dead and moreover i do not suppose that even if you had his legend would have seemed to you to warrant more than a UNK of disapproval STOP 
START neither his UNK his UNK nor his despair were UNK to yours STOP 
START he might have been the man in the moon for all you could have understood him STOP 
START but he was no man in the moon to me STOP 
START although his tender nights were not the ones i dreamed of nor was it for UNK sports cars tall drinks and swimming pools nor yet for money or what money buys that i burned i too was burning and watching myself burn STOP 
START the flame was simply of a different kind STOP 
START it was symbolized at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image by that UNK UNK candle of UNK st. vincent UNK that candle which from the UNK where she UNK it became a UNK to us but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall as a funeral UNK to last even the evening let alone the night STOP 
START one should not of course UNK the head off a flower and expect its UNK to UNK on STOP 
START yet this passion for passion now that i look back on it with passion spent seems somewhat UNK and UNK though as a UNK miss UNK perfectly controlled her notes STOP 
START only what else was she singing but the old song of songs that most ancient of UNK that nature plays with such UNK response upon young nerves this is not so little STOP 
START perhaps the mere fact that by UNK on the nerves nature can UNK in the most ordinary of us temporarily anyway the sleeping poet and in poets can discover their immortality is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to which we can UNK can see it as UNK that an extra hormone casually fed into our chemistry may UNK us to lay down our lives for a lover or a friend can take it as no more than another UNK torn from the mystery of the soul STOP 
START but it could also be looked at from the other end of the spectrum STOP 
START one could see this chemical UNK as in itself a miracle STOP 
START in any case miss UNK UNK bitterness her variations on the theme that the world was not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love her constant and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of UNK since it required no scenery or UNK drew from the me that i was when i fell upon her UNK an overwhelming UNK STOP 
START but all this i am well aware is the UNK UNK of love and although i have always liked to think that it was to the UNK UNK and to that alone that i listened i know well enough that it was not STOP 
START if i am to speak the whole truth about my knowledge of love i will have to stop trying to UNK the UNK UNK STOP 
START there is another side of love more nearly symbolized by the UNK of the UNK UNK or better still perhaps by the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP 
START whether you experienced the passion of desire i have of course no way of knowing nor indeed have i wished with even the most UNK UNK of a wish to know for the fact that one constitutes by one's mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any UNK upon this part of one's UNK experience more UNK more UNK more deeply UNK than an UNK from a stranger STOP 
START i UNK from the very thought STOP 
START at the same time i am aware that my UNK could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my UNK as an UNK sign since theirs is a science of UNK if one UNK they say it is because one loves one UNK they say it is because one is afraid one UNK they say it is because one desires according to them whatever one UNK one feels what one feels in fact is the opposite STOP 
START well normally UNK or normally normal UNK or merely UNK do the UNK readers by the way allow UNK to have moral taste i have never wanted to know what you knew of passion STOP 
START you probably would not remember since you never seemed to remember even the same moments as i much less their intensity one sunny UNK on fifth avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such UNK at the farm STOP 
START i can see us now STOP 
START we had been walking quite UNK for despite your being so small and me so tall your stride in those days could easily match mine STOP 
START we had stopped before a shop window to UNK its UNK display when you suddenly turned to me looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats and with your nervous UNK there are things i must tell you about this man you are UNK which he does not know himself STOP 
START if you had screamed right there in the street where we stood i could not have felt more fear STOP 
START with scarcely a UNK of excuse i fled STOP 
START i fled however not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to UNK from you that the things about my UNK in the sense you meant the word things which you had been UNK yourself to tell me as a painful part of your UNK duty were things which i had already insisted upon finding out for myself despite i may now say the UNK UNK of making the discovery on principle yes on principle and in cold blood because i was resolved as a modern woman not to be a UNK waiting for life but to UNK life by the throat STOP 
START i had developed too UNK a UNK to be afraid of UNK STOP 
START what i fled from was my fear of what UNK you might UNK without meaning to about my father and yourself STOP 
START but i can see from this latest trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it is than the will STOP 
START while my memory holds with UNK UNK as i cannot too often stress to my UNK when it comes to my UNK it UNK and UNK and toys with UNK like a UNK in the hope of UNK me from them STOP 
START just as i was about to UNK upon my discovery of the UNK of the leaf of love memory UNK at being asked to yield its UNK secrets UNK ahead of me calling back over its shoulder UNK it STOP 
START cut it out STOP 
START but i will not UNK it or cut it out STOP 
START it is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless victim UNK to the rock of experience and left to the UNK of chance STOP 
START if to be innocent is to be helpless then i had been as are we all helpless at the start STOP 
START but the time came when i was no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless STOP 
START helpless in that sense i can never be again STOP 
START however i confess my hope that i will be innocent again not with a UNK UNK innocence but rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh to reach the bone STOP 
START for innocence of all the UNK of the spirit is i believe the one most to be prayed for STOP 
START although it is constantly made to look foolish too simple to come in out of the rain people say who have found in the innocent an UNK it does not mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks STOP 
START it UNK that things are as they seem when they seem best and when they seem worst it UNK them STOP 
START to innocence a word given is a word that will be kept STOP 
START UNK innocence does unto others as it expects to be done by STOP 
START but when these expectations are once too often ground into the dust innocence can UNK since its strength is according to the strength of him who UNK it STOP 
START the innocence of which i speak is i know not UNK STOP 
START but i insist upon believing that even when it is lost it may like paradise be UNK STOP 
START however it was not of innocence in general that i was speaking but of perhaps the UNK and surely the least important side of it which is innocence in romantic love STOP 
START here if anywhere it is not wholly UNK STOP 
START to you for instance the word innocence in this UNK probably retained its biblical or should i say technical sense and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear by saying that i lost or rather handed over what you would have considered to be my innocence two weeks before i was UNK entitled and in fact by UNK required to hand it over along with what other goods and UNK i had STOP 
START but to me innocence is far less tangible STOP 
START i had long since begun to lose my general innocence when i lost my trust in you but this special innocence i lost before ever i loved through my discovery that one could UNK with desire and even experience a UNK delight that had nothing nothing whatever to do with friendship or liking let alone with love STOP 
START i knew this knowledge to be UNK at the time i acquired it these many years later after all the UNK UNK or yielded to the UNK UNK and the UNK UNK since endured i call it UNK still STOP 
START you i could UNK to it remained innocent in this sense until the end STOP 
START yours but not mine was an age in which innocence was UNK and carefully if not perhaps altogether UNK preserved STOP 
START you had grown up at a time when the most UNK mark of a lady was the UNK me UNK UNK plain across her face STOP 
START moreover because of the particular UNK on your family UNK through what may only have been one UNK moment on your UNK part and because you had the UNK kitchen and UNK bed of your childhood to UNK what you obviously most desired with both your conscious and unconscious person what you bent your whole will UNK and intelligence upon was to be a lady STOP 
START before being daughter wife or mother before being UNK a word now UNK both socially and politically of the UNK you children of UNK UNK on it before being sorry for the poor progressive about public health and UNK if somewhat UNK UNK indeed first and foremost you were a lady STOP 
START there was of course more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your UNK eye than the UNK UNK UNK of her virtue STOP 
START a lady you made clear to me both by UNK and example never raised her voice or UNK in her chair never failed in social UNK in heaven for instance would not mention st. john the UNK head never UNK or UNK or UNK in company never reminded others of her physical presence by UNK sound or gesture never UNK in public scenes or private UNK never spoke of money save in terms of UNK suffering never UNK or UNK never stressed but always UNK the UNK of anything from sin to death itself STOP

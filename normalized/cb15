START the providence journal editorial jan. 25 entitled east greenwich faces a housing development problem points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours STOP 
START your suggested solution it seems to me is UNK UNK and is UNK with your generally realistic attitude toward and UNK of sound planning STOP 
START first of all there is ample area in east greenwich already UNK in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested STOP 
START this land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town STOP 
START the demand for these lots can be met for some time to come STOP 
START this would seem to indicate that we are trying neither to UNK an UNK of UNK nor are we setting up such standards for development that only the UNK could afford to buy land and build in the new sites STOP 
START what we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development STOP 
START it is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs STOP 
START UNK inc. is approximately half way through a UNK UNK of their real estate tax STOP 
START the wisdom of UNK such tax UNK is another matter but this particular instance is in my opinion completely satisfactory STOP 
START the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicates a UNK for this property in excess of two million dollars STOP 
START with our current UNK per hundred tax rate it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant as the best way to meet these problems STOP 
START in order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure STOP 
START as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow STOP 
START mr. richard UNK executive director of the new hampshire state planning and development commission in his remarks to the UNK conference on industrial development at providence on october 8 1960 warned against the UNK of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to UNK municipal services such as schools when he said if this is the fundamental reason for a UNK interest or if this is the basic approach success if any will be difficult to obtain STOP 
START he went on to say in the first place industry per UNK is not dedicated to the role of UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START it is not in business for the purpose of UNK increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be STOP 
START while UNK UNK cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in UNK growth STOP 
START we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities one currently UNK double sessions in their schools and the other facing this prospect next year STOP 
START it has already been reported in your newspapers that the east greenwich school committee is considering UNK to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future UNK for a school population that we know will increase STOP 
START if they are to be UNK for UNK in their planning what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other UNK submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life STOP 
START the UNK course of UNK that you recommend is currently UNK by the town of east greenwich and had its UNK long before we learned what it was called STOP 
START for example 1 STOP 
START the east greenwich police department UNK the radio transmission facilities of the warwick police department thereby eliminating UNK of facilities and UNK police coordination in the UNK UNK area of the two communities STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START the east greenwich fire district services parts of warwick as well as east greenwich STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START the taxpayers of east greenwich appropriate sums of money as do other kent county communities for the support of the kent county memorial hospital a regional facility STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START the east greenwich free library receives financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement its UNK STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START UNK were put out last year to the city of warwick as reported in your newspapers suggesting investigation of a common UNK disposal area to service the UNK and UNK areas of warwick along with east greenwich STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START east greenwich was one of the first rhode island towns to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START the education program for UNK children conducted by the east greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community STOP 
START i feel compelled to write this because i am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as east greenwich STOP 
START i believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the UNK of nearly all the planning programs they have devised STOP 
START these programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land UNK tell them when where and in what manner the community shall grow STOP 
START we have far less to fear in the UNK family than we have in the UNK UNK under these conditions STOP 
START until professional planners meet this situation squarely and UNK the concepts of UNK in a manner acceptable to the courts i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny STOP 
START i would like very much on behalf of my husband and myself to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the UNK fund STOP 
START it is indeed true as stated in the famous novel of our day for whom the bell UNK that no man is an island entirely of itself man is a piece of the continent a part of the main STOP 
START thanks to the UNK of mr. UNK j. UNK president of the temple UNK el UNK UNK pastor of the UNK street methodist church felix UNK of the imperial knife co. to mrs. UNK UNK regional director of the national conference of christians and jews who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund STOP 
START it is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man and therefore that most people are noble helpful and good STOP 
START UNK you my friends for it is through love and service that UNK becomes a reality STOP 
START i am a UNK at mount pleasant high school STOP 
START my future plans are to become a language teacher STOP 
START of course having this desire i am very interested in education STOP 
START a few weeks ago i read in the bulletin that there were to be given chinese classes in cranston STOP 
START the article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over and must not be going to high school to attend these classes STOP 
START the following week i read in the sunday paper that the students of russia begin european and UNK languages in the seventh grade STOP 
START i wish you could see the situation as i see it STOP 
START if russian pupils have to take these languages how come american students have a choice whether or not to take a language but have to face so many exceptions do not think that america is like russia not in the least am proud of my country the small city i live in my wonderful parents my friends and my school i am also a young able and willing girl who wants to study the chinese language but is not old enough STOP 
START then people wonder why russian pupils are more advanced than american students STOP 
START well there lies your answer STOP 
START at the height of the first UNK we had it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency STOP 
START however the east providence rescue squad made its way through to my home in time of UNK STOP 
START words cannot tell of the UNK attention and comfort their service gave to me STOP 
START the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful STOP 
START the rescue squad is to be praised UNK for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather STOP 
START had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did perhaps i would not be here to UNK them at this time STOP 
START many thanks for a job well done STOP 
START the providence sunday journal article jan. 29 asking whether american taxpayers are being UNK by a UNK UNK to pay for the care of war veterans who have UNK UNK sounds as though the providence journal is desperate for news STOP 
START usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page STOP 
START on the question of admission to veterans administration hospitals of UNK and UNK UNK veterans it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service STOP 
START it can UNK itself before discharge from service or it can come out years later STOP 
START there is one other point we should never lose sight of many veterans who enter UNK hospitals as UNK cases later qualify as UNK STOP 
START no UNK could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the UNK years STOP 
START the arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would UNK UNK or do away entirely with hospital care for the UNK case seem to be UNK UNK and UNK with the wishes of the general public STOP 
START i believe in priority for UNK UNK veterans in admission to UNK hospitals STOP 
START but i don't believe we should close the door on UNK patients STOP 
START this matter is of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injuries for many veterans STOP 
START some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long STOP 
START there's a reason for this length of stay STOP 
START first of all the UNK physician in the UNK hospital gets the patient as a new patient STOP 
START he has no experience with this UNK previous medical record STOP 
START if the doctor is UNK he wants to study the patient STOP 
START as a result it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient STOP 
START UNK the UNK physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient STOP 
START so he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or UNK STOP 
START the american public must be presented with the facts concerning UNK UNK STOP 
START the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a UNK hospital the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other STOP 
START the responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a UNK hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital STOP 
START an adequate system of UNK hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals STOP 
START it seems that open season upon UNK UNK is once more upon us STOP 
START the american medical association is once again UNK out its UNK propaganda based upon the high cost of the veterans administration medical program to the american taxpayer STOP 
START do they the UNK offer any solution other than UNK UNK of a medical system UNK anywhere in the world veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at UNK hospitals will grow UNK as age UNK illness STOP 
START nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the UNK on the health problem UNK the aged STOP 
START they opposed the UNK bill which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through UNK payroll deduction they supported the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars matched incidentally by a federal grant to UNK STOP

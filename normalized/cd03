START one hundred years ago there existed in england the association for the promotion of the unity of UNK STOP 
START representing as it did the efforts of only UNK individuals of the roman and anglican churches and UNK a communion of prayer UNK to rome this association produced little fruit and in fact was condemned by the holy office in UNK STOP 
START now again in 1961 in england there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so UNK discussed as christian unity STOP 
START the church unity UNK january UNK was UNK devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches STOP 
START many people seem hopeful yet it is difficult to UNK whether or not there will be any more real UNK of christian unity in 1961 than there was in UNK STOP 
START but it must be readily seen that the religious picture in england has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to UNK hope at least on the catholic side STOP 
START for the tide is well on the turn as the london catholic weekly universe has written STOP 
START i came to england last summer to do research on the UNK letters of cardinal UNK STOP 
START as an american catholic of irish UNK i came with certain UNK and expectations UNK influenced by UNK and the general UNK literature of england i knew only a UNK country STOP 
START since arriving here however i have formed a far different religious picture of present-day england STOP 
START in representing part of this new picture i will be UNK some of my own personal experiences reactions and judgments my primary aim is to UNK what UNK themselves are saying and writing and UNK about the roman and anglican churches and about the present religious state of england STOP 
START since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some UNK from the wholly black suit my roman collar and black UNK usually identify me in england as a roman catholic UNK STOP 
START in any case i have always been treated with the UNK UNK by UNK even in UNK and UNK where UNK feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and UNK STOP 
START nowhere have i seen public expression of UNK STOP 
START on my first guy UNK day here i found catholics as well as UNK UNK with the traditional UNK and UNK and was told that most UNK either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day STOP 
START a birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled the true story of guy UNK which began when you pile your guy on the UNK tomorrow night i wonder how much of the true story of guy UNK you will remember the UNK years since the first guy UNK night much of the story has been forgotten so here is a UNK STOP 
START the article proceeded to give an UNK account of a catholic plot to kill king james 1 STOP 
START in spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the UNK of UNK and other UNK of the UNK and UNK the catholic UNK of england one hundred years ago was a very small one four per cent or UNK which did not enjoy a UNK hearing from the general public STOP 
START the return of the catholic UNK in UNK was looked upon with UNK UNK and in fact was charged with being a gesture of UNK STOP 
START in UNK UNK UNK had to write his UNK with his UNK feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from english readers STOP 
START now in 1961 the catholic population of england is still quite small ten per cent or 5 million it represents a very considerable percentage of the UNK population STOP 
START a protestant woman UNK to me over the large crowds going in and out of the birmingham UNK catholic church on sunday UNK STOP 
START she found this a UNK because as she said only six per cent of english people are UNK STOP 
START she may not have been exact on this number but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten STOP 
START from many sides come remarks that protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval UNK look all but empty during services STOP 
START a catholic priest recently UNK how in the chapel of a large city university following anglican UNK at which there was a congregation of twelve he celebrated mass before more than a hundred STOP 
START the protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches STOP 
START according to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england the total of confirmed members is UNK but only UNK are registered on the parochial church rolls and over 27 million people in england are baptized into the church of england but roughly only a UNK of them continue STOP 
START an amazing article in the manchester UNK of last november entitled fate of UNK churches states than an UNK commission reported last month that in the church of england alone there are UNK churches which are UNK now or will be in 20 UNK time STOP 
START a further UNK anglican churches have been UNK since 1948 STOP 
START and in the last five years the methodist chapel committee has authorized the UNK or more often the sale of UNK UNK STOP 
START most of these former churches are now used as UNK but neither UNK nor UNK object to selling churches to roman catholics and have done so STOP 
START while it must be said that these same protestants have built some new churches during this period and that religious population shifts have UNK churches a principal reason for this phenomenon of UNK is that fewer protestants are going to church STOP 
START it should be admitted too that there is a good percentage of UNK or UNK catholics one paper writes 50 per cent STOP 
START still it is clear from such reports and apparently clear from the remarks of many people that protestants are UNK and catholics increasing STOP 
START an anglican UNK in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true STOP 
START a century ago UNK saw that liberalism what we now might call UNK would gradually but definitely make its mark on english protestantism and that even high UNK would someday no longer be a UNK UNK against UNK errors more fundamental than its own STOP 
START that day is perhaps today 1961 and it seems no longer very meaningful to call england a protestant country STOP 
START one of the UNK of the present UNK for christian unity is that there are not relatively speaking many real christians to UNK STOP 
START many english catholics are proud of their UNK and know that they are in a new UNK STOP 
START the london universe devoted its UNK issue last december 8 to UNK out various aspects of catholic progress during the last one hundred years STOP 
START with traditional UNK spirit some UNK claim that english UNK is UNK at its best STOP 
START i have found myself saying with other foreigners here that english catholics are good catholics STOP 
START it has been my experience to find as many men as women in church and to hear almost everyone in church congregations UNK the latin prayers and responses at mass STOP 
START they hope of course to UNK the UNK population to the catholic faith and at every sunday UNK they UNK by heart the prayer for england o blessed virgin mary mother of god and our most gentle queen and mother look down in mercy upon england thy UNK and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee STOP 
START UNK for our separated UNK that with us in the one true UNK they may be united to the chief UNK the UNK of thy son STOP 
START a UNK often to be heard in catholic churches is faith of our fathers which UNK in UNK ancient faith that endured UNK and which UNK faith of our fathers UNK prayers shall win our country back to thee STOP 
START the english UNK are widely UNK quite naturally and now there is great hope that the forty UNK and cardinal UNK will soon be UNK STOP 
START because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers english catholics have always strongly UNK the charge of being UNK STOP 
START i have not seen this charge made during my stay here but apparently it is still in the air STOP 
START for example a writer in a recent number of the queen UNK states that of the UNK UNK the only one which the english catholics really UNK is the suggestion that they are UNK STOP 
START in this connection it has been observed that the increasing number of irish catholics priests and UNK in england while certainly seen as good for UNK is nevertheless a source of UNK for some of the more UNK english catholics especially when these UNK offer to remind their christian UNK of this good STOP 
START one of the more UNK changes that have taken place since the UNK century is the situation of catholics at oxford and cambridge universities STOP 
START at oxford one hundred years ago there were very few catholics partly because religious tests were removed only in UNK STOP 
START moreover for those few there was almost no UNK representation in the city to care for their religious needs STOP 
START now not only are there considerably more UNK as students and professors at oxford but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the UNK members of the university STOP 
START some catholic priests lecture there UNK attend UNK and row on the UNK with UNK students STOP 
START further evidence that roman UNK UNK a more favorable position today than in UNK is the UNK attention given to it in the mass media of england STOP 
START the general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the manchester UNK and the sunday observer implies a UNK recognition that the catholic church is now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant churches STOP 
START on successive UNK during october 1960 paul UNK a UNK wrote articles in the observer UNK UNK of the church of england the church of rome and the UNK church STOP 
START the catholic priest though somewhat UNK drawn easily came out the best STOP 
START there were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican UNK who was indeed UNK as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as UNK STOP 
START such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of UNK england STOP 
START there was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on UNK where comments were equally made by an anglican UNK a free church minister and a catholic priest STOP 
START catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs sometimes discussing the christian faith on an equal UNK with protestant UNK STOP 
START a notable example of this was the discussion of christian unity by the catholic UNK of UNK dr. UNK and the anglican UNK of york dr. UNK recently appointed UNK of UNK STOP 
START the good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in england STOP 
START the holy sacrifice of the mass with UNK has been UNK several times in recent months STOP 
START and it was interesting to observe that UNK television film on christmas eve was the UNK of st. UNK STOP 
START of course the UNK event that has UNK upset the traditional pattern of english religious history was the friendly visit paid by dr. UNK then anglican UNK of UNK to the UNK last december STOP 
START it was the first time an english UNK has done this since the UNK century STOP 
START english catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope STOP 
START almost daily something is reported which feeds this catholic hope in england statistics of the increasing numbers of UNK and irish catholic UNK of a protestant minister in UNK who has offered to allow a catholic priest to UNK from his UNK report that a catholic UNK had been requested to teach in a UNK secondary school during the UNK of one of its masters startling statement in a respectable UNK that catholics if the present system is still in operation will constitute almost one-third of the house of UNK in the next generation report that 200 protestant UNK and UNK attended a UNK mass offered for christian unity at a catholic church in UNK during the church unity UNK STOP

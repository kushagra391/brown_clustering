START in the imagination of the nineteenth century the greek UNK and shakespeare stand side by side their UNK UNK all the immense UNK of historical circumstance religious belief and poetic form STOP 
START we no longer use the particular terms of UNK and victor UNK STOP 
START but we UNK by their insight STOP 
START the word tragedy UNK for us in a single span both the greek and the UNK example STOP 
START the sense of relationship UNK the historical truth that shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual works of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START it UNK the UNK fact that the UNK mixed tragedy and comedy whereas the UNK kept the two UNK severely distinct STOP 
START it UNK our UNK awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the two languages and styles of dramatic presentation STOP 
START the UNK of a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any sense of UNK STOP 
START comparable UNK of life are at work in UNK and UNK and UNK STOP 
START we see at once what victor UNK means when he calls UNK a northern UNK of the house of UNK STOP 
START UNK seems to lie in a range of UNK and the fate of UNK UNK in that of UNK STOP 
START the UNK of hell search out their UNK in UNK UNK as they do in the tent of richard 3 STOP 
START oedipus and UNK attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness STOP 
START it is not between UNK and shakespeare that the western mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life STOP 
START it is after the late seventeenth century STOP 
START i say the late seventeenth century because UNK whom UNK did not really know stands on the far side of the UNK STOP 
START the image of man which enters into force with UNK is still vital in UNK and UNK STOP 
START it is the triumph of UNK and secular metaphysics which marks the point of no return STOP 
START shakespeare is closer to UNK than he is to pope and UNK STOP 
START to say this is to set aside the UNK of time STOP 
START but it is true nevertheless STOP 
START the UNK of the imagination implicit in UNK tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age of UNK and UNK STOP 
START it is only then that the ancient habits of feeling and the classic UNK of material and psychological experience were abandoned STOP 
START with the UNK de la UNK and the UNK the things UNK of in UNK philosophy seem to pass from the world STOP 
START in greek tragedy as in shakespeare UNK actions are UNK by forces which UNK man STOP 
START the reality of UNK UNK that of the UNK UNK sisters wait for the soul of UNK STOP 
START we cannot conceive of oedipus without a UNK nor of UNK without a ghost STOP 
START the shadows cast by the UNK of greek and UNK drama UNK into a greater darkness STOP 
START and the UNK of the natural world is party to the action STOP 
START the UNK over the sacred wood at UNK and the UNK in king UNK are caused by more than weather STOP 
START in tragedy lightning is a UNK STOP 
START but it can no longer be so once benjamin franklin the UNK of the new rational man has UNK a UNK to it STOP 
START the tragic stage is a platform extending UNK between heaven and hell STOP 
START those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace or UNK STOP 
START oedipus and UNK UNK us how little of the world belongs to man STOP 
START UNK is the UNK of a brief and dangerous watch and to all UNK whether at UNK or on the UNK at UNK the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle STOP 
START it UNK the night UNK to fire or UNK STOP 
START but at the touch of UNK and UNK the noble or hideous UNK which had UNK the mind since UNK blood cried out for UNK disappeared altogether or took UNK UNK among the UNK of UNK STOP 
START modern UNK have lost the art of UNK restless spirits back to UNK STOP 
START in UNK in UNK england and at UNK the UNK of UNK power were stable and UNK STOP 
START the wheel of social life spun around the royal or UNK UNK STOP 
START from it UNK of order and degree led to the UNK UNK of the common man STOP 
START tragedy UNK such a UNK STOP 
START its sphere is that of royal courts UNK UNK and UNK ambitions STOP 
START the same UNK of swift UNK and UNK decline apply to oedipus and UNK because they applied also to UNK and essex STOP 
START and the fate of such men has tragic UNK because it is public STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK perform their tragic actions before the eyes of the UNK STOP 
START similarly the UNK of UNK UNK or UNK engage the UNK of the state STOP 
START they are enacted at the heart of the body UNK STOP 
START hence the natural setting of tragedy is the palace gate the public square or the court chamber STOP 
START greek and UNK life and to a certain extent the life of UNK shared this character of intense publicity STOP 
START UNK and UNK UNK in the open street and died on the open UNK STOP 
START with the rise to power of the middle class the UNK of UNK in human affairs shifted from the public to the private STOP 
START the art of UNK and richardson is founded on an awareness of this great change STOP 
START UNK an action had possessed the UNK of tragedy only if it involved high UNK and if it occurred in the public view STOP 
START behind the tragic hero stands the chorus the crowd or the UNK UNK STOP 
START in the eighteenth century there UNK for the first time the notion of a private tragedy or nearly for the first time there having been a small number of UNK domestic UNK such as the famous UNK of UNK STOP 
START in la UNK and UNK tragedy is made intimate STOP 
START and private tragedy became the chosen ground not of drama but of the new UNK art of the novel STOP 
START the novel was not only the UNK of the new secular UNK private world of the middle class STOP 
START it served also as a literary form exactly appropriate to the UNK audience of modern urban culture STOP 
START i have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements with regard to the character of the greek and UNK public STOP 
START but one major fact seems UNK STOP 
START until the UNK of rational UNK the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic and UNK STOP 
START available evidence regarding the natural world the course of history and the UNK of human action were translated into imaginative designs or UNK STOP 
START classic UNK and christianity are such UNK of the imagination STOP 
START they order the manifold levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which extends from UNK matter to the UNK stars STOP 
START there had not yet UNK between understanding and expression the new languages of mathematics and scientific formulas STOP 
START the poet was by definition a UNK his UNK and UNK being natural organizations of reality STOP 
START and in these organizations certain UNK notions played a UNK part UNK both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole toward which all UNK UNK STOP 
START i mean such concepts as the presence of the supernatural in human affairs the UNK of grace and divine UNK the idea of UNK the UNK over oedipus the UNK of the UNK to UNK or god's UNK with his people in UNK STOP 
START i refer to the notion that the structure of society is a UNK of the cosmic design and that history UNK to patterns of justice and UNK as if it were a morality play set in motion by the gods for our instruction STOP 
START these UNK and the manner in which they were UNK into poetry or UNK by poetic form are UNK to western life from the time of UNK to that of shakespeare STOP 
START and although they were as i have indicated under increasing strain at the time of UNK they are still alive in his theatre STOP 
START they are the essential force behind the UNK of tragedy STOP 
START they are as UNK present in the UNK and oedipus as in UNK king UNK and UNK STOP 
START after the seventeenth century the audience ceased to be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits of UNK language would be natural or immediately familiar STOP 
START concepts such as grace UNK UNK UNK or the chain of being which are everywhere implicit in classic and UNK tragedy lose their vitality STOP 
START they become UNK UNK of a private and UNK UNK or mere UNK in religious customs which had in them a UNK part of active belief STOP 
START after shakespeare the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer the blind UNK the poets or UNK performing his art in the face of hell STOP 
START they are UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START and their UNK are not the dramatic poets but the prose UNK STOP 
START the UNK were the immediate UNK of this tremendous change STOP 
START they were not yet prepared to accept it as UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK the UNK UNK of UNK UNK organic metaphysics victor UNK image of the poets as the UNK and UNK UNK legislators are related elements in the UNK action fought by the UNK against the new scientific UNK STOP 
START from this action sprang the idea of somehow UNK greek and UNK drama into a new total form capable of UNK to life the ancient moral and poetic responses STOP 
START the dream of achieving a synthesis between the UNK and the UNK genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time of shelley and victor UNK to that of UNK STOP 
START it could not really be fulfilled STOP 
START the UNK into which the UNK tried to breath life no longer UNK to the realities of thought and feeling STOP 
START but the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works and these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age of UNK and UNK STOP 
START the wedding of the UNK to the northern genius was one of the dominant UNK in UNK thought STOP 
START his italian journey was a poet's version of those UNK UNK across the UNK of the german UNK of the middle ages STOP 
START the dream of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew german ambitions toward rome and UNK STOP 
START UNK asks in UNK UNK whether we know the land where the lemon trees flower and the light of the UNK UNK through UNK UNK and the roman UNK STOP 
START UNK believed that the UNK spirit with its grave strength but UNK UNK of brutality and UNK should be UNK with the old UNK wisdom and UNK of the UNK STOP 
START on the UNK ground of poetic form he felt that in the drama of the future the greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to the UNK vision of tragic will STOP 
START the UNK between god and UNK brings on the destiny of UNK but UNK UNK his role UNK STOP 
START the third act of UNK 2 is a formal celebration of the union between the UNK and the classic between the spirit of UNK and that of romantic drama STOP 
START the UNK of UNK love for helen of UNK goes back to the sources of the UNK legend STOP 
START it tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest wisdom joined to the highest UNK beauty STOP 
START there can be no greater magic than to UNK from death her in whom the flesh was all in whom beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely UNK STOP 
START it is thus that the brightness of helen passes through UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK used the UNK to more elaborate ends STOP 
START UNK UNK helen from UNK UNK is the genius of renaissance europe UNK to life the classic tradition STOP 
START the UNK change from the palace at UNK to UNK UNK UNK UNK us to the aesthetic meaning of the myth the translation of antique drama into UNK and romantic UNK STOP 
START this translation or rather the fusion of the two ideals creates the UNK the total art form STOP

START probably the UNK thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week STOP 
START for many reasons the demand to buy shares in the UNK company was tremendous STOP 
START it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock was more one of UNK a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell STOP 
START investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many STOP 
START in fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than 100 shares STOP 
START some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of their customers STOP 
START a measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began STOP 
START the stock was sold in the UNK at a price of UNK a share STOP 
START the first UNK trade wednesday afternoon at UNK UNK UNK the UNK UNK was at UNK a share STOP 
START and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around UNK a share STOP 
START but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market STOP 
START indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started UNK in dallas last january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up STOP 
START letters by the UNK came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold UNK to the public at UNK with another UNK reserved for morton foods employes at UNK a share STOP 
START there was even a UNK in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering STOP 
START we UNK 500 shares of morton foods of texas STOP 
START UNK UNK it said translated STOP 
START but UNK could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares STOP 
START after it UNK shares to 41 UNK and UNK selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone STOP 
START but the result of it all was UNK partner dean UNK believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation STOP 
START i feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country STOP 
START he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do STOP 
START but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one answer is that it was a combination of circumstances STOP 
START first the general stock market has been UNK upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up STOP 
START as a result it is not easy to find a stock UNK as the morton issue was UNK at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the UNK anticipated UNK STOP 
START second the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks UNK and h. w. lay on the market STOP 
START both of those have had dynamic UNK in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher UNK and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast UNK STOP 
START and third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late STOP 
START foods which long had been considered UNK UNK but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going to higher UNK ratios STOP 
START the potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger STOP 
START the history of the u.s. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days STOP 
START those that remain are those that were headed by strong UNK men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the UNK STOP 
START but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no UNK management in their firms STOP 
START so they go looking for UNK with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like UNK STOP 
START all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is STOP 
START now if UNK newest product a corn chip known as UNK turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the UNK UNK bid it up to STOP 
START dallas and north texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies valued in the millions of dollars STOP

START it is no coincidence that the texas cotton UNK association is meeting here this week for the UNK time in their UNK history STOP 
START the exhibition of cotton UNK machinery at the state fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars STOP 
START it UNK in the tons so the UNK of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year STOP

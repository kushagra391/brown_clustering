START UNK older workers who have no expectation of UNK employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure UNK and UNK in an occupation with a future STOP 
START some vocational training schools provide such training but the current need UNK the facilities STOP 
START current programs the present federal program of vocational education began in UNK with the passage of the UNK act which provided a continuing annual UNK of UNK million to support on a matching basis UNK programs of vocational education in agriculture UNK industrial skills and home economics STOP 
START since UNK some thirteen UNK and related acts have extended this federal program STOP 
START the UNK act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual UNK to UNK million in addition to the UNK million under the smith act STOP 
START the health amendment act of 1956 added UNK million for practical nurse training STOP 
START the latest major change in this program was introduced by the national defense education act of 1958 title 8 of which amended the UNK act STOP 
START annual UNK of UNK million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians STOP 
START the federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools STOP 
START the initiative administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts STOP 
START even the states remain primarily in an UNK role providing leadership and teacher training STOP 
START federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the state or local districts must pay at least half STOP 
START the state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it STOP 
START throughout the history of the program state government expenditures in the UNK have usually matched or UNK the federal expenditures while local districts all together have spent more than either federal or state governments STOP 
START today federal funds account for only UNK of the nation's expenditures for vocational education STOP 
START the greatest impact of the UNK principle has been in initially encouraging the UNK states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds STOP 
START national defense considerations have been the major reason behind most federal training expenditures in recent decades STOP 
START during world war 2 about UNK million persons were UNK in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities 1 vocational education for national defense and 2 war production training STOP 
START the total cost of the UNK program was UNK million STOP 
START for the UNK UNK and national defense act of 1958 the cumulative total of federal expenditures in 42 years was only about UNK million STOP 
START no comparable measures are available of UNK and expenditures for private vocational education training STOP 
START there are a great number and variety of private commercial schools trade schools and technical schools STOP 
START in addition many large corporations operate their own formal training programs STOP 
START a recent study indicated that UNK per cent of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and UNK STOP 
START most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions STOP 
START the national manpower council of columbia university has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained STOP 
START there is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education STOP 
START employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training STOP 
START vocational UNK do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers but it provides the essential UNK for developing skills STOP 
START in most states trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities STOP 
START in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses STOP 
START in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs and in pennsylvania 11 per cent STOP 
START an important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools STOP 
START for a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states have been building UNK vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties STOP 
START these schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts STOP 
START transportation may be provided from nearby school districts STOP 
START courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses also may be conducted STOP 
START the title 8 program of the national defense education act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools STOP 
START by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states STOP 
START they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas STOP 
START an extension of this program into the other UNK areas should be undertaken STOP 
START relation to new industry some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry STOP 
START the major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of UNK training for a large number of UNK machine operators STOP 
START a few key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere STOP 
START a prospective industry also may be interested in the UNK advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide UNK extension courses for its employees STOP 
START the existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled STOP 
START additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff and program are in being STOP 
START thus besides the training provided to youth in school the existence of the school program can have UNK benefits to industry which make it an UNK to industrial development efforts STOP 
START few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of UNK new industry STOP 
START the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad UNK flexible basis to UNK any local UNK training programs that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant STOP 
START local focus of programs the major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands STOP 
START this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country STOP 
START planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers STOP 
START all the UNK for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs of UNK the growth of local jobs and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content STOP 
START furthermore there is a UNK UNK on the part of those making local skill surveys STOP 
START local jobs can be seen and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more UNK STOP 
START while the u. s. department of labor has a program of UNK industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence that these UNK have been used UNK in local curriculum planning STOP 
START the u. s. office of education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys STOP 
START this procedure is extremely UNK in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of UNK employment STOP 
START elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job UNK and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills STOP 
START no effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained STOP 
START moreover the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and UNK STOP 
START there simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable STOP 
START much of the available information comes not from the federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states STOP 
START proposals state and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities STOP 
START there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs STOP 
START a related question is whether UNK workers can be UNK to take the training provided STOP 
START there is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to UNK in their programs even though they must pay UNK receive no UNK payments and are not guaranteed a job STOP 
START however there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training STOP 
START again one major difficulty is the local focus STOP 
START a training program in a depressed area may have few UNK unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community STOP 
START if there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be expected to respond STOP 
START another problem is who will pay for the training STOP 
START local school districts are hard pressed UNK and UNK about vocational training STOP 
START programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it STOP 
START even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it STOP 
START state governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities STOP 
START only the federal government is likely to be able to take a UNK and UNK view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs STOP 
START if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states STOP 
START however if federal funds are used it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment STOP 
START such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other UNK STOP 
START a further possibility is suggested by the example of the g. i. bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate STOP 
START this probably would require some support for UNK as well as for UNK but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth conservation corps STOP 
START a maximum of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home STOP 
START a program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor STOP 
START instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training STOP 
START such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located STOP 
START this would UNK possibilities for part-time cooperative UNK and extension training STOP 
START personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual STOP 
START his UNK and UNK could be given more weight in selecting the proper training STOP

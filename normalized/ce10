START the average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun we ran a survey to find out but he's always on the UNK for new and better arms STOP 
START he's more than a reader of outdoor articles a real hunter and UNK eager to improve his sport STOP 
START well if you're that kind of UNK we're here to help you STOP 
START you've probably given a lot of UNK thought to the guns in your UNK but it's not easy to decide on a new one STOP 
START you still have time to drop a few UNK about the gifts you'd appreciate most time to decide on them is now STOP 
START as a christmas service i've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models STOP 
START here they are with my comments and judgments STOP 
START read on take your pick and start dropping those UNK STOP 
START first on my own list would be two arms a rifle and a UNK that qualify as new in the UNK sense STOP 
START for me a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design STOP 
START such UNK are all for the best but it takes something as different as a UNK or a jet to change UNK concepts STOP 
START bill UNK UNK UNK under UNK is a new rifle action in a UNK that UNK all the modern theory of UNK fans a short light UNK UNK little timber gun designed to push a heavy UNK at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game UNK STOP 
START UNK reports that on his recent african UNK the little magnum UNK was a real work horse STOP 
START small UNK were generally UNK with one shot and the magnum UNK also UNK UNK UNK and wart UNK with deadly efficiency are fairly large tough animals STOP 
START the UNK of the magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me STOP 
START at least five years ago tom robinson of UNK made up an over double rifle for me in this UNK using the now UNK model 90 action in UNK size STOP 
START after UNK out how to UNK the UNK so that they shot to the same point of impact we fired this little UNK job on my home range and in UNK underground test gallery STOP 
START we quickly ran into the same trouble that UNK bill UNK in his first experiments three or four bullets would be placed well in a UNK bull at 100 yards and then UNK one could stray far out of the group STOP 
START UNK learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was UNK the shape of the UNK revolver bullet STOP 
START the new UNK UNK in magnum UNK this STOP 
START but even without UNK bullets i had enough faith in my double to take it on an UNK deer UNK that first year STOP 
START within half an hour i jumped a UNK buck that UNK through a UNK UNK and i caught him just behind the left UNK at 60 yards STOP 
START he moved only about 30 feet after the UNK UNK hit him and this was after the bullet had passed through a UNK STOP 
START three more deer have fallen to this same gun and all were UNK UNK STOP 
START my double was made with UNK revolver UNK before cutting to revolver length and although it UNK well in other respects it's considerably heavier than the UNK which only UNK about UNK pounds STOP 
START if ever a rifle met the needs of the UNK hunter this is it STOP 
START the UNK points with the ease speed and precision of a fine UNK double UNK and its trigger pull is light and sharp STOP 
START the UNK bullet leaves the UNK at UNK UNK which gives it all the UNK needed at woods UNK STOP 
START with five shots at the immediate command of the UNK trigger finger the gun and load are a deadly combination STOP 
START the second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of UNK load the UNK jet magnum center fire STOP 
START at present it's available in one model the fine and familiar smith UNK magnum revolver about UNK long a UNK UNK among target arms STOP 
START the velocity of this UNK bullet is UNK at a very hot UNK UNK and it's the UNK shooting of any revolver UNK with a UNK rise of about an inch over a UNK range STOP 
START this is a UNK load pure and simple much too explosive for small UNK game STOP 
START it can cut a red UNK neatly in two or burst a UNK into a UNK of feathers STOP 
START the most UNK aspect of the s UNK magnum UNK for the new jet is that it can also fire standard UNK by means of UNK UNK in the chambers STOP 
START you may therefore convert the gun into a UNK and UNK arm although the difference in the point of impact jet vs. UNK can be somewhat UNK STOP 
START the accuracy of the jet UNK is fine tested it in my UNK s UNK and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if i did my part by holding the UNK steadily STOP 
START hunting rifles UNK the fact that the UNK and the jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models actions and UNK STOP 
START aside from the UNK UNK a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time STOP 
START here are the UNK in UNK order and the new models STOP 
START UNK to the american hunter are the UNK group of UNK UNK rifles STOP 
START they have fine UNK actions and a UNK finish on both the metal and the stock wood STOP 
START barrel weights vary UNK with the various UNK available and these include the standard UNK about UNK plus the UNK around UNK latter include the s h and STOP 
START UNK rubber UNK UNK are standard on all of the UNK except the STOP 
START stock designs are excellent for use with UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK 1961 rifles are all made with UNK actions regardless of UNK STOP 
START the have the short action and the medium action and the af and the UNK the long action about UNK for the standard UNK and UNK for the custom version STOP 
START previously UNK actions were used for the larger UNK STOP 
START high standard has introduced a auto the UNK in two grades field and special less than UNK and just over UNK respectively STOP 
START it's a UNK rifle fast and UNK STOP 
START among magnum UNK rifles UNK UNK UNK was the UNK model UNK UNK around UNK STOP 
START previously known as jefferson arms UNK has given this UNK UNK job an UNK fine stock design and the UNK is the first UNK to handle magnum UNK STOP 
START UNK has made two contributions to the harvest of new UNK STOP 
START the model UNK under UNK is a UNK UNK UNK auto with a UNK magazine that holds 18 long rifles STOP 
START it's extremely accurate for an auto and the test rifle i tried was completely UNK in functioning STOP 
START the UNK about UNK is an even newer auto this one with a UNK or UNK UNK STOP 
START once again the UNK UNK outfit has appeared but this time as a UNK UNK combination STOP 
START the bore is UNK but is provided with an insert tube which is UNK and which surprisingly gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only UNK inches long STOP 
START you can UNK this tube and replace it with a UNK insert for use with UNK to break the little UNK clay targets STOP 
START a trap for throwing these UNK UNK UNK to the barrel so that the UNK can throw his own targets STOP 
START a spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available STOP 
START you can have your choice of a UNK UNK the UNK about UNK or a UNK the UNK UNK less STOP 
START the UNK is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic UNK practice but it's UNK than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds STOP 
START they'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the UNK mark STOP 
START the combination of thin pattern and very tiny UNK makes it necessary to get on the birds right now magnum UNK appeared in the UNK line for 1961 with the addition of the and to the list of model UNK STOP 
START these are made on special order only in UNK grade about UNK with integral UNK UNK and heavy rubber UNK UNK UNK around nine pounds STOP 
START a UNK version of the highly regarded UNK UNK UNK also appeared in 1961 STOP 
START this UNK under UNK about UNK more for a UNK grade has an UNK barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's model UNK pump with a UNK STOP 
START this design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle UNK STOP 
START presently the UNK is available in af STOP 
START the latest UNK of the famous savage model UNK are the UNK UNK about UNK and the UNK UNK under UNK which have a UNK safety and improved trigger design STOP 
START the replacement of the UNK side safety catch will make this UNK favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate STOP 
START UNK guns UNK a fresh crop of UNK guns showed up in 1961 and they're good UNK for your christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a UNK STOP 
START the most unusual of them is the UNK UNK about UNK UNK for a saddle UNK a UNK UNK UNK after the famous winchester UNK and UNK the western look STOP 
START because of its traditional lines it probably has more kid appeal than any other model STOP 
START the action is a UNK handling all the standard UNK STOP 
START UNK latest is also designed for the beginning UNK although it's a UNK rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock STOP 
START this is the model UNK about UNK a UNK UNK with an automatic safety i.e. the safety goes on every time the UNK is lifted and the gun UNK for the next shot STOP 
START stock design is excellent and this model is a good first gun STOP 
START another boy's model is the UNK UNK UNK around UNK which comes with a UNK barrel and a short UNK stock just right for a boy of UNK STOP 
START a UNK UNK has also been introduced this year STOP 
START the UNK stevens UNK under UNK is made with a side lever rather than a UNK lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top UNK to open a gun and the side lever does indeed open very easily STOP 
START this gun has a UNK stock and is available in either 20 or gauge STOP 
START there's another addition to the stevens line the UNK model UNK in under UNK which you may or may not consider a kid's gun experienced UNK like this gauge and type of UNK too STOP 
START UNK UNK although there were no startling developments in UNK design this year a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market STOP 
START for example a UNK trap version of the UNK over the broadway from UNK up depending on grade UNK from standard models in that it is equipped with a full UNK UNK end a UNK UNK UNK and a UNK UNK UNK for fast UNK STOP 
START the colt line now includes a new UNK the standard or custom pump model about UNK and UNK respectively in 12 16 and 20 STOP 
START UNK international has introduced another import this one from UNK STOP 
START it's the UNK about UNK a UNK over very much like the old UNK 32 which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices STOP 
START high standard has also added two models to its line STOP 
START the UNK UNK prices begin at less than UNK and depend on grade and UNK features is a UNK auto STOP 
START the UNK UNK beginning at just over UNK is a pump gun in 12 or 16 STOP 
START either model is a very good dollar value STOP 
START UNK latest contribution to the field is the model 500 from UNK is an improved version of the old model 200 a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START see page 24 for a complete report on it STOP 
START UNK UNK aside from the jet which i coupled with the UNK UNK as one of the year's two biggest developments few significant UNK appeared among UNK UNK STOP

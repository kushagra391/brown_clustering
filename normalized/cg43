START two UNK of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for our time STOP 
START one a UNK on the point i have just made is the phenomenon of UNK UNK and UNK which fromm discussed in the escape from freedom STOP 
START in essence this involves UNK one's thought and emotion in the values and experience of others rather than in one's own values and experience STOP 
START there is a risk that instead of teaching a person how to be himself reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody else STOP 
START clearly what the person brings to the reading is important STOP 
START moreover if the critic UNK his audience in what to see in a work he is contributing to this UNK he UNK them in how to evaluate a work he is helping them to achieve their own identity STOP 
START the second UNK part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity has to do with the difference between good and UNK literary works and the UNK mass culture products of today STOP 
START in the range and variety of characters who in their literary lives get along all right with life styles one never imagined possible there is an implicit lesson in UNK STOP 
START the reader observing this process might ask why not be different find in the answer a license to be a UNK of the human species STOP 
START the observer of television or other products for a mass audience has only a permit to be like the models he sees even more like everybody else STOP 
START and this i think holds for values as well as life styles STOP 
START one would need to test this proposition carefully all the large and probably UNK UNK UNK literature on the most UNK character i ever met deals with village UNK country doctors favorite if UNK UNK and so forth STOP 
START scientists often turn out to be UNK too STOP 
START but still the proposition is worth examination STOP 
START it is possible that the study of literature affects the conscience the morality the sensitivity to some code of right and wrong STOP 
START i do not know that this is true UNK and UNK west deal with the development and nature of conscience as do such UNK as UNK and UNK STOP 
START it forms the core of many perhaps most problems of UNK STOP 
START i am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the UNK profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience most of their attention is to a UNK period of life or for the UNK of course to the influence of religion STOP 
START still it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong the UNK alarm over the UNK books and the continuous concern over UNK literature indicate some UNK aspects of this influence STOP 
START probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development of conscience which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature but the contents of conscience the code which is UNK to the developed or UNK conscience available STOP 
START this is in large part a code of behavior and a UNK of values what is it that people do and should do and how one should regard it STOP 
START in a small way this is illustrated by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover how to behave how to think about this new experience how to exercise restraint STOP 
START literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose dedication mission significance STOP 
START this no doubt is part of what UNK UNK implies when he says of the arts they give form and meaning to life which might otherwise seem UNK and without sense STOP 
START men seem almost UNK to want a sense of function that is a feeling that their existence makes a difference to someone living or UNK close and immediate or UNK STOP 
START feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation STOP 
START a need so deeply planted asking for direction so to speak is likely to be UNK by the vivid examples and heroic proportions of literature STOP 
START the terms UNK and UNK which often come up in aesthetic discussion seem partly to derive their import from the UNK of purpose and a UNK sense of significance a person may receive from poetry drama and fiction STOP 
START the notion of UNK is somehow UNK to this feeling STOP 
START how literature does this or for whom is certainly not clear but the content form and language of the message as well as the source would all play UNK parts in giving and molding a sense of purpose STOP 
START one of the most UNK features of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and organization of emotion STOP 
START let us UNK a few of these ideas STOP 
START the UNK notion of UNK the UNK of emotion is a persistent and UNK one STOP 
START the idea here is one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view plato's notion of the UNK of emotion STOP 
START a third idea is that artistic literature serves to reduce emotional UNK giving a sense of UNK and calm to individuals STOP 
START this is given some expression in UNK notion of harmony and the resolution of UNK STOP 
START a fourth view is the transformation of emotion as in UNK fine phrase on the arts they UNK and UNK our inner nature STOP 
START it is possible that the idea of UNK of emotion is a fifth idea STOP 
START UNK UNK in his discussion of the functions and future of poetry suggests this one of the things which makes our lives UNK and empty and which leaves us at the end of the day UNK and UNK UNK is the pressure of the UNK practical UNK concern of UNK objects STOP 
START if art is to release us from these UNK things things we must think UNK about and bring us back to the UNK beauty and UNK of the aesthetic component of reality in its UNK it must UNK its connection with these common sense entities STOP 
START i take the central meaning here to be the contrast between the UNK empty quality of life without literature and a life UNK by it STOP 
START UNK view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety for him it constitutes in part the organization of impulses STOP 
START a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these STOP 
START but there is one in particular which it seems to me deserves special attention STOP 
START in the wide range of experiences common to our UNK race none is more difficult to manage more UNK and more UNK in its effects than the control of love and hate STOP 
START the study of literature UNK to this control in a curious way STOP 
START william UNK and UNK brooks it seems to me have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected for if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love and yet not aim at exciting UNK emotion or even an emotion of UNK UNK and if it is to talk of anger and murder and yet not aim at UNK anger and UNK then it may be that the poetic way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of UNK UNK or UNK or any direct assault upon the UNK at all STOP 
START something indirect mixed UNK UNK might well be the UNK the UNK technique by which a poet UNK in all kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like expressions of these emotions without UNK at their UNK or even UNK anything that essentially involves their UNK STOP 
START the UNK through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions may be a most valuable human experience STOP 
START here i do not mean UNK the discharge of emotion STOP 
START i mean something more like UNK concept of the utility of play to a small child he plays house or doctor or UNK as a way of UNK slightly frightening experiences UNK them UNK until they are under control STOP 
START there is a second feature of the influences of literature good literature on emotional life which may have some special value for our time STOP 
START in b. m. UNK UNK of the UNK and UNK youth of london a UNK finding was the inability to UNK UNK a need to satisfy impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of UNK the experience STOP 
START perhaps it is only an analogy but one of the most obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an UNK quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation STOP 
START anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean STOP 
START it is at least possible that the capacity to UNK UNK is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure to great literature STOP 
START in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions particularly with respect to the sense of harmony or relief of tension or sense of a transformed inner nature which may occur a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produces the effect would be required STOP 
START in the calm which follows the reading of a poem for example is the effect produced by the enforced quiet by the musical quality of words and rhythm by the UNK or sense of the poem by the associations with earlier readings if it is familiar by the boost to the UNK for the UNK by the UNK of attention by the sense of security in a UNK UNK by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded as forbidden or by UNK ideas about the magical power of words are if the research is done with UNK and skill UNK UNK but the research is missing STOP 
START one of the most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of UNK that it is thought to provide STOP 
START UNK is a vague word covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent quality or skill STOP 
START among other things it means perception discrimination sensitivity to subtle differences STOP 
START both the extent to which this is true and the limits of the field of UNK skill involved should be acknowledged STOP 
START its truth is illustrated by the skill sensitivity and general UNK of the english professor with whom one UNK the theatre STOP 
START the limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment contrast the UNK skill of english professors with that of their colleagues in UNK among motor cars political candidates or female beauty STOP 
START along these lines the particular point that sensitivity in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more proof than i have seen STOP 
START in a UNK and general exploration of the field of personal perception and UNK behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject with one possible exception UNK shows the UNK stability of UNK based on sensation hot sweet bitter etc. dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events STOP 
START but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to UNK and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an UNK leap STOP 
START i would say too that the study of literature tends to give a person what i shall call depth STOP 
START i use this term to mean three things a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs a tendency to look at UNK rather than parts and a tendency to respond to these events and UNK with feeling STOP 
START it is the UNK of UNK UNK emotional UNK STOP 
START i think these attributes cluster but i have no evidence STOP 
START in fact i can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide continuous and properly guided exposure to literary art STOP

START UNK UNK tests one of the UNK realities of the cold war is that it has thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral UNK STOP 
START the first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself STOP 
START that dilemma is as much with us as ever STOP 
START the second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet tests STOP 
START when this second dilemma first became obvious during the UNK to late UNK the united states appeared to have three choices STOP 
START it could have UNK abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations STOP 
START it could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of communist world domination STOP 
START or it could have chosen to find by UNK some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security STOP 
START this third choice was in fact made STOP 
START with the UNK of soviet testing and their UNK at the geneva talks however the hope that this third choice would prove UNK has been shaken STOP 
START once again the united states must choose STOP 
START and once again the choices are much the same STOP 
START only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder STOP 
START the first choice UNK tests entirely would not only be UNK UNK but would surely be UNK by the russians STOP 
START the second choice full testing has become even more UNK just because the current soviet tests have already UNK UNK the atmosphere STOP 
START the third choice UNK UNK as russian behavior UNK a great deal of UNK thinking to make it appear reasonable STOP 
START we take the position however that the third choice still remains the only UNK one open to us STOP 
START it is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable STOP 
START its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice which should it fail will not have UNK the conscience STOP 
START that is the UNK we most fear STOP 
START leaving aside the choice of UNK UNK of tests as neither UNK nor clearly moral the question must arise as to why UNK of UNK tests on our part would not be a good choice STOP 
START for that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent americans are now UNK STOP 
START in particular governor nelson rockefeller has expressed as UNK and clearly as anyone the case for a UNK of UNK tests STOP 
START speaking recently in miami governor rockefeller said that to assure the UNK of our own weapons in the face of the recent soviet tests we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests STOP 
START taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be UNK in world opinion he argued that the responsibility of the united states is to do UNK and firmly not what is popular but what is right STOP 
START what was missing in the governor's argument as in so many similar arguments was a UNK which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be UNK desirable to what is right STOP 
START the possibility as he asserted that the russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical UNK unless of course we have UNK become so UNK that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand STOP 
START besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor's case one can ask seriously whether our lead over the russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary STOP 
START recent statements by the president and defense department spokesmen have to the contrary assured us that our lead is very great STOP 
START unless the administration and the defense department have been UNK us the facts do not support the UNK that we are compelled to resume UNK testing STOP 
START it is perfectly conceivable that a UNK of UNK tests may at some point in the future be necessary and even UNK STOP 
START but a UNK does not seem UNK now STOP 
START what we need to realize is that the increasingly great UNK of the atmosphere by the soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations STOP 
START we now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake STOP 
START this is an ethical demand which cannot be UNK or UNK over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism STOP 
START too often in the past russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part STOP 
START there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia does STOP 
START the refusal to resume UNK testing would be a good start STOP 
START ecumenical hopes when his UNK pope john 23 first called for an ecumenical council and at the same time UNK his UNK for christian unity the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant UNK was immediate STOP 
START with good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided UNK STOP 
START but as the more concrete plans for the work of the council gradually became known there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides STOP 
START the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the church STOP 
START as it has turned out however the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses STOP 
START two things have happened in recent months to bring the council into perspective each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy STOP 
START first of all it is now known that pope john sees the UNK and UNK of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity STOP 
START far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task the UNK believes that a UNK church is required in order that the whole world may see UNK in the best possible light STOP 
START equally significant pope john has said that catholics themselves bear some responsibility for christian UNK STOP 
START a major aim of the council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the church today stands in the way of unity STOP 
START UNK a whole series of addresses and actions by the pope and by others show that concern for christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the church STOP 
START the establishment by the holy father of a permanent UNK for christian unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern STOP 
START the UNK of five catholic UNK to attend the world council of churches assembly in new UNK as official observers UNK the UNK earlier stand STOP 
START the public appeal by the new UNK secretary of state cardinal UNK for renewed efforts toward eastern and western reunion was still another remarkable act STOP 
START nor can one forget pope john's unprecedented meeting with the UNK of UNK STOP 
START UNK cardinal UNK the director of the UNK for christian unity has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that UNK the UNK UNK toward the protestant and orthodox churches STOP 
START noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion he has said that they ought not to UNK anyone STOP 
START for UNK or the temptation to abandon our efforts would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the UNK of god the UNK UNK of prayer the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit STOP 
START can any christian fail to respond to these words budget deficit the UNK official budget review which estimates a UNK billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year isn't making anyone happy STOP 
START certainly it isn't making the president happy and he has been doing his UNK best to explain how the budget got into its UNK condition how he UNK to UNK wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year STOP 
START we UNK with mr. kennedy but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn't please us either although for very different reasons STOP 
START furthermore we find his defense of the UNK budget more UNK than UNK STOP 
START in the first place a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the UNK president's farewell gift of a political UNK to his successor STOP 
START the eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet UNK in its UNK of revenue to be received STOP 
START the rest of the deficit is also easily understood STOP 
START four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense an expenditure necessitated by the UNK policies of the UNK administration quite apart from the recent crises in berlin and elsewhere STOP 
START four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program a responsibility similarly neglected by mr. eisenhower STOP 
START the farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion because of unusual weather factors the food for peace program and other new measures STOP 
START UNK programs aid for the UNK their children and for depressed areas account for only UNK million of the UNK billion dollar deficit STOP 
START our complaint is that in many crucial areas the kennedy programs are not too large but too small most seriously in regard to the conventional arms UNK and in aid and welfare measures STOP 
START and yet mr. kennedy UNK in trying to UNK the UNK of the right with UNK and promises of UNK up and UNK STOP 
START we wish the president would remember that fiscal responsibility was the UNK of the party that lost the election STOP 
START the party that won used to say something about a new frontier STOP 
START ethics and peace introduction of the dialogue principle proved UNK effective at the UNK annual meeting of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october STOP 
START two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent protestants and when the speaker was a catholic one UNK on the UNK tended to be of another religious UNK STOP 
START several effects were immediately evident STOP 
START sessions devoted to ethics and foreign policy trends moral principle and political judgment christian ethics in the cold war and related subjects proved to be much UNK under this procedure than if catholics were merely talking to themselves STOP 
START usually questions from the floor were directed to the UNK speaker or discussion leader STOP 
START in the earlier sessions there was UNK discussion on the natural law which dr. william v. UNK of UNK university advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy STOP 
START that UNK principle experienced a thorough UNK from a number of the UNK but in the end the concept came to UNK itself STOP 
START speakers declared that protestants often make use of it if perhaps by some other name STOP 
START a UNK UNK told about its existence and application in the UNK tradition as the divine law while a UNK member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new u.n. nations told of its widespread recognition on the african continent STOP 
START the impression was UNK that whatever one may choose to call it natural law is a functioning UNK with a certain objective existence STOP 
START another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself STOP 
START the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was UNK STOP 
START it was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each UNK positions and better UNK of one's own STOP 
START but a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to UNK acceptable solutions of urgent political issues STOP 
START one effect of the UNK UNK of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts knowledge of the destructive force of even the UNK UNK atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the UNK of its use to defend berlin for example UNK influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the christian UNK STOP

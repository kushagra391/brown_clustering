START they would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a UNK in paris or hong kong at the UNK expense STOP 
START they would be particularly UNK with the state department if it were the source of such reports STOP 
START few things are more UNK for the state department than a UNK congressman STOP 
START the reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why state UNK so much of its diplomatic energy on congress when the russians are so available STOP 
START first the state department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public UNK STOP 
START the farmers may be aroused if congress cuts into the agriculture department's budget STOP 
START businessmen will rise if congress attacks the commerce department STOP 
START labor UNK undue brutality toward the labor department chamber of commerce UNK upon the treasury STOP

START UNK with the post office may UNK every UNK who can write STOP 
START with all these agencies the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his UNK accordingly STOP 
START no such political restraint UNK his blood when he UNK upon the state department in anger STOP

START and are not the state department men who UNK this UNK merely UNK and UNK who have never met a payroll not the UNK congressman be UNK at the UNK if he UNK them to get right with america and if he UNK the taxpayer some money by UNK a few of their UNK chances are excellent that he will STOP 
START the result is that the state department's UNK position before congress is the UNK pose of the UNK boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a UNK UNK with his wife STOP 
START people in this position do not UNK the master by relating his UNK to the newspapers STOP 
START state keeps the UNK list a secret STOP 
START the department expects and receives no thanks from congress for its discretion STOP 
START congress is a harsh master STOP 
START state is expected to UNK the UNK UNK foreign UNK UNK are expected to supply him with UNK of local money to pay his way workers are expected to entertain him according to his UNK frequently with their savings for the children's college UNK STOP 
START but come the next session of congress state can expect only that its summer guest will UNK its hand when it goes to the capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its UNK STOP 
START the congressman who in paris may have UNK his UNK with enough UNK notes to paper the roof of UNK will UNK scream that a UNK increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is UNK to UNK of the treasury STOP 
START in the matter of money state's most UNK UNK during the eisenhower years was representative john j. UNK of brooklyn who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses STOP

START UNK remained UNK STOP 
START the trouble explained UNK UNK then deputy UNK for administration is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing it always turns out that UNK knows more about our budget than we do STOP 
START one year the department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income STOP 
START news of the project reached the press STOP 
START next day reports went through the department that UNK had been UNK by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had UNK an UNK that that year expense allowances would not rise a dollar STOP 
START they didn't STOP 
START the department's constant fight with the house for money is a UNK UNK compared with its UNK UNK UNK with the senate STOP 
START armed with constitutional power to UNK the UNK foreign policy the senate carries a big stick and is easily UNK to use it on the state department's back or on the head of the secretary of state STOP 
START with its power to investigate the senate can UNK the secretary by keeping him in a state of UNK testimony before committees as it did with dean UNK STOP 
START john foster UNK escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because UNK johnson who was then operating the senate refused to let it become an UNK STOP 
START during UNK first two years in office while republicans ran the senate the department was at the mercy of men who had UNK for its blood since 1945 STOP 
START an internal police operation managed by scott UNK a former UNK man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence was part of the UNK STOP

START where UNK had fought a UNK losing battle for the department UNK fed the UNK with his UNK STOP 
START UNK privately but UNK public defense of his UNK UNK UNK remained UNK and detached while the UNK men had their way STOP 
START in view of eisenhower's UNK to UNK that anything was UNK in the terror it is doubtful that heroic intervention by UNK could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy STOP 
START in any event the example of UNK UNK by the senate did not encourage UNK to UNK it STOP 
START he elected to get along STOP 
START during this dark chapter in state department history men who had offered UNK ideas later proven wrong by events filled the UNK sent up to capitol hill STOP 
START their old errors of judgment were UNK in the curious logic of the time with present UNK intent STOP 
START their UNK UNK the lesson made it a point to have few ideas STOP 
START this in turn brought a new fashion in UNK criticism as the democrats took control STOP 
START in the new style the department was UNK as UNK UNK and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to UNK the russians STOP 
START for three or four years in the UNK this complaint was heard UNK up from the senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon STOP 
START it became smart to say that the fault was with UNK because he would not UNK thinking done by anyone but himself STOP 
START an equally UNK UNK is that the UNK of new thought was created by the UNK own UNK for UNK anyone whose ideas seem UNK to the next generation STOP

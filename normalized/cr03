START these are but a sampling of the UNK i endured STOP 
START as mrs. letch UNK was it any wonder that i once the social UNK of UNK was UNK from the smart UNK given by the UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK and such UNK closely UNK families as the UNK and the UNK UNK UNK conduct increased our invitations UNK and my heart was in my mouth whenever i played UNK at a fashionable UNK gathering STOP

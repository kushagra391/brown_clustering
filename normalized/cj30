START analysis analysis means the evaluation of UNK the comparative UNK of parts the UNK of the meaning of isolated elements STOP 
START analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts STOP 
START impersonal purposes up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms of individuals STOP 
START roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose to evaluate procedures regardless of individuals STOP 
START for example a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying STOP 
START examples let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation and analysis STOP 
START one should keep in mind that many of the exciting UNK of roleplaying are largely UNK and have not been used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other areas STOP 
START evaluation the president of a small firm selling restaurant products had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business STOP 
START UNK UNK references training the salesmen having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive and the rate of UNK due to UNK or UNK performance was too high STOP 
START it was his experience that only one good salesman was found out of every seven hired and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed STOP 
START roleplaying was offered as a solution and the procedure worked as follows all candidates were invited to a hotel conference room where the president explained the difficulty he had and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who just did not work out STOP 
START in place of asking salesmen to fill UNK UNK their references UNK them asking them to be tried out he told them he would prefer to test them STOP 
START each person was to enter the testing room carrying a suitcase of samples STOP 
START each salesman was to read a sheet containing a description of the product STOP 
START in the testing room he was to make UNK three UNK to three different people STOP 
START in the testing room three of the veteran salesmen served as UNK STOP 
START one handled the salesman in a friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a UNK manner STOP 
START each was told to purchase material if he felt like it STOP 
START the UNK came in one at a time and did not see or hear the other UNK STOP 
START after each presentation the UNK wrote his judgment of the salesmen so did the observers consisting of the president three of his salesmen and a UNK STOP 
START ten salesmen were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon STOP 
START this procedure was repeated one day a month for four months STOP 
START the batting average of one success out of seven increased to one out of three STOP 
START the president of the firm UNK expenses alone felt his costs had dropped UNK while success in selection had improved over one hundred per cent STOP 
START the reason for the value of this procedure was simply that the UNK were tested at work in different situations by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen conducted themselves with different but typical restaurant owners and managers STOP 
START they were in a sense tried out in realistic situations STOP 
START from the point of view of the UNK less time was wasted in being evaluated and they got a meal out of it as well as some insights into their performances STOP 
START another use of roleplaying for evaluation UNK how this procedure can be used in real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during the daily course of work STOP 
START the position of UNK was opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher prestige and slightly higher salary than UNK and UNK positions STOP 
START all UNK were generally familiar with the work of the UNK STOP 
START at the end of work one day the personnel man took the UNK one at a time asked them to sit behind the UNK desk and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to the UNK with a number of UNK and for a number of purposes STOP 
START each girl was independently tested by the personnel man and he served not only as the director but as the UNK and the observer STOP 
START somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat UNK and also had been in the office a relatively short time did the most outstanding job of playing the role of UNK showing wit UNK and UNK STOP 
START she was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day STOP 
START analysis in considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen in dynamic functioning STOP 
START some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure STOP 
START an engineer had been made the works manager of a firm UNK a retired employee who had been considered UNK successful STOP 
START the engineer had more than seven years of experience in the firm was well trained was considered a hard worker was respected by his fellow engineers for his technical competence and was regarded as a UNK STOP 
START however he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position STOP 
START he seemed to UNK everyone STOP 
START UNK rates of personnel went up production dropped and morale was UNK reduced STOP 
START despite the fact that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer he seemed to be a very poor administrator although no one quite knew what was wrong with him STOP 
START at the insistence of his own UNK the president of the firm he UNK in a course designed to develop leaders STOP 
START he played a number of typical situations before observers other UNK who kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong STOP 
START entirely concerned with efficiency he was UNK in UNK people who made mistakes UNK them to too great an extent STOP 
START he did not really listen to others had little interest in their ideas and wanted to have his own way which was the only right way STOP 
START the entire group of managers explained in great detail a number of human relations errors that he made STOP 
START one by one these errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors STOP 
START he admitted his behavior and defended it STOP 
START he refused to change his approach and instead he attacked high and low the officials for their not UNK him and UNK for their UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START after the UNK he left the course convinced that it could do him no good STOP 
START we may say that his problem was UNK but that he refused treatment STOP 
START the engineer turned works manager had a particular view of life and refused to change it STOP 
START we may say that his attitude was foolish since he may have been a success had he learned some human relations skills we may say that his attitude was UNK showing his independence of mind in his refusal to adjust to the opinions of others STOP 
START in any case he refused to accept the implications of the analysis that he needed to be made over STOP 
START another case may be given in illustration of a successful use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis STOP 
START in a course for UNK operators a district manager who had been recently appointed to his position after being UNK successful as a store manager found that in UNK other managers he was having a difficult time STOP 
START on playing some typical situations before a jury of his UNK he showed some characteristics UNK as UNK STOP 
START he was told he displayed for example a sense of superiority and he answered well i am supposed to know all the answers aren't i was criticized for his UNK and UNK and he answered i am not working to become popular STOP 
START on being criticized for his arbitrary behavior he answered i have to make decisions STOP 
START that's my job STOP 
START in short as frequently happens in analyses the individual feels threatened and UNK himself STOP 
START however in this case the district manager was led to see the errors of his ways STOP 
START the necessary step between diagnosis and training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms STOP 
START how this was accomplished may be described since this sometimes is a crucial problem STOP 
START the director helped UNK a check list of the district UNK errors by asking various observers to write out sentences UNK on the mistakes they felt he made STOP 
START these errors were then collected and written on a UNK UNK similar ideas STOP 
START eighteen errors were located and then the director asked each individual to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the particular errors STOP 
START they were asked to vote true if they thought they had seen him make the error false if they thought he had not cannot say if they were not certain STOP 
START the manager sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went up and the director wrote the numbers on the UNK STOP 
START no comments were made during the voting STOP 
START the results looked as follows af STOP 
START the first eight of these eighteen statements which received at least UNK of the votes were UNK to form an analysis UNK for the particular manager and when this particular manager UNK in other situations the members checked any items that appeared STOP 
START to prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions they were rather lengthy about twenty minutes the situations were UNK described to the manager so that he would not know what to expect new UNK were brought on the scene unexpectedly and the UNK were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in a manner for which he had been previously criticized STOP 
START after every session the check marks were UNK up and UNK and in this way the UNK progress was UNK STOP 
START summary in life we learn to play our roles and we UNK into patterns which become so UNK that we are not really aware of what we do STOP 
START we can see others more clearly than we can see ourselves and others can see us better than we see ourselves STOP 
START to learn what we do is the first step for improvement STOP 
START to accept the validity of the judgments of others is the second step STOP 
START to want to change is the third step STOP 
START to practice new procedures under guided supervision and with constant UNK is the fourth step STOP 
START to use these new ways in daily life is the last step STOP 
START roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to training STOP 
START when an UNK situation is set up and no concern is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate we say that roleplaying is used for evaluation STOP 
START observers can see a person engaged in spontaneous behavior and watch him operating in a UNK fashion STOP 
START this behavior is more UNK or true than other testing behavior for some types of evaluation and so can give quick and accurate estimates of complex functioning STOP 
START while roleplaying for testing is not too well understood at the present time it represents one of the major uses of this procedure STOP 
START chapter 10 UNK training the objective of this chapter is to clarify the distinctions between UNK theory and other training concepts STOP 
START in addition the basic approach UNK in applying roleplaying will be reviewed STOP 
START the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated UNK to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this unique training area STOP 
START the reasons for UNK this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of training are UNK STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START UNK training theory is unique and relatively new STOP

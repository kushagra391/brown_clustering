START george UNK account of relations between russia and the west from the fall of UNK to the end of world war 2 is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years STOP 
START it UNK qualities that are seldom found in one work UNK scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and UNK and a broad grasp of the UNK great historical issues STOP 
START in short the book based largely on lectures delivered at harvard university is both reliable and UNK author UNK an UNK fine english style and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly UNK for our time STOP 
START if mr. UNK is sometimes a little UNK in his UNK if his analysis of how western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social UNK is often critical and UNK well the record itself is not too encouraging STOP 
START mr. UNK takes careful account of every UNK circumstance in UNK the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken STOP 
START but he rejects perhaps a little too UNK the theory that UNK and UNK influences may have contributed to the policy of UNK stalin which UNK until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the yalta conference in february 1945 STOP 
START after all UNK UNK subsequently convicted of UNK in UNK that he gave secret state department documents to soviet agents was at yalta STOP 
START and harry UNK white UNK in UNK reports in communist associations was one of the UNK of the UNK plan which had it ever been put into full operation would have simply handed germany to stalin STOP 
START one item in this unhappy scheme was to have germany UNK exclusively by its continental neighbors among whom only the soviet union possessed real military strength STOP 
START it is quite probable however that UNK UNK and childish UNK to UNK like UNK surrender had more to do with the UNK UNK at the end of the war than UNK or sympathy with communism STOP 
START mr. UNK sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way UNK hope you see first of all and in a sense as the source of all other UNK the UNK american commitment to the principle of UNK surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the UNK power no matter what UNK or UNK this might involve for the more distant future STOP 
START UNK that there could have been no effective UNK peace with UNK he points out the UNK failure to give support to the UNK underground which very nearly eliminated UNK in 1944 STOP 
START a veteran UNK with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language history and literature UNK recalls how at the time of UNK attack on the soviet union in 1941 he UNK a private note to a state department official expressing the hope that never would we associate ourselves with russian purposes in the areas of eastern europe beyond her own boundaries STOP 
START the hope was UNK STOP 
START with justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an UNK body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement about the history of its diplomacy about what had happened in the UNK and about what had been going on in poland and the UNK states STOP 
START he also speaks of franklin d. UNK UNK assumption that if only he stalin could be exposed to the UNK charm of someone like UNK himself ideological UNK would UNK and russia's co-operation with the west could be easily arranged STOP 
START no wonder khrushchev's first message to president kennedy was a UNK desire for the return of the good old days of roosevelt STOP 
START this fascinating story begins with a sketch rich in personal detail of the UNK mutual impact of world war 1 and the two UNK of the russian revolution STOP 
START the first of these involved the replacement of the UNK by a liberal UNK government in march UNK second the UNK of power by the UNK who later called themselves communists in november of the same year STOP 
START as UNK shows the judgment of the allied governments about what was happening in russia was UNK by the UNK of UNK germany STOP 
START they were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fighting STOP 
START they attributed everything that went wrong in russia to german influence and UNK STOP 
START this more than any other factor led to the UNK of allied intervention STOP 
START as the author very UNK says had a world war not been in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the imagination have been an allied intervention in north russia STOP 
START the scope and significance of this intervention have been UNK exaggerated by communist propaganda UNK operating with precise facts and figures UNK an excellent job of UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK of many passages in the book that UNK the UNK vivid style the UNK of the two UNK UNK whose crimes make those of UNK UNK pale by comparison may be selected STOP 
START on stalin this was a man of incredible UNK of a UNK effectively without limits man apparently foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity man in whose UNK none was ever safe man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his UNK UNK in crime STOP 
START and here is UNK image of UNK UNK temporary UNK in the UNK and UNK of UNK peoples and his later enemy behind that charlie UNK UNK and that UNK lock of hair that always covered his forehead behind the UNK and the UNK UNK the passionate UNK and the occasional dull UNK stare behind the UNK the UNK the total UNK of behavior behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes there lay a statesman of no mean qualities UNK UNK in many ways realistic UNK like stalin with considerable powers of UNK capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired yet bold and UNK in his decisions and UNK one gift stalin did not possess the ability to UNK men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word STOP 
START two criticisms of this generally UNK and fascinating book involve the treatment of UNK diplomacy which is UNK at the edges there is no mention of the UNK conference or the UNK plan STOP 
START and in a UNK chapter about america's UNK in the contemporary world one senses certain UNK of emphasis and a failure to come to UNK with the UNK UNK of our time how to deal with a UNK and aggressive enemy without UNK and without war STOP 
START but one should not ask for everything STOP 
START mr. UNK who has recently abandoned UNK for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed american ambassador to UNK is not the only man who finds it easier to UNK the past than to UNK for the future STOP 
START the story of a quarter of a century of UNK relations is UNK important and it is told with the fire of a UNK historical narrator STOP 
START the ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic UNK UNK occasionally with UNK of native wit and charm STOP 
START in UNK there is quite a different UNK a rural land where singing dancing UNK and UNK are the thing STOP 
START there is plenty of violence to be sure but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed STOP 
START by and large robert UNK UNK of UNK UNK film the quiet man provides the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if not a UNK one STOP 
START this is the tale of one john UNK an american who has UNK killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man STOP 
START but UNK where UNK UNK UNK and her UNK brother will live is no place for a man who will not use his fists STOP 
START so UNK UNK of the UNK UNK is UNK considerably thereby providing the tale which is told STOP 
START you may be sure he UNK her in the end and has a fine old UNK fight with the brother and that there are plenty of minor UNK along the way to UNK that you understand what the word UNK means STOP 
START then there is a UNK one UNK UNK a role for which eddie UNK was happily selected STOP 
START now there is no reason in the world why a UNK in ireland should happen also to be a UNK UNK dancer and gifted UNK of movements of the UNK UNK and neck except that these talents add UNK to the enjoyment of the play STOP 
START mr. UNK is a joy having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect STOP 
START his UNK is naturally UNK and it only serves UNK right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to UNK STOP 
START art UNK a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice UNK UNK STOP 
START although he is not UNK with the UNK of romantic technique that's not what an UNK UNK is supposed to have anyway STOP 
START joan UNK a UNK UNK who can UNK you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not plays UNK and UNK the role very well too STOP 
START if the UNK which UNK exhibits has a bit of theatrical UNK in it never mind fits into the general scheme well enough STOP 
START susan johnson as the widow UNK the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the UNK death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one STOP 
START she has a good firm delivery of songs and UNK to the solid virtues of the evening STOP 
START then there are a pair of old UNK played by grace UNK and UNK UNK who may be right off the shelf of stock irish characters but they put such a combination of good will and UNK into their parts that they're quite entertaining STOP 
START and in the role of will UNK philip UNK UNK and UNK sufficiently to UNK not only one american but the whole british army if he chose STOP 
START UNK is no UNK but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing STOP 
START the UNK are sweet and sad and the music generally competent STOP 
START it sometimes UNK to UNK in the memory after the final curtain and some of it such as the UNK UNK i does STOP 
START a toast to the bride sung by UNK UNK playing a character called old man UNK is quite simple direct and touching STOP 
START the men of UNK are got up UNK in cloth UNK and UNK and their dancing and singing is fine STOP 
START so is that of the UNK company of UNK who UNK and UNK and UNK under jack UNK expert UNK direction STOP 
START the male dancers sometimes wear UNK and their performance in them is UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK in his stage UNK often uses the UNK curtain behind which mr. UNK has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow STOP 
START there is no reason why most UNK should not have a pretty good time at UNK unless they are permanently in the mood of UNK when he UNK about how easily he could hate the UNK irish STOP 
START we can all UNK more easily this morning more easily and UNK too because UNK UNK has turned the stage show UNK into a delightful and UNK film STOP 
START the task of taking the raw material of UNK UNK original UNK of french films about people of the UNK in UNK and putting them again on the screen after their passage through the broadway musical UNK was a delicate and UNK one indeed STOP 
START more than the fans of UNK old films and of their heroic star the great UNK were looking UNK at the project STOP 
START the fans of the musical were too STOP 
START but now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the UNK picture at the music hall yesterday STOP 
START whether fan of the UNK films or stage show whether partial to music or not you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart STOP

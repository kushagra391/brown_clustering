START she had done it last year and the year before and the year before that and she and her people were dependent upon these UNK for food STOP 
START this did not happen in counties of north georgia where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land STOP 
START nor in south georgia where the summer sun UNK UNK and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields STOP 
START this happened in UNK UNK county not 10 miles from the heart of UNK atlanta STOP 
START and now the woman tired and trembling came here to the UNK county cannery STOP 
START is it so the cannery is going to close n. UNK UNK tall grey as a UNK UNK plant chief since 1946 didn't know what to say STOP 
START he did say she could get her beef and vegetables in UNK this summer STOP 
START he did say he was out of UNK the no. UNK but i UNK UNK STOP 
START he said he had no. UNK enough to last two weeks more STOP 
START threat of closing the cannery is a recent one STOP 
START a UNK committee has recommended to commission chairman charles o. UNK that the UNK county cannery be closed STOP 
START reason the cannery loses UNK yearly STOP 
START but UNK citizens those who use the facilities of the cannery say the cannery is not supposed to make any money STOP 
START the cannery said mrs. UNK UNK an active UNK of the cannery since its opening during the war and UNK years of 1941 to handle the victory garden produce is a service to the taxpayer STOP 
START and one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat to plant grow vegetables and put them up STOP 
START it helps those people who help themselves STOP 
START the county though seems more interested in those people who don't even try those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food STOP 
START a driver of a dairy truck who begins work at 1 a.m. UNK before breakfast then goes out and grows a garden and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five asked what in the world will we do what in the world UNK others those come with the UNK potatoes the UNK will any of us do a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county doesn't believe it will close STOP 
START but he is in the middle an UNK of UNK but on the side of the people STOP 
START the young married people old couples STOP 
START the dairy truck driver old woman with the UNK STOP 
START don't ask me if i think the cannery helps he said STOP 
START sir i know the cannery helps STOP 
START most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard STOP 
START when a person has UNK or deliberately caused us pain or UNK it is not always easy to say just forget it STOP 
START there is one thing i know person will never have spiritual UNK and inner peace as long as the heart holds a UNK STOP 
START i know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades STOP 
START several years ago i was his pastor STOP 
START one night at the close of the evening service he came forward left his resentment at the UNK and gave his heart to god STOP 
START after almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land STOP 
START we tried to settle this dispute he said but could never come to an agreement STOP 
START i settled it tonight he continued STOP 
START i leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart i have left my UNK at the UNK and UNK my neighbor STOP 
START forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the kingdom of god STOP 
START you cannot wear the UNK of god and at the same time harbor UNK UNK and UNK in your heart STOP 
START henry van UNK said forgive and forget if you can forgive anyway STOP 
START jesus made three things clear about forgiveness STOP 
START we must first of all be willing to forgive others before we can secure god's forgiveness STOP 
START for if ye forgive men their UNK your UNK father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their UNK neither will your father forgive your UNK STOP 
START UNK 6 UNK STOP 
START it will do no good to seek god's forgiveness until we have UNK those who have done us wrong STOP 
START then jesus indicated that god's forgiveness is unlimited STOP 
START in the prayer jesus taught his UNK to pray we find these words forgive us our debts STOP 
START when a person meets god's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is UNK STOP 
START god's mercy and patience will last forever STOP 
START forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by god's love STOP 
START it also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past STOP 
START we want the past UNK but at the same time we must be willing for god to direct the future STOP 
START finally we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us STOP 
START once peter asked how UNK shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him seven times UNK unto him until UNK times seven STOP 
START UNK 18 UNK STOP 
START jesus not only taught forgiveness he gave us an example of it on the cross STOP 
START with all the energy of his broken body he prayed father forgive them for they know not what they do STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START she's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now although she's still a UNK who looks like a baby she is getting married STOP 
START her mother now dead was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring i had a UNK wish to say something meaningful to her something her mother would wish said STOP 
START for a while there was such UNK UNK UNK i couldn't have made myself heard if i'd had the equivalent of the message to UNK STOP 
START but when some of the UNK had UNK and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female six girls sprawled on one bed drinking UNK and UNK she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute STOP 
START how do you know you love somebody enough to get married asked STOP 
START it was the oldest and UNK question young UNK have ever asked how can you be sure aren't you sure asked looking at her UNK STOP 
START i wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait to consider to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important STOP 
START but if she were just having a normal case of UNK UNK such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage STOP 
START besides in all UNK i don't know how you can be sure STOP 
START i don't know any secret UNK for certainty STOP 
START in the UNK UNK UNK state of being in love the usual UNK that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes UNK STOP 
START i knew of but one test and i threw it out to her for what it was worth STOP 
START does he ever bore you asked STOP 
START bore me was shocked STOP 
START oh UNK he's so darling and i mean i went on UNK when he's not talking about you or himself or the UNK of love is he interesting he care about things that matter to you you UNK being UNK with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating honey i thought silently there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage long periods when you're UNK UNK together STOP 
START and if you bore each other then heaven help you STOP 
START she came back the other day to UNK me STOP 
START she has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be UNK UNK STOP 
START she asked if i had other advice and UNK with success i rushed it in i hope not too late STOP 
START be friends with your UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK to the contrary UNK make good friends STOP 
START i do not know dr. wilson UNK well STOP 
START but i was deeply moved by his letter of UNK as rector of st. UNK church in atlanta STOP 
START it was the cry of not just one heart spoke for many in the clergy i suspect STOP 
START the UNK is a lonely place STOP 
START who UNK to think of that the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this UNK church STOP 
START such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these UNK he told his members STOP 
START a minister should not stay beyond the time that his leadership should benefit his church he wrote for he becomes ordinary STOP 
START and so the young minister UNK to go and study and pray having never passed a day he told his UNK when i did not gain from you far more than i ever gave to you STOP 
START his very honest act called up the recent talk i had with another minister a modest methodist who said i feel so deeply blessed by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other men and i would have it no other way and it is UNK to think of self STOP 
START but oh how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest and peace in myself STOP 
START a man who gives himself to god and to the UNK of his church takes upon himself a life of giving STOP 
START he does not expect to get great UNK or he would not have chosen to answer the call to UNK STOP 
START the good ones are not UNK to seek UNK nor are they disposed to UNK comfort or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed UNK STOP 
START theirs is a UNK life by UNK standards STOP 
START yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul STOP 
START we press him to UNK to our comfortable UNK and not to UNK our UNK with his word and god's STOP 
START we do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty but we add to their burden while expecting them to UNK UNK upon us in return for UNK church attendance and a few UNK a week american cash STOP 
START if we break the minister to our bit we are buying back our own sins STOP 
START if he won't break we add to the stress he bears STOP 
START and a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man prone to the stresses that UNK humanity is UNK to STOP 
START we expect him to be noble and to make us so yet he knows and tries to tell us how very humble man must be STOP 
START we expect UNK of god's love through him STOP 
START but how little love we give him STOP 
START the church truly is not a rest home for UNK but a hospital for UNK STOP 
START yet every sunday we UNK go to that emergency room to receive first aid and we leave UNK that the man who UNK to us is a human being who UNK too STOP

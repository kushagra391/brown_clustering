START because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as UNK UNK UNK chemical treatment UNK refrigeration and freezing STOP 
START the basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between UNK or UNK to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption STOP 
START in earlier years the preservation of food was essentially related to survival STOP 
START in the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations UNK techniques have sought also to bring variety peak UNK and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the consumer STOP 
START with the development of nuclear technology UNK materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities of applying UNK radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout the world STOP 
START an early hope that UNK might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon UNK STOP 
START interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve as a useful UNK method for UNK UNK losses and for UNK some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or without UNK heat or UNK with their attendant taste UNK STOP 
START factors responsible for the UNK of foods the chief factors responsible for the UNK of fresh UNK are 1 microorganisms such as UNK UNK and UNK 2 enzymes 3 insects 4 UNK and 5 chemical reactions STOP 
START microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid UNK of foods STOP 
START of special concern is the growth of UNK such as UNK UNK which UNK UNK products STOP 
START UNK action in stored food produces changes which can UNK affect the appearance of food or its UNK STOP 
START UNK by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment as in UNK of the walls of metal UNK or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce UNK STOP 
START UNK is a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes UNK UNK UNK and similar root vegetables STOP 
START insect UNK is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain STOP 
START the presence of UNK UNK such as UNK UNK in UNK UNK another factor which must be dealt with in food processing STOP 
START to permit the storage of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and UNK of UNK action STOP 
START the term UNK applies to methods involving essentially complete destruction of all microorganisms STOP 
START food treated in this manner and protected from UNK by UNK methods of UNK and UNK presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration STOP 
START the process of UNK involves UNK and less prolonged heat treatment which UNK the destruction of most but not all of the microorganisms STOP 
START less severe thermal treatment as by UNK or UNK serves to UNK enzymes STOP 
START general effects of UNK radiation UNK radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food UNK or at lower doses can UNK their action STOP 
START it UNK a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain UNK UNK present in meats STOP 
START UNK of enzymes is also possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 UNK or more STOP 
START because of UNK UNK UNK colors and generally low UNK associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude the UNK of enzymes is best accomplished prior to UNK by the conventional UNK methods of UNK STOP 
START radiation does not UNK the chemical UNK of food STOP 
START it will however UNK the UNK of potatoes and other root vegetables STOP 
START the radiation doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following UNK 1 STOP 
START UNK UNK to destroy all UNK for long-term preservation about UNK UNK for UNK foods of low salt content STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK UNK to partially destroy microorganisms vary with types of food storage conditions and objectives of treatment commonly of the order of UNK UNK but up to about UNK aj STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK destruction of insects about UNK aj STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START for UNK the UNK of root vegetables UNK to 10,000 aj STOP 
START UNK foods with UNK radiation leads to some UNK side effects particularly at the higher radiation UNK STOP 
START in this respect the general UNK and individual acceptance of most UNK foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods STOP 
START a number of foods are quite acceptable as UNK taste and UNK however at UNK substantially less than UNK levels STOP 
START moreover the UNK value of UNK foods apparently UNK little if any change although some of the UNK UNK are affected by UNK doses STOP 
START radiation sources for UNK of food the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation and x-ray UNK and UNK electron radiation are suitable STOP 
START aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain practical advantages example UNK UNK give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or UNK whereas UNK electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be UNK STOP 
START selection of a source for commercial UNK would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate load factor UNK convenience safety and most important costs STOP 
START of the UNK useful sources of UNK UNK UNK sources UNK UNK UNK products or a UNK UNK loop system using a material such as an UNK salt have received most attention for UNK systems STOP 
START of the various particle UNK the van de UNK machines UNK UNK and linear UNK are the principal ones available for commercial use STOP 
START costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major UNK in the development of UNK processes STOP 
START estimated production costs of radiation energy from machine and UNK sources range from $1 to UNK per aj STOP 
START conventional energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per UNK for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per UNK for process steam STOP 
START radiation therefore is at an initial cost UNK even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for UNK or UNK STOP 
START what are the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future has been estimated that for applications on a UNK scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per UNK for UNK UNK or for UNK radiation generated in a UNK core STOP 
START no comparable UNK in the cost of UNK radiation are UNK STOP 
START such UNK however appear highly UNK and the UNK involved are far beyond those UNK for UNK facilities STOP 
START because agricultural activities are UNK and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered UNK and because of the high cost of UNK bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location the use of large central processing stations where UNK radiation facilities approaching the UNK range might be UNK is UNK UNK STOP 
START present status of UNK preservation of foods the objective of complete UNK of foods is to produce a wholesome and UNK product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time STOP 
START chief interest in UNK UNK in the military services STOP 
START for them providing UNK food under battle or emergency conditions is a UNK consideration STOP 
START they require completely UNK foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably items already UNK and ready to eat STOP 
START high UNK value variety UNK and UNK appearance are important for reasons of morale STOP 
START foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration are also of interest STOP 
START of primary interest are meats STOP 
START UNK which produces fewer adverse UNK changes in food products has potential usefulness in UNK the keeping qualities of fresh and UNK food items STOP 
START thus food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak UNK and UNK STOP 
START commercial interest is chiefly in this type of treatment as is military interest under UNK conditions STOP 
START the present status of food preservation by UNK radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs STOP 
START meats the radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation STOP 
START to date the one meat showing favorable results at UNK doses is UNK STOP 
START of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that UNK UNK after UNK is superior in UNK to available UNK UNK products STOP 
START tests with beef have been largely UNK because of the development of UNK STOP 
START a prime objective of the army UNK corps program is to find the reasons for UNK low UNK and means of UNK it since it is a major and desirable UNK item STOP 
START partly because UNK heat treatment is needed to UNK enzymes before UNK treated fresh meats have the appearance of UNK or UNK meat STOP 
START UNK is a less severe problem with the UNK of meats but problems of commercial UNK remain STOP 
START moderate radiation doses of from UNK to UNK UNK can extend the shelf life at 35 f of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks STOP 
START however the problem of consumer UNK remains STOP 
START the UNK UNK process UNK the treated beef and liquid UNK in UNK cuts STOP 
START UNK beef UNK in the absence of oxygen UNK an UNK pink color STOP 
START when UNK and UNK are UNK at UNK doses the meat becomes UNK the fat becomes UNK and again UNK changes in color occur STOP 
START ground meats such as fresh UNK UNK and UNK have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and UNK might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities STOP 
START however a major problem here is one of scale of processing meats are usually prepared from UNK meats at the local level whereas UNK at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities STOP 
START the problems of color change by UNK and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts STOP 
START UNK UNK items containing meat portions as in frozen UNK might offer a potential use for UNK STOP 
START the principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be UNK and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen STOP 
START a UNK item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type STOP 
START competitive processes for UNK meats are by UNK and freezing STOP 
START costs of UNK meat are in the range of UNK to 5 cents per pound of freezing are in the area of 2 to UNK cents per pound STOP 
START the table on page 10 shows costs of UNK and freezing meat and estimated costs for UNK under certain assumed conditions STOP 
START under the conditions of comparison it will be noted that 1 UNK at 3 UNK is more expensive than UNK particularly for the UNK source STOP 
START 2 UNK by either the electron UNK or UNK source is in the range of freezing costs STOP 
START 3 UNK using the UNK source is more expensive than use of an electron UNK STOP 
START poultry results of UNK tests with poultry have been quite successful STOP 
START at UNK doses good UNK results with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor STOP 
START UNK has also been successful and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under UNK storage as compared with about 10 days for the UNK product STOP 
START acceptable taste and odor are retained by the UNK and UNK chicken STOP 
START acceptance of UNK is likely to be delayed however for two reasons 1 the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and UNK practices and 2 treatment by UNK a measure already approved by the federal food and drug administration serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about UNK cents per pound STOP 
START UNK fresh UNK products are extremely UNK STOP 
START although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the UNK could be served adequately STOP

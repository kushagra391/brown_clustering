START scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics STOP 
START without UNK the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go UNK would not have any means of UNK UNK and UNK the things they discover and learn STOP 
START UNK and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are therefore essential to any scientific UNK STOP 
START hot UNK is a science STOP 
START it's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth UNK on its axis or building a UNK or putting a UNK into orbit but it is nevertheless a science STOP 
START but because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot UNK must necessarily be a UNK STOP 
START a guy can be an active and successful hot UNK for years without becoming even UNK involved with mathematical problems he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he UNK the few formulas that apply to UNK STOP 
START a mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for UNK a specific problem STOP 
START it places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed STOP 
START the first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula STOP 
START this changes the formula to an equation STOP 
START the equation is used for the mathematical process of UNK the problem STOP 
START UNK for UNK formulas are not complicated STOP 
START they involve only simple mathematics that are taught in UNK school UNK classes STOP 
START however it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the UNK be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order STOP 
START they indicate simple division UNK UNK and addition STOP 
START the symbol for division is a straight line that UNK two numbers placed one above the other STOP 
START the lower number is always divided into the upper number af STOP 
START the symbol for UNK is UNK STOP 
START it is used to separate two or more numbers in a row STOP 
START for example af STOP 
START numbers to be UNK together may be UNK in any order STOP 
START the result will be the same regardless of the order used STOP 
START the symbol for UNK is the standard UNK sign STOP 
START this is nothing more than a dash STOP 
START it UNK two or more numbers STOP 
START the number on the right of the symbol is always UNK from the number on the left of the symbol STOP 
START for example af STOP 
START when more than two figures are separated by UNK symbols the UNK must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct STOP 
START for example for the problem af 10 from 25 UNK 15 then 6 from 15 UNK 9 STOP 
START addition is indicated by the symbol STOP 
START the symbol is used to separate two or more numbers STOP 
START for example af STOP 
START numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order STOP 
START when UNK an equation that involves division as well as other steps do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value STOP 
START UNK UNK and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right STOP 
START completing the division first also includes those division parts that require UNK UNK or addition steps af STOP 
START this would be reduced by UNK 8 times 6 and then UNK the product by 12 STOP 
START this part of the equation would then become 4 STOP 
START for use in formulas fractions should be converted to their UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK way to do this is with a conversion chart STOP 
START UNK for this purpose are available from many sources STOP 
START they are included in all types of mathematical UNK and they are UNK on some types of precision measuring instruments STOP 
START the various mathematical processes can be UNK by carrying the results to only two or three UNK places STOP 
START UNK the results in this manner will not have any UNK effect on the accuracy of the final result STOP 
START some formulas contain UNK STOP 
START a constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation STOP 
START it is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly STOP 
START UNK formulas apply to many phases of the sport STOP 
START the answers they give can often UNK the way to performance increases and quite often are necessary for completing entry UNK for different events STOP 
START when it is needed one formula is as important as another STOP 
START however some formulas are used more than others STOP 
START we'll take them in the general order of their popularity STOP 
START engine displacement a UNK should be able to UNK the displacement of his engine STOP 
START displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume STOP 
START most entry UNK for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions STOP 
START it is good to be able to UNK displacement so that changes in it resulting from UNK and UNK can be computed STOP 
START factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the UNK UNK the length of the UNK stroke the number of UNK in the engine and a constant STOP 
START the constant is which is UNK of UNK another constant known as UNK STOP 
START UNK is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles STOP 
START actually the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of UNK in the engine STOP 
START the UNK area of the UNK is determined and then the volume of the individual UNK is computed by UNK the area by the stroke length which is the equivalent of the length of the UNK STOP 
START UNK the result by the number of UNK in the engine gives the UNK total displacement STOP 
START the formula is af STOP 
START dimensions in inches and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches STOP 
START dimensions in UNK and fractions of UNK will give the displacement in cubic UNK UNK STOP 
START one inch UNK UNK UNK one cubic inch UNK UNK cubic UNK STOP 
START for example let's consider a standard UNK cubic inch UNK aj STOP 
START these engines have a cylinder diameter of UNK inches and a stroke length of 3 inches STOP 
START the formula with the fractions converted to UNK becomes af STOP 
START to arrive at the answer UNK the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right STOP 
START the different steps will look like this af STOP 
START UNK ratio a UNK UNK ratio is computed by UNK the UNK volume or its displacement with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber STOP 
START cylinder volume can be determined UNK but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid STOP 
START cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula af STOP 
START to measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head UNK the UNK and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its UNK surface is level STOP 
START then UNK water or light oil from a graduated UNK into the chamber to fill the chamber to its UNK surface STOP 
START do not UNK the chamber STOP 
START this is possible with water and other UNK that have a high surface tension STOP 
START such UNK will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber STOP 
START the amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by UNK the quantity still in the UNK when the chamber is full from the original quantity STOP 
START most UNK are graduated in cubic UNK UNK making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches STOP 
START however the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic UNK STOP 
START the UNK ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic UNK are used STOP 
START the only UNK is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms STOP 
START the volume of the cylinder opening in the head UNK must be computed by UNK its area in square inches by the UNK thickness in UNK of an inch STOP 
START sometimes it is necessary to roughly UNK the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final UNK STOP 
START the volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume STOP 
START another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the UNK and the top of the cylinder block when the UNK is in top dead center position STOP 
START UNK this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the UNK head as accurately as possible with a depth UNK or some other precision measuring device and then UNK the area of the cylinder by the depth STOP 
START the formula for this step is af STOP 
START this volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head UNK opening STOP 
START the total of these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume STOP 
START after the factors just described have been computed they are applied to the following formula af STOP 
START for an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches STOP 
START applying these figures to the formula we get the equation af STOP 
START the UNK ratio is 10 to 1 STOP 
START this method of computing UNK ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have UNK with either UNK or UNK shaped heads STOP 
START any UNK on the UNK heads will make it impossible with normal means to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume UNK by the UNK heads cannot be readily computed STOP 
START the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such UNK are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is UNK to the cylinder block and the UNK is in top dead center position STOP 
START gear ratio speed relationships there are four UNK of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed engine speed rear UNK gear ratio and rear tire size STOP 
START by using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three STOP 
START to UNK the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors STOP 
START these are UNK for car speed for engine UNK speed for rear UNK gear ratio for tire size STOP 
START tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the UNK and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective UNK of a wheel and tire assembly STOP 
START this is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear UNK shaft STOP 
START a tire must be UNK to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made STOP 
START the measurement must be in inches STOP 
START any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a UNK equivalent to UNK the mathematics STOP 
START when tire size is measured in this manner a constant of UNK is used in the formula STOP 
START to determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula is af STOP 
START for an engine speed of UNK UNK a gear ratio of UNK to 1 and a tire UNK of 13 inches the equation would look like this af STOP 
START to determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is af STOP 
START using the same figures as for the previous example the equation becomes af STOP 
START to determine the rear UNK gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors the formula is af STOP 
START using the figures from the previous examples the equation becomes af STOP

START the reality to which they respond is UNK empty and their art is an imitation of the UNK UNK of this unknown and empty world STOP 
START their artistic UNK is given to the witness of UNK STOP 
START these UNK concerns imitation vs. UNK reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time STOP 
START the breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all UNK of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have UNK the UNK processes STOP 
START thus the image of man has suffered complete UNK in personal and spiritual qualities and complete UNK in UNK and UNK powers STOP 
START the image of the world tends to reflect the UNK and indifference of man or else to UNK into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery STOP 
START the image of god has simply disappeared STOP 
START all such UNK of negative quality have given rise to a UNK response in the form of a heroic and highly UNK UNK if man can neither know nor love reality as it is he can at least UNK an artistic reality which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved STOP 
START the person of the artist becomes a final UNK of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems STOP 
START whatever pole of this contrast one UNK and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive that they belong together STOP 
START without the decay of a sense of objective reference except as the imitation of mystery the stress on subjective invention would never have been UNK into being STOP 
START and although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves UNK for a UNK philosophy of art their peculiar UNK in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written STOP 
START for better or worse we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of classical UNK or detached realism STOP 
START a broader concept of imitation is needed one which UNK that true invention is important that the UNK UNK in part UNK the UNK UNK factors out of which it arises STOP 
START on the other hand we cannot regard artistic invention as pure UNK and UNK to the times in which it occurs STOP 
START we need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the UNK and UNK of pure UNK STOP 
START accordingly it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation and a new theory of invention which i shall call symbol for reasons to be stated UNK STOP 
START the UNK imagination in the arts the word mimesis imitation is usually associated with plato and aristotle STOP 
START for plato imitation is twice removed from reality being a poor copy of physical appearance which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence STOP 
START all artistic and mythological UNK therefore are UNK of UNK and are completely UNK by the truth value of UNK the proper use of the UNK UNK STOP 
START in plato's judgment the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young prior to the full development of their intellectual powers STOP 
START UNK in plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most UNK wisdom STOP 
START aristotle also tended to UNK all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and like plato he put the pure and UNK UNK on the top level STOP 
START the UNK in UNK that all human arts are UNK of imitation gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did plato STOP 
START but aristotle kept the principle of levels and even UNK it by describing in the UNK what kinds of character and action must be UNK if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human UNK STOP 
START for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis in contrast to the power of UNK is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality STOP 
START the central concern of UNK UNK impressive volume called mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation based upon a recognition of levels of truth to a christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved STOP 
START following the theme of UNK in the UNK the christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality STOP 
START here artistic realism involves the audience in an UNK participation in events whose UNK and implications are UNK STOP 
START artistic mimesis under christian influence records the involvement of all persons however humble in a divine drama STOP 
START the artist unlike the philosopher is not a removed observer UNK at neutral and UNK high levels of abstraction STOP 
START he is the UNK of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped STOP 
START i have chosen to use the word mimesis in its christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which as in the christian mind are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience which are not reserved as in the greek mind only to moments of theoretical reflection STOP 
START in the first instance mimesis is here used to mean the UNK of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional UNK STOP 
START by image is meant not only a visual presentation but also remembered UNK of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately UNK UNK STOP 
START this is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original UNK stimulus by which the images were first appropriated STOP 
START mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual UNK of experience in which the UNK person UNK through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself STOP 
START the images themselves like their counterparts in experience are not neutral qualities to be UNK UNK are fields of force UNK a unique influence on the UNK and a unique UNK to one another STOP 
START they bring an UNK component of value within themselves with UNK and UNK native to their own quality STOP 
START as in experience one is seized by given entities and their UNK and is forced to respond in value feelings to them so one is similarly seized in the UNK presentation of images STOP 
START mimesis here is not to be confused with UNK or realism in the conventional sense STOP 
START a word taken in its dictionary meaning a photographic image of a UNK object the mere UNK of a scene tends to lose UNK UNK and to UNK such conventional UNK as to invite neutral reception without the UNK of value feelings STOP 
START similarly experience itself can be UNK so that people react to certain UNK UNK for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their UNK field STOP 
START a truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional UNK to a sense of UNK STOP 
START the UNK character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials STOP 
START when words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds when tones of sound and colors of paint and the UNK shape all strike the UNK with an UNK force of data in and of themselves UNK the observer into an attitude of attention all this UNK the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and UNK for entrance STOP 
START these are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and UNK the self into decision and choice STOP 
START the presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the UNK with which the work demands attention and UNK UNK even though it is but vaguely understood STOP 
START underlying these UNK of mimesis are certain UNK concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some UNK before the main argument can proceed STOP 
START experience is not seen as it is in classical UNK as UNK us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and UNK their character movements and changes on the UNK UNK of an UNK UNK STOP 
START neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern UNK in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of UNK qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs STOP 
START primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects houses trees UNK etc. nor a collection of isolated and neutral UNK qualities STOP 
START in contrast to all this primary data are data of a self involved in UNK processes and powers STOP 
START the most primitive feelings are UNK value feelings both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into UNK desire to avoid and UNK this or that other part STOP 
START these desires UNK a sense of UNK UNK powers in which one is involved some working for one's good others threatening ill STOP 
START gone is the UNK UNK of the mind STOP 
START in its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by UNK of process in which one is caught STOP 
START the principal UNK of this view of primary experience as UNK UNK is alfred north UNK STOP 
START our most elemental and UNK impressions he says are those of being involved in a large UNK of powers which have a longer past than our own which are UNK in a vast movement through the present toward the future STOP 
START we feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening STOP 
START later UNK and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these UNK of value but the UNK themselves are the primary stuff of experience STOP 
START it takes a great deal of abstraction to free UNK from the primitive impression of larger UNK of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern UNK of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection STOP 
START UNK is here questioning david UNK understanding of the nature of experience is questioning also every UNK which stems from UNK UNK that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from UNK UNK and that UNK UNK is something UNK UNK to the world not directly perceived STOP 
START what UNK calls sensation is what UNK calls perception in the mode of UNK UNK which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of UNK UNK STOP 
START as long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data most of the quality and UNK of existence loses its UNK becomes an invention of consciousness and the result is a philosophical UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of UNK and UNK processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding for all its UNK and tendency to mistake the detail is initially given in the way man feels the world STOP 
START in this respect experience is broader and full of a UNK variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct STOP 
START a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of UNK UNK is one of UNK from the past STOP 
START both i and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the UNK which i now am STOP

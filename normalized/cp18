START she called then to say she had a UNK for that night STOP 
START UNK appreciated the chance to make some money STOP 
START such a nice little thing lives right in the building STOP 
START that's UNK i said UNK STOP 
START i could get along without that three dollars STOP 
START in some ways it was worth being out the money just knowing i was no longer UNK to nadine was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang STOP 
START i stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour STOP 
START i answered to find nadine at the other end STOP 
START you scared me half to death i said UNK STOP 
START what's wrong UNK nobody answers at the apartment voice came UNK STOP 
START i'm absolutely frantic stupid girl might have gone off and left UNK oh she wouldn't do that i said STOP 
START she's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone STOP 
START but if you're worried you can go home and check i can't leave the party at ken UNK apartment and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat mr. UNK is already down on wally and we simply can't afford to get ken mad at us i was all set for what came next STOP 
START UNK could you possibly go over and make sure UNK all right call you there in ten minutes i can't make it in ten minutes wondering as i said it why i should make it at all STOP 
START why should i go over at midnight to check on UNK when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party fifteen minutes then UNK STOP 
START i'll be glad to pay you so sure that money could do anything all right i said STOP 
START i'd do it STOP 
START not for the dollar or so nadine would give me STOP 
START but because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment and if i didn't go over who would was sound asleep and i didn't see any sense in waking him STOP 
START i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the table telling him what had happened STOP 
START i drove off through the cool darkness to UNK apartment and rang the bell and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door STOP 
START her face was UNK from sleep STOP 
START it's all right i said as she started to look scared STOP 
START mrs. roberts had called and couldn't wake you STOP 
START i just came over to make sure everything was all right STOP 
START i'm hard to wake up she UNK STOP 
START she didn't look over thirteen STOP 
START and nadine insisted that her UNK be reliable i have to get up early for church tomorrow she went on STOP 
START i didn't know it was going to be this late phone started UNK STOP 
START that's mrs. roberts again i said STOP 
START i'll answer it STOP 
START i crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone STOP 
START i told nadine everything was fine and that i'd be getting on home STOP 
START UNK would you mind staying was a UNK edge to her voice now as if she'd been crying STOP 
START UNK drunk i'll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i don't want UNK to see him like this STOP 
START you know how gossip of that sort UNK through an apartment building not a word of thanks for what i'd already done STOP 
START the receiver UNK in my ear STOP 
START she didn't even give me a chance to refuse STOP 
START well there wasn't any law that said i had to stay then i looked at UNK and thought that i might as well the child needed her sleep and heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be with wally coming home drunk STOP 
START so i told her mrs. roberts would pay her in the morning and she UNK off to her own apartment STOP 
START after i looked in at UNK i went into the living room and waited STOP 
START i must have UNK off because i came to with a start at the sound of voices STOP 
START UNK UNK with anger UNK loud and thick as i went to the door i heard the clock strike two STOP 
START i opened the door and wally stumbled in fast as if nadine had pushed him STOP 
START i had always thought she was so beautiful STOP 
START but now she looked ugly STOP 
START her skin was stretched so tight that her UNK stuck out and if looks could kill wally would have been dead STOP 
START pack your clothes she UNK STOP 
START pack and get out you're crazy wally said UNK STOP 
START he UNK and stumbled to the UNK and sank down on it and was instantly asleep STOP 
START nadine UNK over to him and her pointed nails UNK across his face STOP 
START i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and she was crazy STOP 
START you stay out of this she UNK at me STOP 
START he's ruined us do you hear me he's ruined us UNK ken UNK eyes were wild STOP 
START he told ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman the other people there were listening ruined and he's going to get out if i have to throw him down the stairs you'd better UNK down i said UNK STOP 
START i was plenty scared STOP 
START in the state she was in she could actually kill him now you just take it easy and i'll make you some tea tea nadine UNK STOP 
START how can you be so damn stupid lost his job will never forgive him never we don't have any money we don't have a UNK we own is UNK bedroom set and the UNK player and we even UNK on them STOP 
START and we'll be poor and have to live in a UNK little house like yours and all because of that i UNK my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of UNK STOP 
START stop that wake up the whole building STOP 
START wally can't go any place at this hour well then i'll get out but she looked uncertain STOP 
START she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go UNK off anywhere at two in the morning STOP 
START you go to bed i said UNK STOP 
START in the morning you and wally can talk things out she collapsed against me as if everything inside her snapped STOP 
START i got her into bed and sat with her until she had UNK herself out STOP 
START it was three o'clock before i figured it was all right to go STOP 
START i left her a limp bundle of UNK shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her STOP 
START wally was UNK on the UNK STOP 
START i had done all i could STOP 
START i had done all i was going to do STOP 
START whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine STOP 
START i drove home found chris still asleep STOP 
START i UNK up close to him loving him UNK for a man like him STOP 
START UNK i wasn't nadine STOP 
START i kept on being UNK STOP 
START in the afternoon nadine and wally came over with UNK STOP 
START wally sat in our big chair his hands between his knees looking ready to cry STOP 
START i'd had all this trouble with the old man that's why i drank so much STOP 
START i got fired yesterday for not attending to business old mr. UNK himself had stopped at the service station for a UNK job wally UNK and couldn't get one because there were cars on the UNK waiting to be repaired STOP 
START seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side STOP 
START mr. UNK had gotten wally on the phone and fired him STOP 
START i thought i'd smooth things over through ken wally said UNK STOP 
START but ken got UNK and wouldn't make any promises STOP 
START and i was UNK and i blew my UNK and told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman tried to quiet nadine because the children were there STOP 
START but she was beyond UNK what she said STOP 
START things may smooth over yet chris said his nice lean face grave with honest concern STOP 
START but i couldn't help thinking that nadine and wally were getting just what they deserved STOP 
START now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough STOP 
START when a bubble breaks there's nothing STOP 
START little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy UNK way nadine and wally had lived STOP 
START they had not only spent every cent they were in debt up to their UNK UNK on everything they owned STOP 
START on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written notice that he was fired they were UNK STOP 
START worst of all wally had no training for any kind of work STOP 
START he had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was UNK STOP 
START chris UNK STOP 
START i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over STOP 
START i said i wished we were too STOP 
START it was easy enough to say it because of course we couldn't spare a cent STOP 
START but chris UNK up like a candle STOP 
START i'm glad you feel that way honey STOP 
START there is one big way we can help them STOP 
START we can let them move in with us something i had simply never thought of STOP 
START something so incredible i just stared at him STOP 
START it was incredible he gave me an UNK pleading look STOP 
START i know we'd be pretty crowded STOP 
START but it would only be for a couple of weeks until they get straightened out STOP 
START straightened out they'd had years of making all that money i won't do it i said UNK STOP 
START nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this now she can sleep in the street for all i care that isn't like you UNK chris said UNK STOP 
START then i felt uncomfortable too STOP 
START i didn't want to be like that mean and bitter STOP 
START but UNK it all why should we help a couple of UNK UNK who had looked down their UNK at us in the end we did STOP 
START it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do STOP 
START the finance company took all their furniture and they didn't have a cent to their name STOP 
START then wally got sick STOP 
START to my way of thinking he was scared sick STOP 
START his luck had failed him and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world STOP 
START chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of UNK nadine had bought on special STOP 
START at least we'll eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away STOP 
START while i worked nadine sat and cried STOP 
START when she wasn't crying she was in our bedroom fighting with wally STOP 
START virus UNK nothing she'd scream at him STOP 
START you're too UNK to go out and look for another job STOP 
START you're just a UNK UNK was a mess all right STOP 
START but it couldn't go on forever a couple of weeks chris had said STOP 
START i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks STOP 
START but the two weeks dragged into three and they were still with us STOP 
START UNK constant UNK had finally gotten wally out of bed STOP 
START he set out every morning looking for work and come home around noon full of UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK had UNK him STOP 
START nobody would even take his application STOP 
START you can get something nadine would snap STOP 
START you can get a job working in a UNK store if nothing else STOP 
START the high school kids have got everything UNK up he said a UNK in his voice STOP 
START those damn UNK taking work away from men who need it STOP 
START by fall they'll be back in school i'd say trying to sound encouraging STOP 
START but this was only the middle of july STOP 
START and i couldn't take six more weeks of this STOP 
START i mentioned it to chris one UNK hot night when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air STOP

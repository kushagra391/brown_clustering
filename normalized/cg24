START the president's personality would have opened that office to him STOP 
START and for the first time a representative of the highest office in the land would have been UNK to the charge that he had attempted to make it a UNK by UNK STOP 
START it is testimony to the deep respect in which mr. eisenhower was held by members of all parties that the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were not UNK to be UNK STOP 
START these began to be apparent in a press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting specialists might clarify the president's condition for the nation STOP 
START and if howard UNK felt UNK thereafter to UNK the ethics of the medical profession his article in the atlantic monthly accomplished a good deal more STOP 
START it forced us to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical UNK had been placed STOP 
START the discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded us that in the historical perspective the president's decision will finally clarify itself as a moral rather than a medical problem STOP 
START because the responsibility for UNK the issue lay with the president rather than with his doctors nothing raises more surely for us the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems under political pressure STOP 
START for the president had dealt with the matter UNK in what he conceived as the democratic way STOP 
START but the problem is one which gives us the measure of a man rather than a group of men whether a group of doctors a group of party members assembled at a dinner to give their opinion or the masses of the voters STOP 
START any attempt to UNK this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it as the central issue will at least resolve our UNK about the UNK and UNK results of the UNK of both doctors and president in a situation which should never have UNK STOP 
START it was a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which resulted in attempts at UNK STOP 
START in no other situation would a group of doctors struggling UNK to improve the life UNK of a man beloved by the world be subjected to such UNK and persistent questioning and before they were prepared to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problems it faces STOP 
START and though we can look back now and see their errors we can look back also to the ultimate error STOP 
START it UNK in the press conferences the president's remarks about his running developed a singular tone one which we find in few statements made by public individuals on such a matter STOP 
START the press conference became a stage which UNK the drift of his private thinking rather than his convictions STOP 
START he commented thoughtfully a reporter told us that it was not too important for the individual how he ends up STOP 
START he gave us a UNK to explain his admission that even at the worst period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any renewed question about his running as in the battle of the UNK he had no fears about the outcome until he read the american newspapers STOP 
START yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demands in such a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with UNK to be fought regardless of the consequences STOP 
START in this case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears STOP 
START the presidency demands an UNK awareness of the larger implications of the death of any UNK STOP 
START it is of the UNK importance to the people of america and of the world how their governing president ends up during the four years of his term STOP 
START only when that term is ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom and the courage to discount the dangers of his death STOP 
START UNK enough in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury STOP 
START at the national and international level then what is the highest kind of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political UNK STOP 
START and we had the uneasy sense that the UNK between the moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us STOP 
START for the tone of the UNK which greeted mr. eisenhower's original announcement of his running had been UNK UNK STOP 
START neither the UNK enthusiasm which UNK a people's UNK sense of the UNK of things at UNK moments nor the vital UNK UNK its sense that something significant has UNK was in evidence STOP 
START nothing UNK more clearly to that UNK than the peculiar editorial page appearing in a july issue of life magazine the issue which also carried the second announcement of the UNK STOP 
START the double editorial on two aspects of the u.s. spirit was UNK calculated to suggest a moral sanction for UNK great as well as small reflecting popular approval of this UNK attitude toward the highest office in the land STOP 
START the moral UNK and the will to risk live happily together if we do not examine where the line is to be drawn STOP 
START i may possibly be a greater risk than is the normal person of my age the president had said on february UNK of the election year UNK the fact that no one of his age had ever lived out another term STOP 
START my doctors assure me that this increased percentage of risk is not great STOP 
START but by the time the risk was doubled events had dismissed from his mind both increased UNK and a previously stated intention of considering carefully anything more serious than a UNK of UNK STOP 
START only UNK did the situation color his thinking STOP 
START UNK no president we have had would have regretted more than president eisenhower the possibility to which his own words in the press conference held at the beginning of august testified that unable as he was himself to say his running was best for the country UNK he had placed his party before his nation STOP 
START so it is that we UNK his opening statement in the first television address with the dramatic UNK of the present STOP 
START no consideration of risk UNK itself upon him now for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not properly UNK STOP 
START yet with a mind less shallow if less sharp than some of the UNK UNK which back him he feels what he cannot UNK we watch him amid the UNK which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters STOP 
START moving as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of him he UNK a position that is UNK UNK STOP 
START he UNK to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do has brought him STOP 
START what is simply an opinion formed in UNK of the laws of human probability whether or not it is later confirmed has become by september of the election year a firm conviction STOP 
START as a means of UNK a discussion which ought to have taken place the statement is an effective one we UNK with the universal confusion which gives rise to such convictions STOP 
START but it is also the climax to one of the UNK chapters in our current political history STOP 
START in UNK to god the responsibility which he learned could not rest with his doctors eisenhower gave evidence of that UNK of the moral intuition which was to UNK his administration in the years to follow STOP 
START in any other man this UNK to the UNK would have caused us a profound moral shock STOP 
START about this man we had to think twice STOP 
START we knew that it was as UNK the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature STOP 
START but the fact remains that even the unconscious acceptance of himself as a man of destiny UNK protected must be UNK in any man who UNK the responsibility for his major decisions and thus for UNK his will on the people STOP 
START and in the context of drifting personal UNK we have examined there was occasional evidence of the origin of all such UNK STOP 
START when the possibility that he had not given UNK to so UNK a decision seemed to UNK his UNK mr. eisenhower was known to make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going to talk about the matter any more STOP 
START thinking had stopped was not to be resumed STOP 
START the portrait that had developed UNK but consistently was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking is alien enough that the making of a decision UNK when it does not UNK any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence STOP 
START this does not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have been UNK STOP 
START instead it means that the thinking in which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the decision as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problems the decision had UNK might have done STOP 
START drifting through a third illness apparently without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president eisenhower revealed the UNK static quality of his thinking STOP 
START despite three UNK no sense of moral urgency UNK him to distinguish his situation and thus his responsibilities from UNK STOP 
START by contrast the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision UNK upon him UNK the moral intuition and gives us the measure of the man STOP 
START only by means of an intensive UNK with the detailed considerations following from any decision can he UNK attention to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of UNK in the major decision are effectively to be checked STOP 
START in the UNK struggle with UNK political fact he UNK to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail and to UNK the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant with what is sometimes UNK UNK STOP 
START like lincoln he can distinguish his relation to god from the constitutional responsibilities a UNK decision UNK of him STOP 
START like roosevelt he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of americans from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may UNK upon him STOP 
START he UNK to UNK one to the other sometimes UNK accepting criticism for the lesser UNK facts breed STOP 
START the very nature of a choice so UNK in distinction and fact leads to the valid convictions which become force of will in the UNK leader STOP 
START the capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact and the facility with language which can render them into validity in the eyes of other men are the UNK means for UNK the moral intuition into moral leadership STOP 
START the making of distinctions like the perception of the great distinctions made is an UNK difficult business STOP 
START UNK slow progress towards the several marking his achievement is even now UNK as such and loosely interpreted as the UNK of UNK with vision STOP 
START but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the UNK with which words UNK it we do not UNK examine the type of distinction in the sphere of politics on which decisions hang STOP 
START only recently and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively UNK president kennedy's extraordinary UNK of detail have the abilities on which the capacity for making distinctions depend begun to be clearly UNK at the level of politics STOP 
START in his recent evaluation of kennedy's UNK for leadership walter UNK has cited the precision of his mind his immense command of UNK detail and his instinct for the crucial point as impressive in the extreme it is surely clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the individual's command of language UNK with the other two STOP

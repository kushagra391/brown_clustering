START one day the children had wanted to get up onto general UNK horse STOP 
START they wanted to see what his back felt like the UNK STOP 
START he looked so comfortable being straight STOP 
START they wanted to touch the mystery STOP 
START arlene was UNK them up when the policeman came by STOP 
START he was very UNK STOP 
START arlene had a hard voice too this time STOP 
START the UNK eyes rather UNK for a second then arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasn't for these dear children STOP 
START the policeman got a confused funny look on his face and he had answered kind of UNK now look here lady i know you got to entertain these kids and all STOP 
START but this is a public park and it's a city UNK that the UNK cannot be crawled on STOP 
START arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said yes sir STOP 
START the policeman walked on but he looked back once STOP 
START that had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred STOP 
START arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area they had told their mother about the UNK STOP 
START in matters of exact information that kept her one step behind developments so they were consistently true to their principles STOP 
START never mind arlene had said after the policeman had left having pursued the usual UNK course of UNK STOP 
START never mind STOP 
START i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn STOP 
START what is it the children whose UNK and UNK were invariably so UNK normal and UNK STOP 
START maybe that was why they were UNK and loyal towards the UNK of arlene STOP 
START just you wait advised arlene UNK the dialogue in a recent british movie STOP 
START and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most UNK magnificent time STOP 
START first arlene had put them through some rapid UNK STOP 
START they had protested that that wasn't any surprise STOP 
START just you wait said arlene again as though she were UNK the UNK UNK UNK of that handy little sturdy statement STOP 
START this is a UNK STOP 
START is it anything like UNK UNK one of the children STOP 
START not the least bit arlene snapped STOP 
START one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously particularly your very very serious questions STOP 
START those were especially the ones that all other UNK laughed at UNK STOP 
START she would sometimes even get a little hard on you she took you so seriously STOP 
START but not hard for very long STOP 
START just long enough to make you feel important STOP 
START now said arlene eventually making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided itself and made their UNK UNK down and feel comfortable STOP 
START now we're going to be like what general UNK and his horse make us think of STOP 
START the children looked at each other and UNK their UNK down even more comfortably than ever STOP 
START their curiosity went happily out of UNK STOP 
START then arlene threw herself UNK and UNK in a way that was just wonderful STOP 
START she held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and UNK STOP 
START imagine being able to laugh and UNK when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home one of them said STOP 
START they both laughed and UNK back STOP 
START i'm general UNK horse UNK down arlene said sort of UNK for her even she had to UNK kind of funny when she was in that position STOP 
START she made general UNK UNK belly do so funny when it was UNK down STOP 
START then she was back on her feet UNK and smiling that enormous smile she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling STOP 
START and she would UNK and throw UNK STOP 
START they both tried to keep smiling and UNK for a long time but it made their lips and UNK UNK STOP 
START but they kept on UNK for a long long time STOP 
START this time arlene said and she even kept on UNK a little bit while she was just talking you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing STOP 
START it all has something to do with general UNK and his horse STOP 
START this time it was so grand could tell exactly what it was STOP 
START it was general UNK horse running in a circle STOP 
START his legs shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his UNK to his shoulders STOP 
START that's the UNK horse one of them cried out STOP 
START the other remarked in a happy laughter that's a funny old horse STOP 
START the first one said he sure does shake STOP 
START he's old STOP 
START then there was the general UNK his wife STOP 
START they had to be told that one STOP 
START but it was even UNK after they had been told STOP 
START their father when he came back from those many business trips just UNK their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the UNK and put them in the electric UNK STOP 
START but not general UNK STOP 
START he was the UNK man STOP 
START he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet STOP 
START then they had to get up and be general UNK STOP 
START or his horse STOP 
START all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking their legs out STOP 
START it wasn't very funny STOP 
START then they said general UNK was going to jump over his UNK head they did some UNK STOP 
START but that wasn't very funny either STOP 
START you ought to shake arlene advised them STOP 
START and arlene showed them how to begin STOP 
START she also taught them to sing i wish i could UNK like my sister kate STOP 
START that helped a lot STOP 
START they were UNK but they were beginning to catch on STOP 
START they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling STOP 
START imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling or smiling with your lips trembling too much arlene suggested STOP 
START that helped a great deal STOP 
START they were a little late in getting home STOP 
START i'm sorry mrs. UNK arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it STOP 
START my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us STOP 
START it's perfectly understandable arlene my mother said in a friendly way STOP 
START i suppose you all were playing and forgot yes UNK the children UNK UNK STOP 
START we couldn't help laughing STOP 
START the children rushed off to get rid of their UNK arlene began UNK the kitchen door open STOP 
START UNK a good girl my uncle remarked to us he said it too soon for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded STOP 
START that tap had a slight UNK quality STOP 
START she really is a dear little thing my mother agreed STOP 
START her upper lip lifted slightly STOP 
START she was UNK into a small red UNK that action always caused her to lift her lip from the UNK of the thing STOP 
START also she lived in UNK fear of finding a white UNK curled up in a neat mean little heap at the white center of the UNK STOP 
START she would try to see over the UNK of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was UNK STOP 
START it never worked naturally it made her look unusual STOP 
START also when she had UNK off half of the small UNK she found the UNK UNK she would UNK the UNK half of the UNK out to where she could inspect it STOP 
START one could hear a very faint UNK sigh of relief STOP 
START actually it was UNK to anyone not expecting it STOP 
START but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public STOP 
START later on the children told her further about UNK STOP 
START it must be UNK good for them STOP 
START and UNK kind of arlene she told us later STOP 
START but do you know something curious added STOP 
START i reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress STOP 
START i have no notion why i reached STOP 
START and i found a UNK STOP 
START was it an UNK thought for a second STOP 
START but i would not UNK myself in that silly way STOP 
START i opened the window and threw the UNK out STOP 
START then my mother UNK at this small lie she knew and we knew that it was UNK that had made one more UNK that night just too impossible a strain STOP 
START arlene became indispensable could have told why STOP 
START but she was STOP 
START it was in the air STOP 
START a friend of my father's came to dinner STOP 
START he was passing through town and UNK to say UNK STOP 
START as a result he was persuaded out to dinner STOP 
START as a matter of fact this happened every four or five months STOP 
START sometimes he UNK with my father's being at home STOP 
START sometimes as at this UNK he did not STOP 
START but he was always persuaded out STOP 
START he liked children in a UNK kind of way two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through UNK for his entertainment STOP 
START when he had left i could never remember whether he had UNK them in their UNK UNK with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action not UNK to look STOP 
START the children UNK him too STOP 
START this evening they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends of UNK distributed over them STOP 
START there had been some UNK in it for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a UNK bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her UNK with a UNK STOP 
START they were pushed gently into the room by arlene whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door STOP 
START we had just sat down STOP 
START tell mr. UNK what you're doing these days my mother advised the children UNK STOP 
START there was an air of UNK about the children even UNK for their own principles STOP 
START this could be told chiefly from a sort of UNK and UNK a UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START possibly the UNK UNK had brought up bitter problems of administration STOP 
START but at the beginning this stayed just in the air STOP 
START we go to the park with this nice lady one of them said STOP 
START we have good times STOP 
START this happy bulletin UNK mr. UNK STOP 
START you do asked between UNK of laughter STOP 
START he was forced to UNK his eyes STOP 
START you don't step on the flowers do you of the children UNK out of range of the UNK index finger STOP 
START no he said STOP 
START we don't STOP 
START mr. UNK took a UNK of his UNK STOP 
START he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her UNK for UNK STOP 
START usually this was done when attention was UNK by someone UNK long UNK story STOP 
START but this time she was nervous she was open STOP 
START mr. UNK was finally in command of his mind again STOP 
START tell me what do you do at the park asked STOP 
START this was delivered in a UNK way without UNK and UNK interest an UNK way with children STOP 
START only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a UNK UNK of the direct command STOP 
START this UNK the children into the revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people but a victory in the wide fields of UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START we UNK one said the other went on to development of the idea STOP 
START we UNK too he said STOP 
START my mother was beside herself with curiosity STOP 
START say that again she UNK STOP 
START she laughed a little and tossed the UNK UNK around in her glass STOP 
START you what could see that mr. UNK was UNK UNK in her took over STOP 
START she was UNK happy STOP 
START you what uncle looked at mr. UNK STOP 
START he read henry james and used to UNK UNK through UNK at people STOP 
START mr. UNK looked down STOP 
START he would not look up STOP 
START he was very funny about the whole thing STOP

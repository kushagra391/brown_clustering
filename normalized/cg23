START during the last years of UNK UNK administration a red UNK developed in our country STOP 
START many americans reacted UNK to the challenge of russia and turned to the UNK of ideas by force STOP 
START UNK general UNK set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the UNK STOP 
START attorney general palmer made a series of UNK that sent more than UNK so-called UNK to the UNK in direct violation of their constitutional rights STOP 
START then not many years later the UNK activities committee under the leadership of martin dies UNK hundreds of decent UNK citizens STOP 
START anyone who tried to remedy some of the most UNK defects in our form of democracy was UNK as a UNK red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government STOP 
START this UNK reached its height under the leadership of senator joseph UNK STOP 
START UNK of this sort found communist UNK UNK behind any new idea that would run counter to UNK notions STOP 
START new ideas were dangerous and must be UNK no matter how STOP 
START those who would UNK dangerous thoughts credit ideas with high UNK STOP 
START they give strict interpretation to william UNK statement that every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself STOP 
START they seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new STOP 
START hence the only UNK procedure is to UNK any and every notion unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe STOP 
START despite this danger however we are informed on every hand that ideas not machines are our finest tools are UNK even though they cannot be recorded on a UNK page are the most valuable of commodities and the most UNK for their demand far UNK supply STOP 
START so UNK are ideas we are told that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes those who UNK new ideas of their own and those who UNK beg or UNK from others STOP 
START seemingly with an UNK flow of ideas all will be well and we are even assured that an idea a day will keep the sheriff away STOP 
START that however may also bring the police if the thinking does not meet with social approval STOP 
START UNK as well as model citizens exercise their minds STOP 
START merely having a mental image of some sort is not the UNK consideration STOP 
START of course there must be clarity a single distinct impression is more valuable than many UNK ones STOP 
START but clarity is not enough STOP 
START the writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st. joseph missouri STOP 
START an UNK a former university professor UNK to us logically and clearly that someone was UNK his thoughts STOP 
START he appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done STOP 
START despite the clarity of his presentation his idea was not of UNK UNK STOP 
START true ideas are important perhaps UNK most precious UNK STOP 
START but have we not gone UNK in UNK their significance we not actually developed idea worship we must have and we seek them everywhere STOP 
START we UNK literature for them we find stored the wisdom of great minds STOP 
START but are all these works worthy of consideration they stand rigid scrutiny wit and wisdom his profound insight into human nature have stood the test of centuries STOP 
START but was he UNK in all things of his treatment of the jew in the merchant of UNK gives us a vivid picture of UNK but probably he never saw a jew unless in some of his UNK STOP 
START the jews had been UNK from england in UNK and were not permitted to return before UNK when shakespeare had been dead for UNK years STOP 
START if any had escaped UNK by hiding they certainly would not frequent the UNK STOP 
START shakespeare did not usually UNK the incidents in his plays but borrowed them from old stories UNK and plays UNK them together and then UNK into them his spark of life STOP 
START rather than from a UNK study of jewish people his UNK of UNK stems from a collection of italian stories UNK UNK published in UNK although written almost two centuries earlier STOP 
START he could learn at second hand from books but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit STOP 
START harris j. UNK in shaking the dust from shakespeare UNK writes there is not a word spoken by UNK which one would expect from a real jew STOP 
START he took the story of the pound of flesh and had to UNK it on someone STOP 
START the jew was the UNK victim STOP 
START no jew was on hand to UNK his UNK struggling theater STOP 
START it would have been UNK policy for instance to apply the UNK UNK to the UNK UNK STOP 
START just as now anyone may UNK UNK at a citizen of mars or even of UNK and no UNK investigation will result STOP 
START who UNK about them does not tell us that UNK was an UNK individual STOP 
START he sets him forth as being typical of the group STOP 
START he tells of his jewish heart not a UNK heart a jewish heart STOP 
START this would make anyone UNK and cruel capable of UNK UNK STOP 
START there is no justification for such UNK STOP 
START if living jews were UNK for study the bible was at hand STOP 
START reading the old testament would have shown the UNK that the ideas attributed to UNK were UNK to the jews STOP 
START are we better off for having UNK idea of UNK the merchant of UNK in high school and college has given many young people their notions about jews STOP 
START does this help the UNK to understand this group de UNK UNK of the spanish UNK put many persons to death STOP 
START his name became UNK with UNK cruelty STOP 
START would we gain by keeping alive his memory and UNK today's roman catholics by saying he had a catholic heart his bones and his memory rest in the UNK century where they belong is out of place in our times STOP 
START UNK UNK too is of UNK value in the modern world STOP 
START ideas in and of themselves are not necessarily the greatest good STOP 
START a successful UNK recently UNK his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all UNK should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally UNK where they and their theories might UNK together STOP 
START will his words come to be UNK and quoted through the years we are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be UNK and UNK and in the end only the good ones will survive STOP 
START but is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory and UNK UNK out UNK and UNK from an array of bottles and then after stirring expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion there some magic in it that UNK results peter b. UNK pride of UNK UNK informed us in UNK that we had an UNK dislike for the japanese did the heated UNK of the UNK settle the truth or UNK of the proposition UNK spots came from the pen of thomas UNK in UNK and in this he announced an UNK law STOP 
START if a child had a single drop of negro blood he would UNK to the UNK line which except as slaves under a superior race had not made one step of progress in UNK years STOP 
START that doctrine has been accepted by many but has it produced good results the same vein a certain UNK plot has been UNK STOP 
START the son and UNK of a prominent family UNK a girl who has UNK shadows on the UNK of her finger nails STOP 
START in time she presents her UNK husband with a UNK child STOP 
START is the world better for having this idea thrust upon it argument and debate decide its truth or UNK answers to such questions we must turn to the UNK the UNK the historians the psychologists and the UNK STOP 
START long ago they UNK the notions of UNK and UNK to the UNK heap STOP 
START false ideas UNK another sector of our life STOP 
START for several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the UNK STOP 
START the UNK almost without exception has been presented as a cruel UNK STOP 
START children conditioned by this mistaken notion have feared UNK while adults by their UNK attitudes have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one STOP 
START debate is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the UNK a happier one STOP 
START research on the other hand has shown many UNK to be UNK successful some far better than the real mothers STOP 
START helen UNK informed us the psychology of women UNK 2 UNK that in all cultures the term UNK automatically UNK UNK implications a conclusion accepted by many STOP 
START will mere debate on that proposition even though it be free and UNK remove the UNK and leave a UNK of UNK gold is UNK to say the least STOP 
START research into several cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one STOP 
START most UNK ideas are UNK STOP 
START but ideas just for the sake of having them are not enough STOP 
START in the UNK UNK for the depression literally UNK washington STOP 
START for a time the president received hundreds of them every day most of them UNK STOP 
START ideas need to be tested and not merely by argument and debate STOP 
START when some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer for instance we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign STOP 
START we have UNK to the UNK specialist in the laboratory STOP 
START the merits of the UNK UNK UNK were not established on the UNK platform or in newspaper UNK but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children STOP 
START our presidential campaigns provide much debate and argument STOP 
START but is the result new UNK of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems we are told is UNK with reason and is capable of UNK good from bad STOP 
START but what a UNK task it is to UNK anything of value from the UNK arguments used so freely particularly since such common use is made of UNK and UNK in themselves UNK of intellectual UNK STOP 
START we are reminded however that freedom of thought and discussion the UNK exchange of ideas is basic under our form of government STOP 
START UNK in our political campaigns there is freedom to think to examine any and all issues and to speak without restraint STOP 
START no holds are UNK STOP 
START but have the results been UNK we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security must not forget to be sure that free discussion and debate have produced beneficial results STOP 
START in truth we can say that this broke the power of senator joseph UNK who was finally exposed in full light to the american people STOP 
START if he had been UNK in some way he would have become a UNK a UNK point for people who shared his ideas STOP 
START debate in the political UNK can be productive of good STOP 
START but it is a UNK and UNK process it can produce negative results but not much that is positive STOP 
START debate rid us of UNK but did not give us much that is positive STOP 
START it did something to clear the ground but it erected no striking new structure did not even provide the UNK plan for anything new STOP 
START in the field of the natural sciences UNK UNK data are quite readily available and any discussion can be UNK with good results STOP 
START in the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of tested knowledge has been UNK that can be used to good advantage STOP 
START by no means would we UNK the production of ideas they provide raw materials with which to work provide UNK that lead to further production STOP 
START we would establish no UNK STOP

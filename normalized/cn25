START early that day matsuo saw a marine STOP 
START the enemy came UNK around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a UNK shot then fled without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were UNK STOP 
START as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand STOP 
START he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed STOP 
START in the UNK part of the tree UNK a broad UNK UNK he could see over the meadow STOP 
START for a while he was content to let events develop in their good time STOP 
START he had no doubt the marine was the lead UNK of a column and while his shot had probably UNK UNK they would soon come hunting STOP 
START his UNK had emphasized that marines UNK others for the sheer pleasure STOP 
START yesterday no surrender STOP 
START his remembering the UNK brought no peace only a faint chill of doubt STOP 
START he murmured to himself with UNK no surrender STOP 
START it was best to die fighting the marines STOP 
START his UNK had also UNK this saying it was the way for eternal honor STOP 
START what if the marines never came UNK were all dead STOP 
START he had no rice STOP 
START then it would be a choice between UNK and suicide STOP 
START UNK the way he would UNK in this vast UNK green his wife never to receive an UNK of his UNK STOP 
START he sighed and leaned for a moment against the UNK STOP 
START his fingers touched the bone handle of a knife STOP 
START the knife an ammunition UNK and a UNK bottle of UNK water hung on his belt STOP 
START besides the belt he wore a UNK cloth STOP 
START as he looked up from picking at a leg UNK he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing STOP 
START gloom UNK STOP 
START the marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though UNK whether to brave the sunlight STOP 
START his UNK made a UNK of almost UNK green in the mist STOP 
START come out come out in the meadow matsuo said under his breath STOP 
START the man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face STOP 
START a signal lifted his rifle UNK the UNK under his left upper arm for UNK STOP 
START fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills STOP 
START they had fought from UNK and the marines UNK to burning them out STOP 
START even now like a UNK in his ears he heard the UNK of UNK UNK great orange UNK STOP 
START a wave of flame UNK through their UNK had reached UNK his friend and with a UNK the man UNK through the entrance then slowed to the UNK walk of a UNK his uniform UNK STOP 
START the marines let him advance STOP 
START when he sank on his knees they had allowed him to UNK without UNK the stroke of mercy STOP 
START matsuo had UNK death and was UNK on a UNK of UNK both the burned and the UNK the latter UNK rapidly under the tropical sun STOP 
START the UNK marines had laughed at each UNK UNK while UNK bodies STOP 
START matsuo repeatedly UNK down his own UNK STOP 
START at UNK he had been able to UNK down a UNK and into the jungle UNK of death STOP 
START UNK he peered to the left to the right into the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START he decided that the marines must be UNK around the meadow with the one left to UNK him STOP 
START he strained his hearing STOP 
START UNK feet UNK on UNK UNK of UNK and UNK he heard none of these STOP 
START only the UNK of insects and the distant UNK call of a bird STOP 
START because he couldn't hear them he was more convinced they were there STOP 
START a spectacle occurred across the meadow the UNK marine took a seat on the ground UNK on a tree UNK he UNK it STOP 
START UNK made matsuo UNK STOP 
START while his UNK UNK the trap that one behaved as if it was some dull UNK STOP 
START taking aim at the man's face matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind STOP 
START he wanted the UNK marine to know fear and so he aimed above the head STOP 
START the shot UNK in UNK UNK of sound STOP 
START UNK followed STOP 
START like a UNK boy expecting punishment matsuo UNK reaction from the jungle STOP 
START how stupid to give his position away STOP 
START the jungle did not UNK STOP 
START the sitter remained seated UNK the tree STOP 
START before long the atmosphere UNK to its old UNK and insects UNK and birds occasionally called STOP 
START matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete UNK UNK that he was the butt of a UNK joke STOP 
START five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing his hands over his eyes STOP 
START he went into a UNK dance a sort of blind UNK of the tail STOP 
START it ended when he tumbled UNK right up he staggered in no particular direction STOP 
START he wore no head cover of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon STOP 
START with a sudden UNK he UNK in UNK direction crossing the meadow in a UNK UNK STOP 
START when he got closer to the tree matsuo noted the wild look on his face STOP 
START the pockets of his jacket UNK STOP 
START hand UNK STOP 
START the UNK head was a poor target so matsuo shot him in the upper UNK STOP 
START the marine spun UNK a hand high on his chest and UNK forward STOP 
START in the UNK that followed the UNK matsuo was tense STOP 
START they could come on him now without difficulty STOP 
START gradually he reached a conclusion STOP 
START the marine was alone for they were UNK people and by now would have UNK to knock him from the tree STOP 
START down the tree he UNK and UNK at the edge of foliage STOP 
START the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended STOP 
START matsuo jumped when the hidden arm UNK out STOP 
START UNK leveled on the man he made a rush STOP 
START heat in the sunlight pressed in like an UNK crowd STOP 
START he UNK by the head gently placing the rifle on the ground STOP 
START with a UNK motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back STOP 
START he was UNK STOP 
START the bullet had UNK in the area of the right UNK the hole blood UNK in a little patch STOP 
START maintaining his UNK on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while UNK in the jacket pockets STOP 
START in one a package of cigarettes and a UNK lighter both UNK from the man's bleeding STOP 
START in the other a UNK with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty UNK STOP 
START one by one he tossed the objects aside STOP 
START he didn't smoke and could not light fires with a UNK lighter had no use any longer for exact time even had the watch been running STOP 
START then there was no saying how many times the marine had UNK his nose on the UNK STOP 
START too bad the marine had no water STOP 
START from its holder he took his own UNK STOP 
START the cap was stuck and made a thin UNK UNK as he applied pressure STOP 
START the UNK eyes opened squeezed shut then opened UNK in the UNK STOP 
START so alive STOP 
START matsuo put the bottle to his own lips STOP 
START the marine reached up a hand STOP 
START matsuo shook his head STOP 
START none for you STOP 
START the marine UNK soon dropping his hand STOP 
START not only had he no UNK but he lacked even the belt to hang one on STOP 
START you came well equipped to die STOP 
START some odor made him lean over the man STOP 
START he UNK and recognized it STOP 
START sake STOP 
START so that had been his difficulty STOP 
START drunk on sake he must have UNK off from his UNK STOP 
START the marine tried to roll on his right side and UNK STOP 
START when he rolled on the left side UNK on his left UNK matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over STOP 
START be a good UNK STOP 
START UNK with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle STOP 
START the smell of sake had UNK UNK events in his thoughts STOP 
START in the UNK with other supplies they had kept cases of sake STOP 
START the marine shut his eyes STOP 
START are you a UNK of flame marine took the small knife from its UNK and laid it on the ground out of the UNK reach and away from their shadows STOP 
START he waited in his UNK UNK the hair STOP 
START every so often he turned the knife STOP 
START its blade was UNK in the intense sunlight STOP 
START the sun was noon high and matsuo UNK until his body was UNK STOP 
START wet also were the UNK UNK and the face had an UNK film STOP 
START the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes STOP 
START now and again he murmured something that ended in a UNK STOP 
START he must have UNK himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his UNK UNK STOP 
START matsuo shook his head STOP 
START strange STOP 
START at last he reached for the knife STOP 
START even the bone handle UNK and he UNK the UNK UNK to UNK it STOP 
START first he barely touched the blade on the hand which UNK the eyes STOP 
START the marine yelled and flung the hand away STOP 
START with a firm grip on the man's hair matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek STOP 
START a UNK UNK kicked legs and UNK hands that UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START matsuo UNK free and burned the hands into retreat the other cheek each hand when they came UNK again STOP 
START the marine UNK to weep and it UNK the sense of enjoyment STOP 
START matsuo stood up STOP 
START a small measure of payment marine STOP 
START he dropped the knife in its UNK hung the rifle behind a shoulder STOP 
START the marine hands on cheeks rolled by his UNK side onto his stomach STOP 
START he ceased UNK STOP 
START matsuo walked toward his tree once UNK back STOP 
START the marine was still STOP 
START he would soon die STOP 
START as matsuo climbed by using the UNK and kicking his feet against the UNK a mood of gloom UNK him like a jungle shadow STOP 
START what now the jungle birds were UNK while insects preserved only the UNK of living STOP 
START someone called STOP 
START it was the marine head lifted he strained and called STOP 
START then he UNK matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat STOP 
START he UNK his mouth and yelled STOP 
START matsuo UNK the rifle off his shoulder STOP 
START once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die STOP 
START he aimed but listened STOP 
START it sounded as if the man were calling him hey japanese hey there japanese STOP 
START the man tilted back his head and went through the UNK of drinking from a UNK STOP 
START he performed the act twice more and the UNK in his tone grew more distinct STOP 
START sake called STOP 
START the marine nodded vigorously STOP 
START matsuo laughed UNK the rifle STOP 
START the marine was a UNK STOP 
START his UNK had said that all marines were UNK STOP 
START the marine UNK forward into a bow like a priest before an UNK STOP 
START remembering his own UNK matsuo took out his water bottle STOP 
START one UNK was all he would have was very UNK but he must observe water discipline STOP 
START his years of UNK had taught him the value of water discipline STOP 
START he began to UNK the bottle the UNK cap UNK on its UNK STOP 
START UNK upright the marine waved both hands and shouted STOP 
START of course it was water he really UNK in the UNK of the sun he was becoming dried out STOP 
START the marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack STOP 
START matsuo shook his head STOP 
START he had no water for an enemy STOP 
START and when this was gone he hadn't even a little bitter UNK to UNK other water if he were to discover some UNK jungle pool STOP 
START he UNK the bottle and replaced it STOP 
START after all he had less reason to desire it than the marine STOP 
START before much longer the marine UNK down STOP 
START his head UNK STOP 
START the upper part of his UNK had stained dark STOP 
START marine STOP 
START there is nothing for you matsuo said STOP 
START your UNK will certainly beat you for your UNK besides the UNK of it STOP

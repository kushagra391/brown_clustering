START let us see just how typical krim is STOP 
START he is new UNK and jewish STOP 
START he spent one year at the university of north carolina because thomas UNK went there STOP 
START he returned to new york to work for the new UNK to UNK a western UNK to UNK the war in the UNK to write publicity for UNK pictures and UNK for a UNK then he began his career as critic for various magazines STOP 
START now he has abandoned all that to be a writer STOP 
START i do not want to UNK about UNK a certain sense one manner of experience will be typical of any given group while another will not STOP 
START but i've got news for krim he's not typical he's pretty special STOP 
START his may UNK a certain kind of postwar new york experience but his experience is certainly not typical of his UNK STOP 
START in any case who ever thought that new york is typical of anything of UNK age aspirations and level of UNK were typically involved in politics before the war STOP 
START they did not UNK the war but they fought in it however UNK UNK out some kind of formal education read widely and UNK did not fall into UNK jobs on UNK magazines but they did whatever UNK thing they could get in order to eat found out who they were and what they could do then within the limits of their talent they did it STOP 
START they did not worry about experience because experience thrust itself upon them STOP 
START and they traveled out of new york STOP 
START only a native new UNK could believe that new york is now or ever was a literary center STOP 
START it is a publishing and public relations center but these very facts prevent it from being a literary center because writers dislike UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK consists only in his new UNK view that new york is the world displays what UNK call the new york mind a state that the subject is necessarily unable to perceive in himself STOP 
START the new york mind is two parts abstraction and one part UNK about the rest of the country and in fact the world STOP 
START in his UNK against the literary world krim is really struggling with the new UNK in himself but it's a losing battle STOP 
START closely related to his UNK about his UNK is UNK complicated feeling about his UNK STOP 
START he writes most of my friends and i were jewish were also literary combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the UNK needed to be a writer created in my circle the most UNK and incredible UNK ambition i have ever seen or could ever have imagined STOP 
START within themselves just as people my friends were often UNK and UNK bitter about being the UNK of this UNK UNK breed reading and thinking gave an extension to their normal UNK about appearing jewish in UNK bus UNK movie house any of the public places that used to make the jew of my generation UNK heavy UNK walking across seventh avenue without their glasses on willing to dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the UNK UNK of the UNK intellectual STOP 
START at other points in his narrative krim associates UNK with UNK literary ambition with abstraction with his personal turning aside from the good the true and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of james t. UNK to the international the false and the UNK STOP 
START krim says in short that he is a suffering jew STOP 
START the only possible answer to that is i am a suffering UNK STOP 
START we all love to suffer but some of us love to suffer more than others STOP 
START had krim gone farther from new york than chapel hill he might have discovered that large numbers of american jews do not find his new york version of the UNK lot UNK UNK STOP 
START more important is the simple human point that all men suffer and that it is a kind of UNK pride on the part of the jew to believe that his suffering is more UNK than mine or anyone UNK STOP 
START this is not to deny the existence of UNK and UNK but only to assert that these UNK have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience them that among the various side effects is the local UNK of jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion which they call UNK and pain STOP 
START in their UNK and UNK they believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of UNK and UNK STOP 
START some of us have imagination and UNK too STOP 
START finally there is the UNK fact that some of the finest american fiction is being written by jews but it is not jewish fiction UNK and UNK UNK through intellectual UNK perception through experience in fact have obviously UNK themselves from any sentimental krim UNK they might have been tempted to STOP 
START UNK main attack is upon the aesthetic and the publishing apparatus of american literary culture in our day STOP 
START krim was able to get an advance for a novel and time and opportunity to write at UNK but it was no good STOP 
START i had natural UNK he says as a UNK and was UNK good at description dialogue and most of the other UNK of the UNK trade but i was UNK by a UNK complex of thoughts and feelings that prevented me from doing more than just UNK the surface of sustained UNK STOP 
START and again how can you write when you haven't yet read UNK the UNK came to believe that the novel as a form had UNK its vital meaning STOP 
START his UNK jewish friends convinced him that education read reading was a must STOP 
START he moved in a highly intellectual group in greenwich village in the late UNK becoming UNK overnight STOP 
START then followed a period in which he wrote UNK for the new york times book review the UNK UNK had a small piece in partisan review and moved on to hudson the village voice and UNK STOP 
START the work for UNK was more satisfying than work for UNK because of the UNK UNK fear of making a UNK STOP 
START UNK was a mere suburb of partisan review the UNK STOP 
START both magazines were rigid with reactionary UNK s. UNK UNK STOP 
START partisan has failed krim says for being UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK from the u.s. STOP 
START it was the creation of a monstrous historical period UNK it thought it had to UNK literature and politics and UNK art of every kind with its writers UNK trying to UNK each other in UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and hudson operated in an UNK new critical chill example caused krim and his friends to put on UNK UNK affect all sorts of impressive scholarship and UNK UNK in order to slip through their narrow UNK and get into their pages STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK as the french jewish intellectuals used to say STOP 
START through all this UNK krim is performing a traditional and by now UNK UNK the attack on intelligence upon the largely successful attempt of the magazines he UNK to UNK american writing from local color and other UNK of romantic corn STOP 
START god knows that partisan and the rest often were and remain guilty of intellectual UNK STOP 
START sociological UNK UNK UNK to english UNK but UNK fiction and UNK to common sense have often UNK partisan and in lesser degree the other magazines on the list STOP 
START what krim UNK in his contempt for history and for accuracy is that these magazines partisan foremost brought about a genuine revolution in the american mind from the UNK to approximately 1950 STOP 
START the most obvious characteristic of contemporary american writing apart from the beat nonsense is its UNK STOP 
START the process of UNK had begun in earnest about 1912 but the first war and the depression virtually UNK that process in its tracks STOP 
START without the good magazines without their book UNK their UNK to european writers without above all their awareness of literary standards we might very well have had a generation of UNK heroes UNK UNK UNK and i might add UNK and UNK and UNK in verse and then where would we be UNK and UNK as krim might say after reading a book about UNK STOP 
START when partisan and UNK set up shop UNK was still accepted as an UNK of taste remember UNK george jean UNK and alexander UNK were honored in odd quarters and the whole UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK buck amy UNK william UNK UNK atmosphere lay thick as los angeles UNK over the country STOP 
START politics economics sociology the entire area of life that lies between literature and what krim calls experience UNK needed to be dug into STOP 
START the universities certainly were not doing it nor were the popular magazines of the day STOP 
START this partisan above all did it had never printed a word of literature its contribution to the UNK area would still be historic STOP 
START but it did print good verse and good fiction STOP 
START if the editors sometimes UNK and printed UNK new UNK UNK they also printed malraux UNK UNK UNK UNK robert UNK francis UNK mary UNK UNK UNK UNK elizabeth UNK UNK clark and a host of other good writers STOP 
START partisan review and the other literary magazines helped to UNK in the best sense an entire generation STOP 
START that these magazines also UNK the UNK of the world is unfortunate but inevitable STOP 
START it is a fact of life that magazines are UNK by groups they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all STOP 
START and it is also a fact of life that there will always be UNK UNK people around who will be UNK by the UNK of what looks like a literary movement STOP 
START there are no literary movements there are only writers doing their work STOP 
START literary movements are the creation of UNK who live off writers STOP 
START when krim says mine was as severe a UNK environment as can be imagined he is off his UNK STOP 
START he indicates that he has none of the UNK that criticism requires including education result was his inevitable UNK through ignorance STOP 
START he wasn't being educated in those village UNK as he claims STOP 
START no one was ever educated through UNK in anything other than to quote him again UNK UNK STOP 
START only a new york UNK would expect to find the literary life in greenwich village at any point later than UNK UNK day STOP 
START the highly intellectual minds that krim says he encountered in the village did their work in spite of not because of any village atmosphere STOP 
START but UNK complaint is important because not only in new york but in other cities and in universities throughout this country young and not so young men at this moment are being UNK by UNK ideas STOP 
START those who have quality will UNK the experience rest will turn beat or into UNK or into beat UNK STOP 
START for the sad truth is that while one might write well without having read UNK the UNK one is more likely to write well if one has read it and much else STOP 
START the most UNK aspect of UNK piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic STOP 
START he UNK the UNK only once when he refers to their having UNK through mere power and UNK and the UNK to commit death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression and actual experience but the entire narrative is written in the UNK vocabulary of that lost and dying cause and in the UNK UNK that is supposed to UNK our mother tongue STOP 
START UNK aesthetic UNK UNK conscious and unconscious UNK and a UNK UNK upon the natural and upon experience STOP 
START ideas are the UNK to nowhere STOP 
START my UNK had been strictly literature and UNK enough american literature because that was what i wanted to write STOP 
START he UNK to something called direct writing and he finds that criticism gets in the way of his UNK UNK imaginative UNK STOP

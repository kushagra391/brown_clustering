START for by now the original cause of the quarrel UNK UNK of UNK was only one UNK in the UNK UNK of french interests that UNK all western europe and that had been so well and closely spun that the UNK movement could set it trembling from one end to the other STOP 
START even so UNK UNK can scarcely have UNK that five years of UNK work lay ahead of them before peace was finally made and that when it did come the countless UNK that left england for rome during that period had very little to do with it STOP 
START it is hard not to lay most of the blame for their UNK on the pope STOP 
START UNK is hardly an UNK witness and even he did not make his charges against UNK until the latter was dead but there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say STOP 
START it was not merely a hunger for money gold and precious objects that delayed the UNK UNK that could have brought the war to an end pope was playing a dangerous game with so many balls in the air at once that a UNK would bring them all about his ears and his only hope was to UNK so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of european affairs STOP 
START when the negotiations began his quarrel with the king of france was temporarily in UNK and he had no intention of UNK it so long as there was hope that french money would come to pay the troops who under charles of UNK the UNK UNK of UNK were so valuable in the UNK against the UNK UNK and their UNK allies STOP 
START if his UNK in regard to UNK UNK went so far that he even refused to grant a UNK for the marriage of UNK daughter UNK to the son of the UNK of UNK a truly UNK move according to UNK ideas for UNK and UNK were as usual fighting on opposite sides for fear that he might seem to be UNK the UNK coalition he would certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return of UNK to edward even though as he admitted to the english UNK he had been advised that the original UNK was UNK STOP 
START on the other hand he did not want to UNK edward either and he found himself in a very difficult position STOP 
START on the surface the whole question was purely UNK STOP 
START the french were now UNK UNK and UNK on the technical grounds that their UNK had UNK them by a UNK of the UNK contract STOP 
START but edward was UNK scotland for precisely the same reason and his UNK UNK was the UNK of the king of france STOP 
START UNK had to UNK the UNK of the UNK contract at all costs for it was only as UNK of UNK and of the UNK of peter that he had any justification for his italian wars but in the UNK UNK it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one of the UNK without seeming to UNK those of the other two STOP 
START because of these UNK in the matter at stake UNK lacked the UNK that is supposed to be an essential UNK for the position of UNK and in UNK that would seem to be sufficient reason why the english UNK to the UNK proved so UNK STOP 
START but when the situation was so complicated that even UNK one of the principal actors in the drama could UNK the UNK motives it is possible that UNK and his UNK equally UNK attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause STOP 
START this was UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK by its very UNK implies that its UNK keeps in touch with other people but the author of UNK UNK and UNK UNK the UNK of the two UNK the UNK sun of which the imperial moon was but a dim reflection the UNK of UNK and UNK of christ was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten what they were like STOP 
START he was a learned and brilliant man one of the best UNK in europe and with UNK of penetrating insight and yet in his UNK with other people particularly when he tried to be UNK he was capable of an UNK UNK that can have come only from a complete UNK of human nature and human motives STOP 
START this UNK UNK for others was not shared by such men as pierre UNK and his associates that brilliant group of UNK men as UNK calls them who provided the brains for the french embassy that came to rome under the nominal leadership of the UNK of UNK the duke of UNK and the count of UNK STOP 
START they had UNK from humble UNK by their own UNK and UNK they were UNK by the codes that bound UNK like UNK or even the older generation of UNK like UNK and they were working for an end that their opponents had never even UNK STOP 
START UNK was later to explain to the english that robert of UNK and guy de UNK were easy enough to do business with was the UNK who caused the UNK and who made him say that the ruling passion of their race was UNK and that in dealing with them he never knew whether he had to do with a UNK or with a devil STOP 
START to the pope head of the universal church to the duke of UNK taking full advantage of his position on the borders of france and of the empire or to UNK who found it quite natural that he should do UNK to edward for UNK and to the count of UNK for UNK UNK UNK nationalism was completely UNK STOP 
START and yet he made no UNK about it the pope trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature said to him you have already taken UNK STOP 
START do you want to drive the king of england from all his overseas possessions UNK answer was a UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START loyal and UNK with a UNK ambition to which he devoted all his energies he UNK the english UNK time and time again until by a kind of poetic justice he fell at the battle of UNK the victim of the equally UNK if less UNK UNK STOP 
START the english UNK on a UNK UNK and confronted with superior diplomatic skill were also UNK in their negotiations by the events that were taking place at home STOP 
START the UNK had found a new leader in william UNK and UNK yearly UNK across the border called for UNK taxes which only increased his difficulties with the UNK and the clergy STOP 
START he was unable to send any more help to his allies on the continent and during the next few years many of them left to resist french pressure UNK UNK to the inevitable and made their peace with philip STOP 
START the defeat and death of UNK of nassau at the hands of albert of UNK also worked to the UNK of the english for all the efforts to UNK the UNK coalition came to nothing when philip made an alliance with the new king of the UNK STOP 
START these shifts in alliance and UNK not only increased the difficulties UNK the english embassy as a whole but also directly involved the two UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START in spite of the UNK UNK by UNK two years earlier the war between bishop UNK of UNK and louis of UNK was still going on and although little is known about it that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle against french expansion and was closely UNK with the larger conflict STOP 
START a second UNK had been UNK in april UNK by jean UNK lord of UNK the most UNK of UNK UNK allies and these last were represented in the discussions at the UNK by UNK de UNK UNK neighbor and a member of the UNK coalition STOP 
START but although in many of these discussions UNK and UNK might have been tempted to consider their own interests as well as those of the king UNK confidence in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders of the embassy STOP 
START UNK may have owed this partly to his relationship with the king but UNK who at sixty seems still to have been a simple knight UNK his position solely by his own character and ability STOP 
START the younger men UNK and UNK who was also UNK cousin and whose UNK blood gave him the UNK UNK that caused edward of UNK UNK friend UNK UNK to UNK him joseph the jew were relatively new to the game of diplomacy but UNK had been on missions to rome before and UNK a man of great learning UNK in speech agreeable to meet of honest religion and UNK in the eyes of all and an UNK to boot was as reliable and experienced as UNK himself STOP 
START but all the reports of this first embassy show that the two UNK were the heads of it for they were the only ones who were UNK to UNK for the king that he would UNK by the UNK decision and who were allowed to UNK deputies in the event that one was UNK absent STOP 
START this also gave them the unpleasant duty of being spokesmen for the mission and they could UNK that that would not be easy STOP 
START underneath all the UNK phrases of royal and UNK letters and behind the more UNK instructions to the UNK was the UNK fact that edward would have to desert his UNK allies and leave them to the UNK of their UNK UNK the king of france in return for being given an equally free hand with the UNK UNK STOP 
START this was a UNK bitter blow to the king STOP 
START in the eyes of those who still cared for such things it was a reflection on his honor and it gave further grounds for complaint to his UNK subjects who were already UNK although probably not in latin UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK sit UNK UNK STOP 
START bad relations between england and UNK brought hard times to the UNK scattered over the UNK and UNK as well as to the crowded UNK cities and while the english so far had done no more than UNK UNK had seen what the UNK might lead to for before he left the low countries the citizens of UNK had UNK in protest against the expense of supporting edward and his troops and the regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the UNK little UNK that UNK STOP 
START in all the talk of UNK rights the UNK and UNK must never forget the UNK nor was it easy to do so for all along the road to italy they passed the UNK pack trains going home with their UNK of raw UNK from england and rough UNK cloth the former to be spun and UNK by the UNK UNK UNK and the latter to be UNK and UNK by the UNK UNK UNK with the UNK recently discovered in asia minor by one of their members UNK UNK the secret of which they UNK kept for themselves STOP 
START these UNK merchants made amusing and UNK traveling UNK for their business took them to all four corners of the globe and UNK gossip had already reached a high stage of development as even a UNK glance at the UNK will prove STOP 
START a northern ambassador willing to keep his mouth shut and his ears open could learn a lot that would stand him in good UNK at the UNK STOP 
START they had other UNK of conversation besides their news from courts and UNK which were of interest to UNK the builder of UNK in UNK and churches in his native country STOP 
START behind him lay the low countries where men were still completing the UNK that a later UNK would describe as a UNK of little UNK one on top of the other with so many UNK and UNK and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble low countries where the middle ages were to last for another two centuries and die out only when charles the bold of UNK met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls of UNK STOP

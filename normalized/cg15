START it is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious UNK compound UNK but UNK significant for UNK work STOP 
START the wife UNK and her lover are both UNK UNK she as UNK UNK UNK and UNK possibly a UNK maker with a kind of UNK UNK to set against her apparent simplicity her UNK brain STOP 
START UNK for his part belonged to the present-day race of small artists who do not demand the UNK of themselves and the bitter description of the type includes such UNK as UNK little UNK the UNK indictment they do not know how to be UNK UNK and in order and the somewhat extreme UNK so far not fulfilled they will be destroyed STOP 
START the trick these two play upon UNK reveals their want not simply of UNK but of imagination as well STOP 
START his appearance as UNK UNK not UNK but horror in the audience is a spectacle absolutely painful an UNK of the suffering flesh UNK by spirit UNK by any spirit other than UNK and UNK STOP 
START at the same time the multiple UNK involved the fat man as girl and as baby as UNK pretending to be a baby touches for a moment UNK upon the secret sources of a life like UNK upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life STOP 
START the music which UNK has composed for this episode is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly UNK STOP 
START but it is characteristic of him we are told his little UNK to be able to introduce into a fairly UNK and humorous piece of UNK a sudden phrase of genuine creative art STOP 
START and this occurs now at the UNK of UNK song at the point in fact of the name UNK UNK described as almost a stroke of genius STOP 
START a miracle a revelation it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude STOP 
START it is this UNK which reveals to UNK his own UNK UNK and simultaneously his wife's UNK STOP 
START by the same means he UNK this fact as having UNK itself to the audience UNK and dies STOP 
START in the work of every artist i suppose there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive ultimately UNK of what it is all about less UNK so for being mysterious as though some deeply hidden UNK of thoughts were UNK in a single image a single moment STOP 
START so here STOP 
START the UNK humor the specifically sexual UNK of the joke gone wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a UNK dressing up as a baby UNK of that UNK flesh bringing together around it of the secret UNK between UNK UNK UNK and sharp UNK talent UNK with an occasional touch of genius which however does not know how to attack the problem of suffering UNK way in which music revelation and death are associated in a single instant all this seems a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself itself also it UNK numerous and distant UNK from the entire body of UNK work STOP 
START when i try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance i come up with the following ideas which i shall express very briefly here and UNK to in a later essay STOP 
START love is the crucial dilemma of experience for UNK heroes STOP 
START the dramatic construction of his stories UNK turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love STOP 
START the release the freedom involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible the motion toward it brings disaster STOP 
START this prohibition on love has an especially UNK relation to art is particularly the artist UNK UNK UNK UNK who UNK from it STOP 
START the specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the UNK in the realm of art STOP 
START again the UNK and UNK produced by any UNK against the UNK not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood with the figure of a child STOP 
START finally the theatrical and UNK UNK notions of dressing up UNK UNK and especially change of UNK or UNK of UNK as with UNK are UNK associated with the UNK of UNK stories STOP 
START we shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them UNK STOP 
START for the present it is enough to note that in the UNK figure of UNK at the moment of his UNK all these elements come together in UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK a lawyer that is to say associated with dignity reserve discipline with much that is essentially middle-class he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up disguised that is paradoxically revealed as a child and worse as a UNK UNK as a child STOP 
START that this UNK takes place on a stage during an artistic performance is enough to associate UNK with art and to bring down upon him the punishment for art is he is suspect guilty UNK as is anyone in UNK stories who produces illusion and this is true even though the constant elements of the UNK technique magic guilt and suffering are divided in this story between UNK and UNK STOP 
START it appears that the dominant tendency of UNK early tales however UNK or even UNK the surface is already toward the symbolic the UNK the UNK STOP 
START in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same STOP 
START something of this can be learned from the way to the UNK UNK an UNK about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing UNK causes him to die of a stroke or UNK STOP 
START there is no more plot than that slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident would give STOP 
START the artistic interest then lies in what the encounter may be made to represent in the power of some central significance to draw the details into UNK and UNK STOP 
START the first sentence with its UNK irony UNK an UNK intent the way to the UNK ran along beside the UNK ran beside it all the way to the end is to say to the UNK STOP 
START and the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction STOP 
START the UNK one might say at first belongs to life while the way to the UNK belongs to death STOP 
START but that is too simple and won't hold up STOP 
START as the first sentence suggests both roads belong to death in the end STOP 
START but the UNK according to the description of its traffic belongs to life as it is lived in UNK of death while the way to the UNK belongs to some other sort of life a suffering form an existence wholly UNK in the awareness of death STOP 
START thus on the UNK a troop of soldiers UNK in their own dust and sang while on the UNK one man walks alone STOP 
START this man's isolation is not merely UNK it is permanent STOP 
START he is a UNK his three children are dead he has no one left on earth he is a drunk and has lost his job on that account STOP 
START his name is UNK piepsam and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and UNK in a way which UNK him to a sinister type in the UNK UNK he is a UNK of those UNK UNK in death in UNK for example who represent some combination of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START this strange person UNK with a UNK because the latter is using the path rather than the UNK STOP 
START the UNK a sufficiently commonplace young fellow is not named but identified simply as life that and a license number which piepsam uses in UNK him STOP 
START life points out that everybody uses this path and starts to ride on STOP 
START piepsam tries to stop him by force receives a push in the chest from life and is left standing in UNK and growing rage while a crowd begins to gather STOP 
START his rage UNK a religious form is on the basis of his own UNK and UNK UNK piepsam becomes a UNK who in his UNK and in the name of god UNK UNK on life not only the UNK now but the audience the world as well all you UNK breed STOP 
START this passion brings on a fit which proves fatal STOP 
START then an UNK comes along and they drive UNK piepsam away STOP 
START this is simple enough but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant STOP 
START the season between spring and summer belongs to life in its UNK aspect STOP 
START UNK fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the UNK but also because god will not stop him piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments his justice is not of this world STOP 
START life is further characterized in UNK to piepsam as animal the image of a dog which appears at several places is first given as the criterion of UNK irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle a dog in a wagon is UNK a pleasure to UNK wagon has no dog and therefore is UNK of interest STOP 
START piepsam calls the UNK UNK and UNK among other things and at the crisis of his fit a little UNK stands before him and UNK into his face STOP 
START the UNK is drawn by two charming little horses STOP 
START piepsam is not certainly religious in any conventional sense STOP 
START his UNK is UNK or UNK connected with his UNK two may in fact be identical STOP 
START his UNK UNK to give up drink are represented as religious UNK keeps a bottle in a UNK at home and before this UNK UNK piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees and in his UNK had UNK his tongue and still in the end UNK STOP 
START the UNK by contrast blond and UNK is simply UNK UNK life UNK and UNK STOP 
START he made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth STOP 
START piepsam is UNK a disturbing UNK end is ridiculous and trivial STOP 
START he is a man UNK mad on the way to the UNK STOP 
START but he is more interesting than the others the ones who come from the UNK to watch him more interesting than life considered as a UNK STOP 
START and if i have gone into so much detail about so small a work that is because it is also so typical a work representing the UNK form of a conflict which remains essential in UNK writing the crude sketch of piepsam contains in its critical destructive and UNK UNK much that is UNK and illuminated in the figures of for instance UNK and UNK STOP 
START in method as well as in theme this little UNK with its details selected as much for UNK and UNK as for realism UNK a kind of musical composition as well as a kind of fictional composition in which as UNK says there shall be nothing UNK STOP 
START it UNK too pictures such as UNK and UNK did in which all that looks at first to be solely UNK proves on inspection to be also literary the representation of a UNK for example or a deadly sin STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK the way to the UNK in its representation of a conflict between light and dark between life and a spirit of criticism UNK UNK but it goes considerably further in UNK the elements of this conflict STOP 
START the monk UNK brought over from the renaissance and placed against the background of UNK at the turn of the century protests against the UNK works displayed in the UNK of m. UNK particular against a UNK UNK in a UNK style and UNK according to gossip upon the UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK like piepsam makes his protest quite in UNK and his rejection though not fatal is ridiculous and UNK is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter STOP 
START on the street outside UNK UNK a UNK of the UNK of this world such a burning of artistic and UNK UNK as his UNK actually brought to pass in UNK and UNK he issues his curse UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK et UNK STOP

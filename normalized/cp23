START under normal circumstances he had a certain UNK UNK charm with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs STOP 
START today he looked like an UNK who had left his UNK UNK on the bureau and spent six months in space hollow eyes hollow cheeks hollow stomach STOP 
START breakfast he thought STOP 
START a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better STOP 
START he looked around his little UNK bureau bed table chair UNK stove STOP 
START then he remembered STOP 
START you share a refrigerator mrs. UNK had said and somehow at midnight after the long drive from new york in UNK rain that had sounded reasonable STOP 
START in the cold light of day it seemed a UNK arrangement STOP 
START share bath maybe but share refrigerator had explained it something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units STOP 
START and where was the thing remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small store of UNK UNK STOP 
START ah yes his half of a refrigerator stood outside on the UNK UNK between unit number three and unit number four STOP 
START it was still UNK and mrs. UNK UNK UNK through the gray UNK like the names they bore vivid blue and green and UNK STOP 
START charlie UNK his orange juice and one of the long UNK green UNK his spirits as damp as the day STOP 
START this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had prescribed it STOP 
START take a full month the doctor had said STOP 
START lots of sun lots of rest STOP 
START the red UNK are a UNK compound STOP 
START this is a sleeping UNK STOP 
START the others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it UNK STOP 
START you young men get to be my age you won't take UNK so lightly STOP 
START charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment STOP 
START the doctor could call it anything from UNK to UNK charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew too that there was no pill to cure it STOP 
START he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and had caught a bear of a cold by UNK the bride UNK forever which was really UNK it on STOP 
START he had caught too like an UNK a confirmed UNK of women STOP 
START once burned UNK really because vivian had given him every encouragement forever shy STOP 
START from now on his was going to be a man's world the north woods UNK UNK at UNK beer and UNK and male UNK STOP 
START meanwhile he had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching the rain make UNK UNK at his feet the doctor's UNK for lots of sun seemed like a hollow UNK STOP 
START in these damp circumstances he was an UNK bet to develop UNK STOP 
START he looked up to see mrs. UNK UNK in a UNK UNK UNK bearing down on him STOP 
START UNK blow UNK UNK STOP 
START he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really UNK weather as a kind of UNK victory over the tourists STOP 
START fine day after tomorrow she added STOP 
START i hope so he said STOP 
START i've got this cold STOP 
START thought i'd bake it out in the sun STOP 
START ah STOP 
START she studied him briefly STOP 
START you've got a UNK look STOP 
START better get in out of the wet STOP 
START charlie UNK to mention that the wet was somewhat universal UNK being less than UNK STOP 
START as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian lost to him forever STOP 
START he could imagine her at this minute UNK in nassau with UNK UNK on golden UNK looking forward to a life of UNK UNK STOP 
START all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a UNK UNK for lunch and a lonely old age if he lived that long STOP 
START he UNK through the light reading provided by mrs. UNK for her guests four separate adventures of the UNK twins at the UNK at the mountains on the farm and in danger and several agricultural UNK on the treatment of UNK disease in cattle UNK illustrated STOP 
START he UNK only to dream of vivian and woke only to crash into the night table UNK his other UNK STOP 
START he took a yellow pill only to UNK on it and went for the UNK only to find something alive in the refrigerator something pink and UNK STOP 
START his first thought was that mrs. UNK in her UNK for color had UNK a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in on further investigation the thing proved to be a sweater of the UNK variety that UNK onto men's UNK pale pale pink and according to the label size UNK STOP 
START he thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the UNK bread and a UNK onion and put the whole thing out of his mind STOP 
START next morning he found a note in the refrigerator STOP 
START would you mind UNK your onion this note STOP 
START the smell UNK everything being the sweater a UNK case and a UNK bottle of UNK UNK pink hand UNK STOP 
START the note paper was pink too and the UNK small and UNK and utterly UNK STOP 
START not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol STOP 
START he UNK sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his better judgment added don't you eat didn't want to encourage anything here on the other hand he didn't want her UNK his UNK STOP 
START not UNK came the answer the following day STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered UNK just why she kept the sweater UNK STOP 
START but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic or common sense STOP 
START take vivian STOP 
START yes take vivian STOP 
START somebody had STOP 
START now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink STOP 
START they would be black or white or UNK UNK UNK and UNK like vivian herself STOP 
START pink vivian once had told him was for baby girls and UNK girls who wore pink were UNK UNK to their infancy STOP 
START why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator UNK aloud STOP 
START UNK was mrs. UNK making her UNK way along the UNK UNK with a UNK collection of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START what's that you say oh nothing STOP 
START just glad the UNK stopped STOP 
START oh yes STOP 
START just look at that sky STOP 
START be a UNK by afternoon STOP 
START i hope so STOP 
START i've got this cold STOP 
START so you said STOP 
START she UNK him STOP 
START my you're UNK STOP 
START you want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash first sunny day STOP 
START i must remember to warn the girl next to you in UNK STOP 
START that pale UNK the worst STOP 
START that pale kind charlie thought STOP 
START hardly an UNK description STOP 
START but then neither was UNK STOP 
START he could hear mrs. UNK now warning her pale guest against UNK STOP 
START i spoke to the fellow next door too she might say STOP 
START he's that UNK kind STOP 
START surely there was a better word STOP 
START charlie looked in the mirror STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START he looked more closely STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START clearly two damp days with the UNK twins had done him no good STOP 
START the sun UNK hot as UNK was far from kind to mrs. UNK UNK properties STOP 
START when charlie came up from the beach for his UNK pill the whole establishment UNK enough when seen through mist and fog looked like a UNK modern painting great blocks of UNK color UNK at regular intervals by the UNK white of five community UNK STOP 
START this weekend he thought he would look around for some more UNK retreat with cape UNK maybe at the door STOP 
START he could not imagine a UNK being brave enough to grow beside UNK UNK and the rest STOP 
START the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes STOP 
START no wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes STOP 
START he got a red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his UNK to her side of the refrigerator and UNK be my guest on the UNK STOP 
START it gave him a good feeling STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START thanks was her answer the next day STOP 
START the note was UNK against his pill bottles and bore a UNK you're not at all well are you i've got this cold he wrote STOP 
START not that it was any of her business STOP 
START it's none of my business said the next note but my aunt UNK used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold and she lived to be UNK STOP 
START i mean she's still living and she's UNK STOP 
START why don't you try that i don't have a lemon STOP 
START he had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the UNK of paper STOP 
START by the next morning she had turned the paper over STOP 
START UNK neither do i STOP 
START charlie grinned STOP 
START she didn't sound like a pale girl STOP 
START she sounded a little like a UNK STOP 
START but then UNK are often pale STOP 
START he stuck his head in mrs. UNK little rental office STOP 
START i guess that UNK next to me took your advice STOP 
START i haven't seen her on the beach STOP 
START you won't if you're looking for a UNK STOP 
START she's got UNK hair STOP 
START he spent that afternoon on the beach looking for a pale UNK girl in a pink bathing suit STOP 
START there were pink bathing suits on UNK and UNK girls in red or black or green bathing suits STOP 
START there were a UNK of daring UNK and a UNK of UNK tank suits STOP 
START up on a UNK he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp UNK before an UNK and absorbed in her painting STOP 
START he paid little attention to her because she was a UNK and because she was wearing white one of those UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START on the beach there were pale girls and UNK girls STOP 
START and he saw them all as he walked up and down STOP 
START at two that morning he was still walking up and down UNK up and down the UNK up and down the silent UNK beach STOP 
START finally in UNK he opened the refrigerator UNK her hand UNK and left a note STOP 
START i've got this UNK said the note and i used some of your hand UNK STOP 
START hope you don't mind STOP 
START of course i don't mind she answered STOP 
START you're having a miserable time aren't you all the UNK you want and for UNK sake stay in out of the sun for a couple of days STOP 
START this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided STOP 
START sympathy is a fine quality in a woman STOP 
START now vivian for instance was not too long on sympathy STOP 
START she felt and said that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own STOP 
START he didn't know what was so tough about UNK world UNK around nassau with UNK STOP 
START suppose UNK got a UNK couldn't see vivian offering any hand UNK STOP 
START she might UNK him once the worst of the UNK was over STOP 
START charlie spent the next two days in his UNK UNK waiting for the fire in his back to UNK and used generous quantities of the hand UNK STOP 
START correspondence passed back and forth STOP 
START UNK your UNK now only thing this UNK has UNK in it and that UNK the skin so if you're so anxious to get a UNK you may not want to use it STOP 
START i'm not that anxious but maybe that's why you're so fair STOP 
START that mrs. UNK bet she told you i was UNK too STOP 
START UNK your cold UNK out STOP 
START she didn't say you were UNK STOP 
START are you UNK UNK goes with pale and UNK STOP 
START do you have anything to read while you're shut up are two things here about surviving in the wilderness and a book called tom swift and his UNK UNK the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister STOP 
START also the UNK STOP

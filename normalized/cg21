START american democratic thought pointed up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion which he called the american democratic faith STOP 
START those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the UNK of the democratic faith at around UNK STOP 
START and he describes it as a balanced UNK between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law STOP 
START i want to say more about UNK so-called fundamental law STOP 
START but first i want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it STOP 
START he points out that from the time of jackson on through world war 1 UNK protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of america STOP 
START he terms this early enthusiasm romantic christianity and UNK that its UNK to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its UNK in UNK protestantism STOP 
START let me quote him even more fully for his analysis is important to my theme STOP 
START he says beside the protestant philosophy of progress as expressed in radical or conservative UNK should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which UNK it to be the duty of the destiny of the united states to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the UNK of democracy STOP 
START he UNK in the middle period of the nineteenth century it was colored by christian UNK in the twentieth century it was affected by UNK STOP 
START but in every period it has been UNK STOP 
START and let me add UNK also STOP 
START some fourteen or fifteen years ago in an essay i called the leader follows where used his UNK to illustrate what i thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call UNK STOP 
START it seemed to me that the liberals had UNK the balanced UNK and UNK both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man STOP 
START that is to say UNK fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more STOP 
START it is a weakness of UNK analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy STOP 
START and with UNK the religion of humanity was UNK what gabriel called christian UNK STOP 
START and the common man was developing UNK power or UNK on his own STOP 
START during the decade that followed the common man as that piece put it grew uncomfortable as the voice of god and fled from behind saint UNK wilson only to learn from science to his shocked relief that after all there was no god he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow that there was a chemical formula for him and that too much couldn't be expected of him STOP 
START the socialism implicit in the UNK of the roosevelt revolution freedom from want and fear seems a far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution or of the UNK frontier STOP 
START what had happened to the common man UNK had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK of UNK after the war for southern independence and the general secular drift to the religion of humanity however prepared the way for a reception of the french UNK UNK UNK of one sort of another STOP 
START the first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under wilson STOP 
START moreover the UNK of our economy during the UNK the UNK of the depression the common UNK of UNK everywhere all contributed in various ways to the UNK that replaced mike UNK and the great UNK with the anonymous UNK of the little people STOP 
START however it is important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former STOP 
START that john UNK philosophy of the social contract UNK the american revolution with its declaration of independence i believe we generally accept STOP 
START yet after rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the general will the same philosophy it may be said became the idea source of the french revolution also STOP 
START the importance of UNK twist has not always been clear to us however STOP 
START this notion of the general will gave rise to the UNK of paris in the revolution and later brought UNK to dictatorship STOP 
START and it is clearly argued by lord UNK of UNK in his remarkable long essay the UNK of democracy and in a more general way by UNK in his new science of politics that this same UNK idea UNK through european democracy is the source of UNK theory of the dictatorship of the UNK STOP 
START this is important to understanding the position that UNK liberals found themselves in after world war 2 and our great democratic victory that brought no peace STOP 
START the long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy into a worship of man led logically to the UNK dream of a UNK society under a socialist state STOP 
START and the UNK existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism the ultimate UNK STOP 
START and by the time the war ended liberal leadership in this country was UNK UNK STOP 
START we will recall that the still confident liberals of the truman administration gathered with other western UNK in san francisco to set up the legal framework finally and at last to UNK war to UNK want and fear out of the world the united nations STOP 
START we of the UNK world got all set for peace and rehabilitation STOP 
START then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight an UNK an UNK an UNK and UNK war with our strongest and some had thought UNK UNK STOP 
START during the next five years the leaders of the fair deal UNK backed down from the optimistic expectations of the new deal STOP 
START during the next five years liberal leaders in the united states sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and UNK in a negative policy of UNK and the UNK irony enforced and UNK only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest UNK for but could not abandon the atom bomb STOP 
START in 1952 it will be remembered the UNK without positive program UNK on the popular UNK with liberal leadership and won UNK STOP 
START all of this i know is recent history familiar to you STOP 
START but i have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man to point up what happened to him under eisenhower's leadership STOP 
START a UNK UNK sam UNK has UNK it in the title of one of his books as the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START he opens his UNK however with a review of the eisenhower UNK UNK at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents all UNK to catch some revelation of the emerging new age STOP 
START the show was colorful indeed UNK but the press for all its UNK could UNK no note of a UNK UNK with destiny STOP 
START UNK offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue STOP 
START and i select this sentence as its pertinent UNK in essence the drama of his eisenhower's presidency can be described as the UNK of a nation turned conservative and struggling thus far with but limited and UNK success to give effective voice and force to that UNK STOP 
START i will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle with its limited and UNK success toward UNK STOP 
START it has moved on various levels it has been UNK and confused STOP 
START obviously there has been no agreement on what american UNK is or rather what it should be STOP 
START for it was neglected not to say UNK when the struggle began STOP 
START i saw a piece the other day UNK william UNK author of man and god at yale and UNK of the national review as no conservative at all but an old liberal STOP 
START i would agree with this view STOP 
START but i'm not here to define UNK STOP 
START what i am here to do is to report on the UNK of the struggle a struggle that amounts to UNK to see if we can UNK its future course STOP 
START one of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election i suppose is that we the majority were UNK with eisenhower UNK STOP 
START though to be sure we gave kennedy no very positive approval in the UNK of his UNK STOP 
START this is however UNK of our national UNK STOP 
START but before i try to UNK it i would offer other evidence STOP 
START i will mention two volumes of specific comment on this UNK that appeared last year STOP 
START the earlier of them was an UNK enterprise sponsored by life magazine under the title of the national purpose STOP 
START the UNK to this testament were all well-known a former democratic candidate for president a new deal poet the UNK chief editorial writer two newspaper UNK head of a national UNK company a popular protestant UNK etc. STOP 
START what i want to point out here is that all of them are UNK or modified liberals with perhaps one exception STOP 
START i suppose we might UNK billy graham as an old liberal STOP 
START and i would further note that they all with one exception again sang in one key or another the same song STOP 
START its UNK was let us return to the UNK democracy of our UNK for our salvation STOP 
START UNK stevenson expressed some UNK about this return STOP 
START others UNK technology and common sense STOP 
START only walter UNK UNK the possibility of our having UNK most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes STOP 
START but the most notable thing about the UNK of these UNK was that the UNK UNK of socialism was UNK absent STOP 
START the second specific comment was the report of eisenhower's commission on national goals titled goals for americans STOP 
START they perhaps gave the pitch of their position in the UNK where it was said that eisenhower requested that the commission be administered by the american assembly of columbia university because it was UNK STOP 
START the commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal but not unconscious enough to UNK the now UNK UNK of socialism STOP 
START and here again we hear the same UNK mentioned above the UNK goal of the united states set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual UNK his development UNK his opportunity STOP 
START this group is UNK and their program tends to be technological STOP 
START but it is the need to undertake these UNK that i would submit here as UNK of the common man's UNK STOP 
START and let me add UNK new book as another UNK of it particularly so in view of the attention time magazine gave it when it came out recently STOP 
START father UNK goes back to the declaration of independence too though i may add with considerably more historical perception STOP 
START i will reserve discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy STOP 
START as UNK of the common man's UNK he is most significant a liberal and a catholic elected by the skin of his teeth STOP 
START does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy not to say confused state of the public mind is the common man's complaint take a UNK look back over the course we have come STOP 
START has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under eisenhower the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic STOP 
START ralph gabriel gave it the name of protestant philosophy of progress STOP 
START but there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook STOP

START i do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are UNK in the sense that everyone agrees with them STOP 
START if they were walter UNK would be writing the same columns as george UNK and UNK lock would have nothing to draw UNK about STOP 
START i do mean however that i take them for granted and that everything i shall be saying would appear quite UNK against any contrary assumptions STOP 
START assumption 1 STOP 
START -hlthe ultimate objective of american policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity in particular since this is our special responsibility that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the united states STOP 
START i speak of the largest possible measure because any person who UNK that these conditions can be UNK and perfectly achieved ever UNK without the inherent UNK of himself and his fellow human beings and is therefore a dangerous man to have around STOP 
START assumption 2 STOP 
START UNK conditions are UNK are not even UNK in the qualified sense i have indicated without the prior defeat of world communism STOP 
START this is true for two reasons because communism is both UNK and in practice UNK to these conditions because communists have the will and as long as soviet power remains intact the capacity to prevent their realization STOP 
START moreover as communist power increases the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world UNK pro UNK and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote STOP 
START assumption 3 STOP 
START -hlit follows that victory over communism is the dominant UNK goal of american policy STOP 
START UNK in the sense that there are more distant more positive ends we seek to which victory over communism is but a means STOP 
START but dominant in the sense that every other objective no matter how worthy UNK must UNK to it STOP 
START peace is a worthy objective if we must choose between peace and keeping the communists out of berlin then we must fight STOP 
START freedom in the sense of UNK is a worthy objective if UNK UNK to the UNK rebels UNK sweeping that area into the UNK orbit then UNK freedom must be UNK STOP 
START justice is a worthy objective if justice for UNK UNK driving the government of the union of south africa away from the west then the UNK must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer STOP 
START prosperity is a worthy objective if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist communist UNK then material UNK and UNK will have to be made STOP 
START it may be of course that such objectives can be pursued UNK with a policy designed to UNK communism point is that where UNK arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a UNK world the absence of soviet communist power STOP 
START the uses of power this much having been said the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do defeat communism and if so how those resources ought to be used STOP 
START this brings us squarely to the problem of power and the uses a nation makes of power STOP 
START i submit that this is the key problem of international relations that it always has been that it always will be STOP 
START and i suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of american UNK ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945 to deal with this problem UNK and seriously STOP 
START in the recent political campaign two charges were leveled UNK the question of power and i think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus STOP 
START one was UNK false other for the most part true STOP 
START the first was that america had become or was in danger of becoming a UNK military power STOP 
START i know i do not have to UNK here on the UNK of that UNK STOP 
START you may have UNK about certain aspects of our military establishment i certainly do but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength finds the united states not only superior but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of UNK relations for the UNK future STOP 
START i have often UNK for a UNK way of UNK our superiority on those americans who have doubts and i think mr. UNK UNK has done it well in his new book american might and soviet myth STOP 
START suppose he says that the tables were turned and we were in the UNK position there would be more than UNK modern soviet fighters all better than ours UNK at 250 bases in mexico and the UNK STOP 
START overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast STOP 
START half of the population of the u.s. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people STOP 
START add this to the UNK in the countries around us where UNK peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity STOP 
START add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep UNK of the soviets even in the missile field which is UNK to be our main strength STOP 
START if we look at the situation this way we can get an idea of khrushchev's UNK worries or at least of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to UNK their advantage STOP 
START u.s. prestige the other charge was that america's political position in the world has UNK UNK in recent years STOP 
START the UNK needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign but once that has been done i fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it STOP 
START the argument was typically advanced in terms of u.s. prestige STOP 
START prestige however is only a minor part of the problem even then it is a concept that can be highly UNK STOP 
START prestige is a measure of how other people think of you well or ill STOP 
START but contrary to what was implied during the campaign prestige is surely not important for its own sake STOP 
START only the UNK and UNK sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be STOP 
START the thing to lose sleep over is what people having concluded that we are UNK than we are are likely to do about it STOP 
START the evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the united states is UNK than the soviet union and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead STOP 
START this ignorant estimate i repeat is not of any interest in itself it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do namely by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side STOP 
START to the extent then that UNK u.s. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their UNK on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet UNK there is reason for concern STOP 
START still these UNK about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves STOP 
START here i do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power of influence if you will about which the relevant questions are is soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago is western influence greater or less than it used to be gains in answering these questions we need to ask not merely whether communist troops have crossed over into UNK they did not occupy before and not merely whether disciplined agents of the UNK are in control of governments from which they were formerly UNK the success of UNK war against the west does not depend on such spectacular and UNK UNK STOP 
START success may mean merely the displacement of western influence STOP 
START communist political warfare we must remember is UNK UNK and in deliberate stages STOP 
START fearful of UNK a military UNK with the west which they could not win the communists seek to UNK western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant in UNK guerrilla UNK in UNK UNK in the streets in UNK in UNK meetings of UNK UNK at the united nations on the propaganda front at diplomatic conferences preferably at the highest level STOP 
START the soviets understand moreover that the first step in turning a country toward communism is to turn it against the west STOP 
START thus typically the first stage of a communist UNK is to UNK a country STOP 
START the second stage is to retain the nominal classification of UNK while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and UNK of soviet policy STOP 
START and this may be as far as the process will go STOP 
START the UNK goal is the isolation and capture not of UNK but of the united states and this purpose may be served very well by countries that UNK under a UNK UNK yet in fact are UNK UNK of the soviet foreign office STOP 
START to UNK the UNK of recent soviet successes is hardly UNK STOP 
START six years ago french UNK though in UNK was in the western camp STOP 
START today northern UNK is UNK communist is UNK between communism and UNK UNK is for all practical purposes UNK STOP 
START UNK in the early days of the republic leaned toward the west STOP 
START today UNK government is heavily UNK by UNK communists and for all of its UNK UNK it is a firm UNK of soviet policy STOP 
START UNK has moved from a pro-western orientation to a UNK openly hostile to the west STOP 
START in the middle east UNK UNK and egypt were a short while ago in the western camp STOP 
START today the UNK and UNK governments are UNK hostile to the west are dependent for their military power on soviet equipment and personnel almost every particular follow the UNK foreign policy line STOP 
START a short time ago all africa was a western preserve STOP 
START never mind whether the UNK and the UNK enjoyed UNK UNK the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the west STOP 
START today africa is UNK violently away from the west and UNK it would seem into the soviet orbit STOP 
START latin america was once an area as safe for the west as UNK was for nixon STOP 
START today it is up for UNK STOP 
START one latin american country cuba has become a soviet UNK ninety miles off our coast STOP 
START in some countries the trend has gone further than others mexico UNK and UNK are UNK open sympathy for UNK and there is no country save the dominican republic whose funeral services we recently arranged where UNK and UNK does not prevent the government from UNK UNK the american cause STOP 
START only in europe have our lines remained firm and there only on the surface STOP 
START the UNK of UNK are running strong notably in england and even in germany STOP 
START opportunities missed what have we to show by way of UNK have had opportunities clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the iron curtain STOP 
START there was the UNK revolution which we praised and UNK but did nothing about STOP 
START there was the polish revolution which we UNK and then helped guide along a course favorable to soviet interests STOP 
START there was the revolution in UNK which we UNK did not exist STOP 
START only in one instance have we moved UNK and effectively to UNK existing communist power in UNK STOP 
START and contrary to what has been said recently we did not wait for outside pressures and world opinion to bring down that communist government moved UNK to effect an UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START we served our national interests and by so doing we saved the UNK people the ultimate in human misery STOP

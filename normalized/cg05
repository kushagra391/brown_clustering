START it was a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth century was a great period in UNK art STOP 
START the UNK the tile and carpet makers the UNK painters UNK and UNK worked through UNK UNK and those of his UNK to UNK the city STOP 
START UNK entering from the desert were UNK by what must have seemed an illusion a great garden filled with UNK and UNK cut by UNK and UNK UNK UNK with water tanks of UNK tile in which were reflected the UNK blue curves of a hundred UNK STOP 
START at the heart of all of this was the square which one such UNK declared to be as UNK as pleasant and UNK a market as any in the universe STOP 
START in time UNK came to be known as half the world UNK UNK STOP 
START in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the size of london started to decline STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK fell from power capital went elsewhere desert UNK STOP 
START UNK became more of a legend than a place and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old UNK and sometimes of the east STOP 
START they think of it as a kind of UNK museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old UNK STOP 
START those who actually get there find that it isn't UNK at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight STOP 
START but even for them it remains a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb a tomb in which UNK lies well preserved but indeed dead STOP 
START everyone is ready to grant the persians their history but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present STOP 
START it seems that for UNK and especially for this city there are only two times the glorious past and the UNK UNK UNK present STOP 
START the one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called historical UNK STOP 
START however just as all the buildings have not fallen and UNK back to their original mud so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared STOP 
START the values and talents which made the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the UNK continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty UNK STOP 
START often too the social institutions are housed in these UNK and UNK and bridges for these great structures are not simply historical UNK are the places where persians live STOP 
START the UNK for example continues to take place on the UNK UNK a UNK garden of plane and UNK trees that now serves as the city's principal street STOP 
START it takes place as well along the UNK and through the UNK of the UNK bridge and also in the gardens of the square STOP 
START on UNK the day when many persians relax with poetry talk and a UNK people do not it is true stream into UNK UNK a UNK and garden built by UNK UNK 2 in the seventeenth century but they do UNK into hundreds of UNK throughout the city and up the river valley which are smaller more humble copies of the former STOP 
START and of course religious life continues to center in the more famous UNK and commercial life very much a social institution in the UNK STOP 
START those three other great activities of the persians the bath the UNK and the UNK UNK the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an UNK pit move through a UNK of UNK dance UNK poetry and music do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold but some of them occupy splendid examples of UNK domestic architecture long UNK UNK rooms with UNK of UNK tile their end walls cut through to the UNK and the sky by open UNK STOP 
START but more important and the thing which the casual UNK and the blind UNK often do not see is that these places and activities are often the UNK in which persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic UNK STOP 
START water air fruit poetry music the human form these things are important to persians and they experience them with an intense and UNK awareness STOP 
START i should like by the way to make it clear that i am not using the word persians UNK STOP 
START i don't mean a few UNK who play about with UNK like a young prince in a UNK UNK his hand in a pool STOP 
START these things are important to almost all persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary STOP 
START the men crying love poems in an UNK on any UNK night are as often as not the UNK UNK UNK who spend most of their lives in and out of the local UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START a few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night UNK me up a UNK to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor STOP 
START not long ago an UNK a UNK water UNK of a UNK up from the UNK of the city stood on the UNK UNK his first cigarette in weeks STOP 
START the air he said was just right cigarette would taste particularly good STOP 
START i really didn't know what he meant STOP 
START it was a nice day granted STOP 
START but he knew UNK the air and UNK it on his lip and knew as a UNK knows a UNK STOP 
START the natural world then plus poetry and some kinds of art receives from the most ordinary of persians a great deal of attention STOP 
START the line of an UNK the color of the skin a UNK from UNK the purity of spring water the long afternoon among the UNK which crowd the upper story of a UNK these things are noticed judged and valued STOP 
START nowhere in UNK is this rich aesthetic life of the persians shown so well as during the UNK at the UNK bridge STOP 
START there has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the UNK corner of the city STOP 
START for one thing there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed another it was here that one of the old UNK UNK came in STOP 
START it was to provide a safe and UNK crossing for these UNK and also to make a UNK for the city that UNK UNK 2 in about UNK built of UNK brick tile and stone the present bridge STOP 
START it is a splendid structure STOP 
START from UNK it looks like a long UNK box laid across the river UNK where the water level is much lower it is a high UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the top story contains more than thirty UNK separated from each other by UNK of blue and yellow tile STOP 
START at either end and in the center there are UNK which contain nine greater UNK as UNK and UNK as church UNK STOP 
START here in the old days when they had come to see the moon or displays of UNK sat the king and his court while priests soldiers and other members of the party UNK in the smaller UNK between STOP 
START below twenty UNK UNK through the UNK of the bridge STOP 
START these are UNK by another line of UNK and thus rooms arched on all four sides are formed STOP 
START down through the axis of the bridge there is a long UNK UNK like a visual UNK of UNK and UNK while the UNK UNK UNK and down frame the sunset and UNK the mountains and river pools STOP 
START here on the UNK day it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the UNK at the bottom of the UNK STOP 
START on the UNK or UNK side these UNK give out onto UNK twice as wide as the bridge itself STOP 
START from the UNK eighteen in all broad flights of steps UNK into the water or onto still more UNK barely above the level of the river STOP 
START out of water brick and tile they have made far more than just a bridge STOP 
START on spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the UNK of the city to the bridge STOP 
START it is a great spectacle STOP 
START the bridge itself rises up from the river UNK and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera STOP 
START crowds press along the UNK down the steps in and out of the UNK UNK against it as though it were a UNK under UNK STOP 
START all kinds come to walk in the UNK merchants from the UNK UNK over a deal UNK UNK in a cap and UNK jacket who stand with the UNK of the blind their eyes UNK with UNK and UNK old UNK UNK arriving in their ancient UNK civil servants UNK musicians UNK and UNK STOP 
START families go out to the edge of the UNK to sit on UNK around a UNK STOP 
START below people line the steps as though on UNK to watch the sky and river STOP 
START above in the UNK UNK of the UNK boys sing the UNK of UNK and UNK while at the very bottom in the UNK the UNK and blades of the city UNK and UNK their drums drink UNK play dice and dance STOP 
START here in an evening persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them poetry water the moon a beautiful face STOP 
START to a stranger their delight in these things may seem UNK for persians chase the golden calf as much as any people STOP 
START many of them moreover are beginning to complain about the UNK of western UNK and to UNK the old life of the UNK merchant the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START UNK they take time out much time from the game of grab and these new western experiments to go to the gardens and UNK STOP 
START above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere to hear or quote some poetry STOP 
START poetry in UNK life is far more than a common ground on which in a society deeply UNK by UNK all may stand STOP 
START it contains in fact their whole outlook on life STOP 
START and it is expressed at least to their taste in a perfect form STOP 
START poetry for a UNK is nothing less than truth and beauty STOP 
START in most western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and UNK STOP 
START in UNK where practically speaking there are no UNK or libraries or for that matter hardly any books the twins run free STOP 
START it is perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine that tonight on london bridge the UNK boys of the east end will gather to sing UNK UNK shakespeare and perhaps some lyrics of their own STOP 
START that at any rate is what happens at the UNK bridge STOP 
START boys and men go along the UNK or to the UNK in the top UNK STOP 
START here in these little rooms or stages arched open to the sky and river they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the UNK into which UNK music is divided STOP 
START each mode is believed to have a specific UNK one UNK pleasure another UNK another love and so on to include all of the emotions STOP 
START the UNK simply matches the poem to a mode example the mode of UNK to this anonymous folk poem they brought me news that spring is in the plains and UNK blood the UNK UNK UNK tell his aged mother that her son fought with a thousand UNK and he was one STOP 
START or the mode of love to this UNK by a recent poet know ye fair folk who UNK on earth or shall UNK come to birth that here with dust upon his eyes UNK the UNK UNK lies STOP 
START in this true UNK tomb UNK a world of love lies UNK STOP 
START these songs practically all UNK music for that matter are limited to a range of two UNK STOP 
START yet within this UNK there is an UNK variety design as UNK as that in the carpet or UNK with the UNK line like the painted or UNK line often flowing into an UNK STOP

START standing in the shelter of the tent a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now UNK no longer UNK adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the UNK counter of boards laid across two beer UNK STOP 
START there was of course no real need to UNK everything STOP 
START a quarter inch this way or that for the UNK or the UNK or the UNK sugar or the UNK or the UNK or the UNK milk or the UNK or the UNK what could it mean watched his own hands make the UNK anxious movement that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the UNK has been the ritual of stall UNK forever STOP 
START he recognized the gesture STOP 
START he knew its meaning STOP 
START he had seen a dry old UNK hand reach out with that painful UNK to touch to UNK to shift UNK some object worth a UNK STOP 
START back in UNK he had seen that gesture and at that sight his heart had always died within him STOP 
START on such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever face it might be STOP 
START now the face was his own STOP 
START he wondered what expression as he made that gesture was on his face STOP 
START he wondered if it wore the old anxiety or the old UNK UNK STOP 
START but there was no need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show concern or UNK STOP 
START it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came STOP 
START then why was he assuming the role the gesture and the suffering was he UNK was he now taking the role the gesture and the suffering because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the UNK UNK UNK of this land STOP 
START this was virginia STOP 
START he looked out of the tent at the company street STOP 
START the rain UNK on the freezing UNK of the street STOP 
START beyond that UNK gray of the rain he saw the stretching UNK low UNK log UNK UNK with mud with UNK a man would have to UNK to get through with UNK of UNK laid over UNK or boards from UNK boxes or fence UNK with UNK UNK of sticks and dried mud STOP 
START the UNK of the hut across from him was UNK by a beef barrel with ends knocked out STOP 
START in this heavy air however that device did not seem to help STOP 
START the smoke from that UNK rose as UNK as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the UNK UNK back down along the UNK canvas of the roof STOP 
START over the door was a board with large UNK UNK home sweet home STOP 
START this was the hut of simms purdew the hero STOP 
START the men were UNK in those UNK STOP 
START adam knew the names of some STOP 
START he knew the faces of all UNK or UNK old or young fat or thin suffering or hardened sad or gay good or bad STOP 
START when they stood about his tent UNK each other UNK their UNK UNK command or weather he had studied their faces STOP 
START he had had the need to understand what life UNK behind the UNK of flesh behind the UNK the UNK the UNK STOP 
START once UNK looking at simms purdew the only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy UNK UNK jaw open and close to UNK the cruel UNK UNK and had seen the UNK eyes go UNK with whisky and UNK and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that UNK creature STOP 
START he was seeing somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once have been a boy with UNK hair and blue eyes dancing with UNK and the boy mouth UNK UNK among the UNK STOP 
START in that moment of vision adam heard the voice within himself saying i must not hate him i must not hate him or i shall die STOP 
START his heart suddenly opened to joy STOP 
START he thought that if once only once he could talk with simms purdew something about his own life and all life would be clear and simple STOP 
START if simms purdew would turn to him and say adam you know when i was a boy it was a funny thing happened STOP 
START UNK tell you now if only simms purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told STOP 
START it would be a sign for the UNK and he adam would understand STOP 
START now adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the hut opposite his tent and thought of simms purdew lying in there in the gloom UNK on his bunk with the UNK of whisky UNK the air STOP 
START he saw the sign above the door of the hut home sweet home STOP 
START he saw the figure of a man in a UNK coming up the company street with an UNK of wood STOP 
START it was UNK james the UNK of simms purdew STOP 
START he carried the wood carried the water did the cooking cleaning and UNK and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his pains STOP 
START adam watched the UNK flow from the UNK STOP 
START it gave the UNK fabric a dull UNK like metal STOP 
START UNK james UNK lowered his head pushed aside the UNK door of the hut and was gone from sight STOP 
START adam stared at the door and remembered that simms purdew had been awarded the UNK of honor for UNK at UNK STOP 
START the street was again empty STOP 
START the UNK was UNK off now but the light was UNK STOP 
START with enormous interest adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him STOP 
START into the UNK of the street and his spirit moved a form STOP 
START the form was UNK in an army blanket much UNK fastened at the neck with a UNK STOP 
START from under the UNK UNK of blanket the feet moved in the mud STOP 
START the feet wore army shoes in obvious UNK STOP 
START the head was wrapped in a UNK and on top of the UNK rode a great UNK across which a piece of UNK had been flung STOP 
START the gray face stared straight ahead in the UNK STOP 
START UNK ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at the chin STOP 
START the figure was close enough now for him to see the nose UNK to UNK the drop UNK there STOP 
START the figure stopped and one hand was UNK freed from the UNK to UNK the nose STOP 
START then the figure moved on STOP 
START this was one of the irish women who had built their own UNK down near the river STOP 
START they did washing STOP 
START adam recognized this one STOP 
START he recognized her because she was the one who in a winter UNK on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly STOP 
START slice o' UNK UNK had UNK in her soft UNK STOP 
START slice o' UNK name was UNK STOP 
START they called her UNK the UNK and laughed STOP 
START looking down the street after her adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket STOP 
START he could not make out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose STOP 
START UNK the UNK was scratching her nose STOP 
START the words ran UNK in his head UNK the UNK is scratching her nose in the rain STOP 
START then the words fell into a pattern UNK the UNK is scratching her nose scratching her nose in the rain STOP 
START UNK the UNK is scratching her nose in the rain STOP 
START the pattern would not stop STOP 
START it came again and again STOP 
START he felt UNK in that pattern in the repetition STOP 
START suddenly he thought he might weep STOP 
START what's the matter with me demanded out loud STOP 
START he looked wildly around at the now empty street at the mud at the rain STOP 
START oh what's the matter with me demanded STOP 
START when he had stored his stock in the great oak chest locked the two big UNK and secured the additional chain tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up the UNK street STOP 
START he would UNK the cash box into the hands of UNK UNK then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold STOP 
START then he then what did not know STOP 
START his mind closed on that prospect as though fog had UNK to UNK out a valley STOP 
START far off in the UNK he heard voices singing muffled but strong STOP 
START in one of the UNK a group of men were UNK together singing STOP 
START he stopped STOP 
START he strained to hear STOP 
START he heard the words rock of ages UNK for me let me hide myself in thee the water and the blood from thy UNK side flow he thought i am a jew from UNK STOP 
START he was standing there he thought in virginia in the UNK UNK in a costly UNK that had belonged to another jew STOP 
START that other jew a young man too had left that UNK behind in a rich house and UNK away STOP 
START he had crossed the river which now beyond the woods UNK was sliding UNK under the mist STOP 
START he had plunged into the dark woods beyond STOP 
START he had died there STOP 
START what had that man that other young jew felt as he stood in the UNK and heard other men far away singing together thought of the UNK regiment after regiment row after row the thousands of UNK stretching away into the night STOP 
START he thought of the men the UNK thousands UNK in them STOP 
START he thought of simms purdew UNK on his bunk while UNK james crouched by the UNK UNK an UNK for UNK and a wet log UNK STOP 
START he thought of simms purdew who once had UNK at the edge of a UNK a UNK scream on his lips and swung a UNK UNK like a UNK to beat down the UNK of rebel UNK about him STOP 
START he thought of simms purdew rising up UNK in glory STOP 
START he felt the UNK of pity flood through him UNK his very flesh STOP 
START those men lying in the UNK they did not know STOP 
START they did not know who they were or know their own worth STOP 
START in the pity for them his UNK was gone STOP 
START then he thought of UNK UNK standing in his rich house saying god is tired of taking the blame STOP 
START he is going to let history take the blame for a while STOP 
START he thought of the old man laughing under the UNK of the great UNK STOP 
START he thought only in my heart can i make the world hang together STOP 
START adam rose from the UNK necessary to enter the hut STOP 
START he saw UNK UNK by the UNK breaking up UNK into a pan STOP 
START a pot was UNK on the UNK STOP 
START gonna give UNK UNK all his money asked softly STOP 
START adam nodded STOP 
START yeah UNK murmured yeah STOP

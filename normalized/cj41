START UNK policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases STOP 
START the purpose of this paper is to UNK one possible force which has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the UNK behavior of a few very important industries STOP 
START while there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable the authors make particular claim of UNK to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the united states since world war 2 STOP 
START indeed the apparent UNK of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented STOP 
START the model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but which is so basic that its UNK policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny STOP 
START where the industry's product price has been kept below the UNK and UNK prices due to fears of public reaction the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands STOP 
START the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition and an exploration of some of its implications STOP 
START in order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call the effect of UNK UNK on key wage UNK we deliberately UNK the model by UNK from other forces such as union power which may be relevant in an actual situation STOP 
START for UNK purposes this is best treated as a model which UNK out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages STOP 
START part 1 below describes this abstract model by UNK out its assumptions STOP 
START part 2 UNK the operation of the model and UNK some significant conclusions STOP 
START part 3 UNK the empirical UNK and policy implications of the conclusions STOP 
START part 4 is a brief summary STOP 
START the mathematical UNK presents the UNK argument but is best read after part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the UNK may be explicit STOP 
START 1 the assumptions of the model a STOP 
START -hlthe industry the industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product STOP 
START price competition is lacking STOP 
START for the purposes of setting the product price the industry UNK as a single UNK STOP 
START in wage negotiations the industry UNK as a unit with a single union STOP 
START b STOP 
START -hlthe demand for the industry's product we are concerned with UNK demand for the industry's product STOP 
START the manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given STOP 
START in any given time period the UNK demand for the industry's product is determined by two things the price charged by the industry and the level of aj STOP 
START for the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is UNK in these two variables since UNK includes other prices STOP 
START we abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change UNK STOP 
START the form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary UNK with the product price and vary directly with the level of aj STOP 
START c STOP 
START UNK product price policy the industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest STOP 
START because of its importance and because the lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases STOP 
START the threat of effective anti-trust action UNK by UNK the public through price increases not justified by cost increases and fears of UNK relations with customers congress the general public and the press all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases STOP 
START for the industry of this model the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the UNK UNK price given the wage rate and the level of UNK and even below the UNK price but not below average cost STOP 
START for such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an increase is UNK justified by rising costs due to rising wages etc. STOP 
START thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate STOP 
START in this model we abstract from all UNK sources of cost changes so that the UNK price only rises as the wage rate rises STOP 
START in such circumstances it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate STOP 
START since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the UNK price also rises when the UNK price is elevated and is likely to remain well above the latter STOP 
START the UNK price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but unless general UNK permits profit UNK to increase UNK throughout the economy we might expect the UNK price to approach the UNK price STOP 
START the UNK price would be approached more rapidly since domestic UNK do not enter foreign costs directly STOP 
START where this approach becomes critical the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in UNK the wage pressures of a powerful union UNK UNK relief after it has UNK UNK to the union pressure STOP 
START whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the UNK price rises in response to a basic wage increase and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase STOP 
START the extent to which the UNK price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things the passage of time the level of UNK and the size of the wage increase STOP 
START we are UNK from the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to which the UNK price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry STOP 
START the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure on the union but in order to UNK the government and the customers of the industry STOP 
START as a strike continues these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement STOP 
START they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage UNK would UNK STOP 
START public UNK and resistance to UNK increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of UNK per UNK than when the increases are on the order of UNK per month STOP 
START the simple passage of an additional eleven UNK time makes the second UNK boost more acceptable STOP 
START thus the UNK price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase STOP 
START notice however that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per UNK without an accompanying wage increase STOP 
START similarly higher levels of UNK do not in themselves provide grounds for raising prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase STOP 
START this is not extended to anticipated levels of UNK however only the current level of UNK affects the public pressure against UNK increases STOP 
START finally since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies larger wage increases call for less than UNK larger price increases e.g. if a wage increase of UNK allows a price increase of UNK a wage increase of UNK allows a price increase of something less than UNK STOP 
START d STOP 
START UNK costs we assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced the average cost curve is UNK and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve and is the same for every firm and therefore for the industry STOP 
START the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology and so forth STOP 
START as we have noted however we are UNK from changes in all UNK of this level except for changes in the wage rate STOP 
START the level of average cost equal to marginal cost is thus strictly a function of the wage rate STOP 
START e STOP 
START UNK policies and collective bargaining issues the single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate STOP 
START the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment STOP 
START the union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases and wage increases to UNK UNK increases but we abstract from these forces here STOP 
START for our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate not including productivity improvement factors or UNK adjustments and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs STOP 
START productivity is something of an UNK concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public STOP 
START disagreement on the amount of productivity increase UNK the problem of UNK how an increase in profit UNK related to a productivity increase should be shared STOP 
START the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not UNK the assumption that the union is willing to settle for UNK and UNK increases as distinct from a UNK increase in the basic wage rate STOP 
START we assume further that the union UNK the possibility that UNK increases may UNK UNK increases and it does not entirely UNK the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the real wage rate STOP 
START for internal political reasons the union asks for and UNK increases in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate UNK is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry STOP 
START changes in the basic wage rate are UNK and they constitute an argument for raising prices STOP 
START however it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude STOP 
START in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may in circumstances to be UNK out in part 2 below find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise STOP 
START thus for UNK changes in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active UNK since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry UNK STOP 
START the UNK in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be UNK in this case on the grounds that it is clearly not in the interest of the industry to raise wages UNK STOP 
START from this UNK it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model STOP 
START it is this conclusion that we challenge do so by UNK the UNK on which it is based STOP 
START 2 the operation of the model it is convenient to assume that the UNK contract is of one year's duration STOP

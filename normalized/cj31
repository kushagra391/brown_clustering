START it is not easy for the therapist to UNK when in the patient's UNK an UNK has appeared and is holding UNK STOP 
START one UNK to become alert to changes in his vocal tone to his UNK suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one a quality which sounds somehow artificial or in some instances UNK STOP 
START the content of his words may UNK back into UNK repetition as if a UNK needle were stuck in one UNK seldom is it so simple as to be a matter of his obviously UNK some UNK UNK common to our culture which he has evidently heard over and over from a parent until he experiences it as part of him STOP 
START one UNK woman often became UNK in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of UNK during which despite her UNK UNK and UNK cheeks i felt only a cold UNK with her STOP 
START eventually such incidents became more UNK and more sharply UNK from her UNK behavior and in one particular session after several minutes of such behavior which as usual went on without any accompanying words from her she asked eagerly did you see UNK first i did not know what she meant thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her UNK in their distant UNK STOP 
START then i realized that she had been deliberately showing me this time what UNK was like when i replied in this spirit she UNK my UNK STOP 
START at another phase in the therapy when a UNK UNK began to emerge more and more upon the UNK scene she muttered in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside me could UNK no further UNK from her about this a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room from me looking me in the eyes and saying in a UNK UNK tone your father UNK you i at first UNK this UNK intense communication and i quickly cast through my mind to account for her being able to speak with such utter conviction of an opinion held by my father now several years UNK STOP 
START then i replied UNK if you UNK me why don't you say so directly looked confused at this and i felt sure it had been a wrong response for me to make STOP 
START it then occurred to me to ask is that what that woman told you clearly agreed that this had been the case STOP 
START i realized now that she had been showing me in what impressed me as being a very accurate way something her mother had once said to her was as if she was showing me one of the reasons why she hated that woman inside her STOP 
START what had been an UNK powerful UNK was now despite its continuing charge of energy UNK to me sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this UNK mother was like STOP 
START earlier this woman had been so filled with a UNK variety of UNK that at times when she was in her room alone it would sound to a UNK as though there were several different persons in the room as she would UNK in various kinds of voice STOP 
START a somewhat less UNK UNK patient of mine who used to often UNK herself in her room often sounded through the closed door as i would find on passing by between our sessions for all the world like two persons a UNK mother and a defensive child STOP 
START particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is UNK an UNK UNK to something in the therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware and the recognition of which as a part of himself he finds distinctly UNK STOP 
START i have found time and again that some bit of particularly UNK and UNK behavior on the part of a patient rests in the final analysis on this basis only when i can acknowledge this to myself as being indeed an aspect of my personality does it cease to be a UNK UNK aspect of the patient's behavior STOP 
START for example one UNK man used to UNK me month after month by saying whenever i got up to leave and made my fairly UNK comment that i would be seeing him on the following day or whenever you're welcome in a notably UNK fashion as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a UNK grateful thank you to him at the end of each session STOP 
START eventually it became clear to me partly with the aid of another UNK patient who could point out my UNK to me somewhat more directly that this man with his UNK you're welcome was very accurately UNK an element of UNK UNK which had been present in my own UNK over these months on each of these occasions when i had bid him UNK with the UNK note each time that the UNK christ would be UNK to UNK this UNK to the poor UNK again on the UNK STOP 
START another patient a UNK woman for many months UNK not only me but the UNK and her fellow patients by UNK UNK as though she owned the whole building as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met STOP 
START this behavior on her part UNK only after i had come to see the UNK close UNK between on the one hand her arranging the UNK of the common living room to her own liking or turning the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others and on the other hand my own coming UNK into her room despite her persistent and UNK objections bringing my big easy chair with me usually UNK the windows of her room which she preferred to keep in a very cold state and UNK myself down in my chair in short UNK as if i owned her room STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated or reduced in their UNK expression to some comparatively UNK verbal or UNK statement STOP 
START one finds for example that a UNK and UNK verbal expression seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention reveals itself over the months of therapy as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings and the most UNK of meanings STOP 
START more than anything it is the UNK UNK UNK of these UNK meanings in the stereotype which helps these meanings to become revealed something like a UNK deck of cards on UNK occasions over the passage of the patient's and his months of work together STOP 
START one cannot assume of course that all these UNK meanings were inherent in the stereotype at the beginning of the therapy or at any one time later on when the stereotype was UNK it is correct to think of it as a matter of a UNK UNK mode of expression and no or but a few other UNK UNK as yet being there available for the patient's use as UNK emotions and ideas well up in him over the course of months STOP 
START but it is true that the therapist can sense when he UNK this stereotype that there are at this moment many emotional UNK at work in it a UNK UNK of UNK voices which have yet to become clearly UNK from one another STOP 
START sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype a how are you now an i want to go home or whatever but a UNK one which reveals itself gradually as the UNK expression of more than one UNK meaning STOP 
START a UNK man used to give a UNK wave of his hand a number of times during his UNK hours with his therapist STOP 
START when the therapist came to feel on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him what is that bill UNK or farewell the patient replied both UNK two in one STOP 
START of all the possible forms of UNK expression that which seems best to give release and UNK expression to complex and UNK feelings is laughter STOP 
START it is no coincidence that the UNK patient the most severely UNK of all UNK patients shows as one of his characteristic symptoms laughter laughter which now makes one feel UNK or hated which now makes one feel like UNK or which now gives one a glimpse of the UNK and empty UNK of man's despair which more often than all these UNK a UNK of feelings which could in no way be UNK by any number of words words which are so unlike this UNK in being formed and UNK from one another STOP 
START to a much less full extent the UNK UNK UNK or UNK has a comparable UNK function working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private UNK over of the possible meaning of a UNK or the passage of UNK not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to UNK but also because he UNK that even these UNK sounds constitute forms of communication in which from time to time quite different things are being said long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these as distinct feelings and concepts to say them in words STOP 
START as i have been UNK in the UNK and perhaps also in the dreams of the UNK is a question which i have no wish to take up UNK is a phenomenon in which one finds not a UNK expression of various feelings and ideas which are at an unconscious level well UNK out but rather a UNK expression of feelings and ideas which even in the unconscious have yet to become well UNK from one another STOP 
START freeman UNK and UNK in their description of the UNK of thinking found in chronic UNK patients say in regard to UNK that the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment and the objects contained UNK in itself is the UNK UNK STOP 
START in my experience a great many of the patient's more UNK verbal communications are so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become UNK from UNK meanings in his subjective experience STOP 
START thus he may be referring to some concrete thing or incident in his immediate environment by some UNK UNK reference to UNK events on the UNK scene STOP 
START recently for example a UNK woman's UNK UNK in the session about the UNK curiosity which has become in her opinion a UNK characteristic of UNK human culture developed itself before the end of the session into a suspicion that i was UNK UNK at her partially exposed breast as indeed i was STOP 
START or equally often a UNK UNK statement may consist with its UNK UNK in a form of poetry may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a UNK expression a UNK a smile an UNK or some other symbolic mode of speaking STOP 
START of such hidden meanings the patient himself is more often than not entirely unaware STOP 
START his subjective experience may be a remarkably UNK one STOP 
START one UNK women UNK to me i live in a world of words as if to her words were fully concrete objects in his excellent article 1955 concerning UNK communication includes mention of similar clinical material STOP 
START a UNK UNK young man told me that to him the various theoretical concepts about which he had been UNK in a most UNK fashion during session after session with me were like great UNK of almost UNK solid matter up in the air above him he spoke i was reminded of the great UNK of UNK which are swung high in the air from a UNK UNK STOP

START such a little thing to start with the car registration STOP 
START UNK where is the car license asked STOP 
START i can't find it in the UNK compartment STOP 
START via must have it i answered readily enough UNK her last visit STOP 
START via she was frowning STOP 
START why should via have it she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children was silent STOP 
START i didn't want to UNK things up STOP 
START i drive my own car by UNK of via i'm sure she'd turn it over to you if you'd rather STOP 
START you know that STOP 
START she looked as if she were UNK me of some UNK STOP 
START she must have taken the registration when she went to UNK STOP 
START i'll call her STOP 
START no thank you STOP 
START i want nothing of UNK STOP 
START why should this suddenly UNK her was giving me checks for my pay the household bills STOP 
START had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind what a fool i've been she said quietly STOP 
START i knew all this but i paid no attention STOP 
START i don't even own the house i'm standing in STOP 
START i was so sure it was all temporary that we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those things it UNK down down down and finally there is no way out STOP 
START if i am not to be mrs. UNK i am nothing STOP 
START i suppose i should have paid attention to that UNK remark but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress UNK in STOP 
START i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself and in the same sequence i love you i think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living STOP 
START so i went about my business STOP 
START i made a lemon UNK a light UNK UNK a chicken UNK some frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the UNK for the weekend STOP 
START don't bother UNK she said STOP 
START i have these UNK in town for saturday and i'll probably spend sunday with UNK or the UNK STOP 
START at last i thought she's UNK her spirits STOP 
START with this UNK in london and new faces about her there she would soon be a more UNK a UNK person all the better for her stay out here STOP 
START i felt more UNK as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater UNK of herself STOP 
START and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life STOP 
START it was UNK that evening but the path to my house was so well UNK that i could feel my way accustomed as i was to the UNK UNK that rise from the UNK UNK of the river and sometimes last for days STOP 
START in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my UNK full on STOP 
START i did notice a UNK of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs. UNK had done the same before she left for town STOP 
START i did my shopping had my dentist appointment and from there i went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual christmas UNK so that UNK was beginning to gather when i drove home in the late afternoon STOP 
START but the next day sunday STOP 
START why when i drove down to church didn't it speak to me seeing the lights still on and the day UNK and clear brought to the UNK accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove absent itself UNK STOP 
START when i came back from church at noon mrs. UNK was turning into the UNK driveway STOP 
START even at a UNK length i could sense that something was wrong and so i followed her up to the UNK in front of the house STOP 
START UNK UNK was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us STOP 
START she's nowhere nowhere screamed and both women ran up to the house and i followed STOP 
START the search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening UNK talking UNK in UNK and UNK STOP 
START everything was as i had left it the night before last her UNK and bag for town her UNK and dress and shoes laid out only her UNK coat was missing STOP 
START and she STOP 
START then the UNK began STOP 
START i who until that day before had been mrs. UNK friend her equal was the servant now STOP 
START it was UNK and mrs. UNK who were calling via everybody STOP 
START and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me STOP 
START and after i brought them UNK and coffee i had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait STOP 
START sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs. UNK said that could have been a sign to me STOP 
START if i am not to be mrs. UNK then i am nothing STOP 
START why didn't that alarm me then when she returned from taking her guests back to new york she had said all they talked about was UNK UNK this UNK that when they know the truth will they drop away from me will i become a nothing then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her UNK over and over again on the boat people liked me for myself STOP 
START i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage just to check STOP 
START the last night i had called but the line was always busy and it UNK me STOP 
START i assumed it was one of those UNK UNK with UNK or UNK she comfortable in bed STOP 
START but it seemed not from what they were saying STOP 
START then was it a final desperate plea from her to whom on and on past any man's patience some final UNK of conclusion was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff STOP 
START i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the night as she had a habit of doing STOP 
START sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff STOP 
START it's so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river UNK in its UNK like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic STOP 
START with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a UNK rock a UNK STOP 
START but i didn't really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else STOP 
START when a UNK brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a child asleep i began to UNK with a terrible excitement almost UNK that i still cannot account for STOP 
START was it a UNK release from the long strain of UNK of those weeks at last the UNK the will gives way what was it that before via UNK walter and all i began almost to dance with UNK and cry out i knew she'd do it knew stared at me and drew back STOP 
START their eyes turned cold and UNK even UNK STOP 
START and they have never changed STOP 
START at the same time that i thought i understood her at long last and UNK her underneath this knowing had there burned UNK by my pity a fire of hate an UNK UNK that burst out in that UNK UNK that what had given way in me now i am UNK at how little anyone knows of what they really are STOP 
START it is absurd of course to say that that one UNK UNK me from the family i considered my very own but there it UNK a cooling UNK that broke our close connection with each other STOP 
START at the time i was filled with UNK at this separation but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that UNK STOP 
START in my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her so if they told themselves that i could have prevented it i can understand that by now and love them still because everyone must justify have a UNK for what is not to be UNK STOP 
START it is not their UNK that UNK is when i meet someone who was a close friend of the family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so UNK and walk away that it UNK STOP 
START i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had cried out so UNK at the sight of her body STOP 
START no i forget mrs. UNK who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened STOP 
START she UNK me UNK in explaining how and why she had advised mrs. UNK to return to the country STOP 
START we all feel guilty i turned away from her UNK STOP 
START it was UNK fault STOP 
START she UNK her hand STOP 
START what do you mean UNK STOP 
START why put such a high value on being top dog added STOP 
START it was UNK almost UNK this harsh UNK and she has never come to see me since STOP 
START but suppose she had not taken mrs. UNK advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns UNK of love hanging on to UNK and altogether and finally UNK STOP 
START if she chose and in that final decision UNK what above all all of us value life itself must she not have UNK to her UNK height and UNK her UNK self felt at last the passion of a great moral decision they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of UNK her search into herself and its conclusions STOP 
START yes i had cried out that i knew she'd do it but without my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise at her UNK from UNK and UNK and guilt STOP 
START she was finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice STOP 
START at rest with my darling UNK the first mrs. UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK came home STOP 
START the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister how clean and UNK his UNK and his neat body standing beside that UNK with that UNK inside a stranger speaking to UNK the old sacred words and the rain UNK UNK in UNK seven days of UNK rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be UNK STOP 
START i waited STOP 
START then via called to say they had decided to UNK her as they had UNK the thought leaped to my mind and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning STOP 
START the UNK stood on UNK in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the UNK of white UNK i had ordered STOP 
START i UNK just for UNK i thought at the time but found myself UNK our father which art in heaven and it was only after that that something unlocked in me and i felt a UNK STOP 
START via was in the parking lot when i went outside STOP 
START together we waited in her car until the UNK moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey STOP 
START by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the UNK auditorium with its UNK symbols of religious UNK STOP 
START again i felt UNK to UNK and reached back and pulled via down STOP 
START something would come into her heart if nothing else the sounds of UNK would give her some UNK STOP

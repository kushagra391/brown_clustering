START thus the three main categories of UNK warfare operations are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense STOP 
START the last category UNK the others in UNK operations and near UNK and bases STOP 
START to effect these operations five elements exist 1 surface 2 air 3 mines 4 submarine and 5 fixed installations STOP 
START surface forces have been used to provide defense UNK around naval and merchant ship UNK air to furnish area UNK and mines for protection of limited areas STOP 
START submarines and shore installations are new elements STOP 
START the submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in UNK enemy access to ocean areas STOP 
START fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection STOP 
START mine warfare is being UNK against submarine targets STOP 
START a sixth element not always considered is intelligence STOP 
START it includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment STOP 
START operational intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies on the environment will come from the recently UNK program in UNK STOP 
START the major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered UNK but in combination and as being mutually supporting STOP 
START necessity for an over-all concept thinking on submarine defense has not always been UNK STOP 
START UNK of single elements tend to UNK UNK of that element without determining if it is justified and the element with the most enthusiastic and UNK UNK has assumed the greatest importance STOP 
START consequently air surface and submarine elements UNK the mine fixed installations and intelligence STOP 
START these have sought more and more of what they have STOP 
START each seems to UNK for UNK of the necessity for the others STOP 
START this despite postwar experience UNK that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting STOP 
START thus the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed STOP 
START this is stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would provide positions of relative importance to UNK elements based on projected UNK STOP 
START then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be UNK to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective STOP 
START an over-all concept would have other advantages STOP 
START it would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach STOP 
START now the problem is presented UNK and sometimes UNK STOP 
START while one element is UNK progress another is UNK its problems STOP 
START the result can only be confusion in the public mind STOP 
START a unified concept can serve as a guide to UNK and if public support is gained will command congressional support STOP 
START industry's main criticism of the navy's UNK effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and UNK STOP 
START lacking guidance industry UNK its own areas STOP 
START the result coupled with the UNK for which american industry is famous is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas STOP 
START an over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest UNK STOP 
START therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for UNK of the navy's efforts for a logical presentation to the public for industry's guidance and as a basis for a program to the congress STOP 
START principles involved in an over-all concept that which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of UNK warfare STOP 
START russia UNK the UNK of submarines in the world divided between her various UNK STOP 
START some are also in UNK and others are on loan to egypt STOP 
START other countries which may UNK or UNK become communist can furnish bases STOP 
START communist target areas can be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with soviet intentions STOP 
START attack can come from almost any direction against many locations STOP 
START logically then the first principle of the plan must be that it is not UNK oriented toward any geographical area STOP 
START it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building at bases in transit and on station STOP 
START destruction of the UNK building and base complex however requires attacks on enemy territory which is possible only in event of UNK UNK STOP 
START in transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act STOP 
START the communists are UNK at UNK UNK short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage STOP 
START therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while providing for UNK UNK its effectiveness is not dependent on general war STOP 
START UNK warfare does not involve UNK between large opposing forces with the decision a result of a single battle STOP 
START it is a war of UNK of single actions of an exchange of losses STOP 
START this exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units STOP 
START initially having fewer units of some elements especially submarines than the opponent our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will be in our favor STOP 
START therefore the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types unless at an assured favorable exchange rate STOP 
START the submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since world war 2 STOP 
START its speed has increased it operates at increasingly greater depths its UNK endurance is becoming unlimited and it will become even more silent STOP 
START the next developments will probably be in UNK STOP 
START the missile can gradually be expected to replace the UNK STOP 
START as detection UNK increase weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these UNK STOP 
START therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent STOP 
START no element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense STOP 
START some elements support the others but all have limitations STOP 
START some limitations of one element can be UNK for by a capability of another STOP 
START elements used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements STOP 
START therefore the UNK fifth principle must be that it UNK on the capabilities of all elements in combination STOP 
START UNK the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces STOP 
START numbers would be UNK and current fiscal policies make this an UNK solution STOP 
START UNK aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything STOP 
START therefore any measures taken in UNK which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when UNK occur STOP 
START therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements STOP 
START the world is constantly changing was new yesterday is UNK today STOP 
START the seventh principle of the plan is UNK must be flexible enough to allow for technological UNK scientific progress and changes in world conditions STOP 
START supporting elements in UNK operations to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles UNK its content laid down and the supporting elements listed STOP 
START before considering these elements in more detail an additional requirement should be stated STOP 
START large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks STOP 
START therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage STOP 
START but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented UNK STOP 
START consequently the system giving area coverage if such coverage is less than world wide must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile STOP 
START since effective area coverage appears fairly remote the requirement can be UNK in mind while considering the elements air surface UNK fixed installations mines and intelligence STOP 
START these are arranged approximately in the order of the UNK of their UNK but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result STOP 
START intelligence as used UNK will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations STOP 
START these can be referred to as operational intelligence and UNK intelligence STOP 
START in submarine defense these must have maximum stress STOP 
START good operational intelligence can UNK sound planning greatly reduce force requirements and increase UNK effectiveness STOP 
START UNK intelligence is just as important STOP 
START the ocean presently UNK with the target STOP 
START full knowledge of the science of UNK can bring the environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development of methods of UNK on the environment STOP 
START therefore improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as it supports all other elements rates a top priority STOP 
START gathering intelligence is important but of equal importance is its translation into UNK form STOP 
START a program is needed to translate the results of UNK research into UNK and operating instructions STOP 
START approaching this problem on a statistical basis is UNK because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions but under the conditions most UNK to him STOP 
START therefore the UNK commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time of encounter STOP 
START all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then STOP 
START temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and animal life are the chief UNK variables STOP 
START there may be others STOP 
START variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature because more of the variables would be UNK STOP 
START these variations must eventually be measured UNK as well as UNK STOP 
START progress in UNK water conditions is encouraging but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information STOP 
START a UNK effort is needed to make UNK data useful on the spot STOP 
START mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets STOP 
START by its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater UNK STOP 
START mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets STOP 
START they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters however and targets must come within a few yards of them STOP 
START mines need to be recognized as a major element in UNK warfare employment extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit increased STOP 
START mines can be used to deny access to great areas are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and can be put into place quickly STOP 
START a most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package STOP 
START effective employment will reduce force requirements STOP 
START for example effective mine barriers from florida to cuba and across the UNK channel from cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense UNK patrol UNK UNK shipping control and mine defense for the entire gulf of mexico STOP 
START more extended systems covering all passage into the UNK would free the UNK and the gulf of mexico from the previously listed requirements STOP 
START systems covering the gulf of st. lawrence and possibly the entire UNK of the united states are not impossible STOP 
START such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open UNK with UNK increase in the probability of success STOP 
START the advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is UNK any of the other elements STOP 
START fixed installations are increasingly UNK as the problem of area defense UNK STOP 
START the UNK are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts STOP 
START systems which UNK submarines over wide areas are attractive although they can be only UNK UNK STOP 
START mobile forces are required to UNK and attack detected targets since the systems are not capable of UNK a target STOP 
START such systems are expensive and are oriented UNK STOP 
START in an over-all UNK concept dependence on and effort expended for such systems should be limited to those with proven capabilities STOP 
START no general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined STOP 
START in addition proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a UNK mobile system STOP 
START fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems STOP 
START the submarine has become increasingly attractive as an UNK weapon system STOP 
START it operates in its UNK environment and any advantage gained UNK by the target is shared by the UNK STOP 
START but the submarine is a weapon of UNK and therefore always in danger of being UNK STOP

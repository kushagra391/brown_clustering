START it was not as though she noted clearly that her UNK had not been to see her for ten years not since their last journey UNK to witness their uncle UNK being lowered into the UNK soil aside from due UNK of certain major events in their lives two marriages two UNK one divorce christmas and easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the UNK years STOP 
START her thoughts were not UNK STOP 
START but there was a look about her mouth as though she were UNK UNK STOP 
START she grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird alert for flight STOP 
START she turned and walked UNK into the parlor to the UNK UNK UNK and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray STOP 
START there she UNK two limp UNK sheets and wrote off the letters one to abel one to mark STOP 
START once her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against the paper the words came sharply smoothly as UNK as they would dropping from her own lips STOP 
START and the UNK UNK look of them she saw grimly lacked the UNK of age which UNK the efforts of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin UNK string STOP 
START please come down as soon as you UNK can the upright letters UNK from the UNK pen i have an important matter to discuss with you STOP 
START to abel i am afraid there is not much to UNK small children here STOP 
START i should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters STOP 
START you may stay as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account i think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in STOP 
START to mark please give my UNK to myra STOP 
START she signed the letters quickly UNK them and placed them on the hall table for UNK to mail in town STOP 
START then she went back to the UNK chair and UNK adjusted her eyes to the UNK on the water STOP 
START my UNK will be coming down she said that evening as UNK brought her dinner into the dining room the whole meal on a vast UNK tray STOP 
START she looked at the girl UNK from eyes which had UNK with the years the early evening lights of them which had first startled UNK to look at her in an UNK way they had faded to a UNK of color which had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of the light of the sea in them STOP 
START UNK placed the tray on the table and with a UNK of dark UNK drew off the cloth STOP 
START she smiled and the teeth UNK in her beautifully UNK UNK face STOP 
START that will be so nice for you mrs. packard she said STOP 
START her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in UNK UNK before the warm UNK lips met and her mouth settled in UNK STOP 
START UNK said the old lady and brought her eyes down to the tray STOP 
START you remember them i suppose UNK UNK at the dish before her UNK STOP 
START i hope UNK bought them whole STOP 
START UNK stepped back her eyes UNK the tray for UNK STOP 
START then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm STOP 
START yes she said i remember that they came here every summer STOP 
START i used to play with the older one sometimes when he'd let me STOP 
START abel name fell with UNK UNK UNK from her lips STOP 
START for an instant the old aunt felt something UNK flash through her smile STOP 
START she would have said triumph STOP 
START then UNK turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen STOP 
START jessica packard lifted her head and followed the UNK figure her eyes resting nearly closed on the UNK rise and fall of the rounded UNK STOP 
START for a moment she held her face to the empty doorway she UNK and UNK for her fork STOP 
START there's no greater catastrophe in the universe she reflected UNK UNK tender green UNK on the silver fork than the UNK away of a family STOP 
START UNK expansion UNK these are the laws of living things with the penalty for not UNK them the ultimate in UNK UNK STOP 
START when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then the warm sweet butter UNK from her raised trembling fork and she pushed her head forward UNK ah then the true bitterness of existence could be UNK STOP 
START and indeed the young garden UNK were UNK in her mouth STOP 
START she was the last living of the older generation STOP 
START what had once been a widespread family at one time she knew there were enough UNK to UNK an entire county had now UNK down to the two boys abel and mark STOP 
START she swung her eyes up to the blue of the window her UNK gently UNK the bitter UNK STOP 
START what hope lay in the UNK she asked the UNK light out there with one married to a UNK woman and the other UNK having UNK two girl children with none to bear on the packard name ate STOP 
START it seemed to her as it seemed each night that the gloom drew itself in and became UNK at the UNK empty chairs giving her the frequent illusion that she UNK with shadows STOP 
START here too she talked low UNK her head at one or another of the places most often at UNK UNK which faced her across the long table STOP 
START or it might have been the absent UNK she addressed consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years STOP 
START she thought again of her children those two who had died young before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate UNK STOP 
START the girl her first she barely remembered STOP 
START it could have been UNK infant for it had not survived the UNK STOP 
START but the boy the boy had been alive yesterday STOP 
START each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the UNK film inside her STOP 
START he ran on his UNK sticks of legs freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the UNK photographs all carefully placed and glued and UNK resting in the fat UNK UNK in the bottom UNK of the UNK STOP 
START in the cruel UNK of her memory the boy remained UNK quick with the delight of laughter and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still UNK to her STOP 
START it was one with the UNK rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea STOP 
START the brothers drove down together in UNK small red sports car mark at the wheel STOP 
START they rarely spoke STOP 
START abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading out from both sides of the road rolled UNK up to where the silent white houses and long UNK and UNK UNK into the UNK fields STOP 
START he saw the land with a UNK eyes all the old UNK gone STOP 
START and it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger UNK complete in itself STOP 
START there was stability there too a color which his life had had once STOP 
START that is what childhood is he told himself STOP 
START solid settled lost STOP 
START in the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the UNK pen strokes of aunt UNK letter STOP 
START what bad grace what incredible UNK he and mark had shown STOP 
START the UNK summers preceding their UNK funeral might never have been STOP 
START they had closed over absolutely with the UNK of old UNK grave STOP 
START the small car flew on UNK STOP 
START the old woman UNK UNK in the house above the UNK waters took on an ominous reality STOP 
START abel moved and adjusted his long legs STOP 
START i suppose it has to do with the property mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their UNK of the letters STOP 
START not until the words had been spoken did abel suddenly see the old house and the UNK sea and feel his UNK UNK out in one UNK moment of UNK STOP 
START he and mark were the last of the family and there lay the cape ann property which had seemed to have no end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer STOP 
START now abel turned his head to look at his brother STOP 
START mark held the wheel loosely but his fingers UNK around it in a UNK way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come STOP 
START his UNK hair was already beginning to thin and UNK at the sides and abel looked quickly away STOP 
START mark easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably UNK STOP 
START the vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea STOP 
START she didn't mention bringing myra mark said UNK the car into the next lane STOP 
START she's probably getting old UNK i mean and we figured UNK better not STOP 
START they've never met you know STOP 
START but myra wouldn't UNK without an express invitation STOP 
START i feel kind of bad about it STOP 
START he gave abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel UNK it to him and abel caught this UNK of UNK to guilt STOP 
START i imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much mark added his eyes on the road STOP 
START abel ignored the UNK bid for UNK STOP 
START he smiled STOP 
START it was barely possible that his brother was right STOP 
START he could tell they were approaching the sea STOP 
START the air took on a special strength now that they'd left the UNK warmth of the UNK behind STOP 
START there was the smell of the coast like a UNK memory composed of equal parts salt water UNK UNK and northern air STOP 
START he turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an UNK boy's eye again the great UNK house which built on one of the many acres of UNK land UNK the west harbor had been UNK UNK to his UNK as the last century ended STOP 
START UNK thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own climbing the same UNK in dirty white UNK UNK out on top of the UNK and coming upon the sudden UNK water at the same instant STOP 
START remember the UNK mark asked and abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road the UNK white UNK which the car swallowed rapidly as it UNK the crest of the hill and came down STOP 
START the UNK abel said STOP 
START there was the day uncle UNK had in an unexpected UNK gesture handed over the pretty UNK to abel for keeps on condition that he never fail to let his brother UNK him whenever younger the boy wished STOP 
START the two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their UNK UNK them together as no other time or circumstance could STOP 
START they seemed then to have had a single mind and body a UNK which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually STOP 
START he saw the UNK as she lay her slender UNK up and gently turning its point describing constant UNK circles against a UNK sky STOP 
START both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting ready for the two of them to run up her UNK STOP 
START the UNK had been long at the bottom of the bay STOP 
START they came unexpectedly upon the sea STOP 
START meeting it without preparation as they did UNK of anticipation a common disappointment seized them STOP 
START they were climbing the hill in the night when the UNK abruptly UNK solid UNK became two parallel luminous tubes which UNK out into a faint mist of light and ended STOP 
START mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars STOP

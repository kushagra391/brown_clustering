START i UNK my head each time it appeared STOP 
START suddenly the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision son of a UNK sometimes UNK by vicious UNK of a beer bottle into UNK UNK ribs STOP 
START a big car was approaching its UNK teeth UNK STOP 
START beyond it the gray road stretched a long long way STOP 
START the car was just about to us its UNK fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in UNK UNK on anything but an old UNK truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue STOP

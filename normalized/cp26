START i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the UNK field far across the hill from the farm buildings STOP 
START it had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my UNK son would soon come across the broad black area of UNK ground carrying the jar of cool water STOP 
START the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water and he always dragged an old UNK UNK or a stick along to play with STOP 
START he UNK that the UNK was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make UNK tractor sounds with his lips STOP 
START i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time STOP 
START i had turned at the corner of the field and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway and when i looked again down the UNK the snake was there STOP 
START it lay half in the UNK and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the UNK STOP 
START the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped instantly STOP 
START the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made into the UNK and did not go any further STOP 
START i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic that i'd had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful STOP 
START he was UNK and UNK and he lay in the UNK and moved his arched and UNK head only so slightly STOP 
START go out of the UNK snake i said but it did not move at all STOP 
START i pulled the UNK of the tractor in and out hoping to frighten him with the noise but the snake only UNK its black UNK tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without UNK or concern STOP 
START i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it STOP 
START my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and UNK UNK a couple of feet and stopped again and its tongue was working very rapidly STOP 
START i followed it looking at the brilliant colors on its UNK back the colors clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown UNK the size of a UNK fist down its back and the UNK were set one within the other and UNK with UNK UNK STOP 
START the colors were UNK clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm STOP 
START the eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly STOP 
START his flat and UNK UNK head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth STOP 
START you beauty i said i couldn't kill you STOP 
START you are much too beautiful STOP 
START i had killed snakes before when i was younger but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was UNK that an animal such as that should die STOP 
START i picked him up and the length of him arched very carefully and UNK and only a little wildly and i could feel the UNK of that UNK UNK body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little UNK in the UNK of him like UNK swallowed whole might make STOP 
START the body UNK through my hands like cool UNK and my hands usually UNK and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the UNK of that body STOP 
START i lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool UNK earth from between my pale hands STOP 
START the snake worked away very slowly and UNK and with a UNK kind of dignity and beauty and he carried his head a little above the rolled UNK STOP 
START the sharp burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target STOP 
START i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake STOP 
START it UNK in its bright UNK color against the UNK UNK and the UNK black UNK of soil and against the UNK of myself STOP 
START the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and UNK field STOP 
START i got on the tractor again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long UNK and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks STOP 
START i had my back to the corner of the UNK field that pointed towards the house STOP 
START the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the UNK because they were not UNK properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake STOP 
START i saw it all at a glance STOP 
START the boy was there at the lower corner of the field and he was in the UNK earth UNK with UNK and a kind of UNK UNK STOP 
START even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the UNK mark of brutality on the boy STOP 
START i could see the UNK shoulders the savage determination the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels and the UNK of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick STOP 
START stop it i shouted but the UNK and mighty tractor roared on above anything i could say STOP 
START i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear and still but he did not even UNK in that UNK UNK dance STOP 
START it was no use STOP 
START i felt myself UNK thinking of the UNK light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted to run down there and UNK if i could that UNK UNK catch the boy in the moment of his UNK and save a UNK a UNK of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late STOP 
START i drove the tractor on not looking down there was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on STOP 
START my head began to UNK and the UNK of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful things and these are soon UNK or they UNK STOP 
START i felt the anger mount within me STOP 
START the boy waited at the corner with the jar of water held up to me in his hands and the water had grown UNK in the heat of the morning STOP 
START i knew the boy well STOP 
START he was eleven and we had done many things together STOP 
START he was a beautiful boy really with UNK blonde hair and a smooth and still UNK face and his UNK were long and dark and UNK and his eyes were blue STOP 
START he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would smile on any other day STOP 
START he was my UNK my UNK son handsome and warm and UNK with happiness upon his face and his face UNK my UNK and mine as well STOP 
START i saw then too the stake driven straight and hard into the UNK soil through something there where i had been not long before STOP 
START i stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me STOP 
START can i ride around with you asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me STOP 
START i looked closely at his eyes and he was already innocent killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his STOP 
START no you cannot i said pushing aside the water jar he offered to me STOP 
START i pointed to the UNK upright stake STOP 
START did you do that asked STOP 
START yes he said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement STOP 
START i killed a snake was a big one STOP 
START he tried to take my hand to show me STOP 
START why did you kill it snakes are ugly and bad STOP 
START this snake was very beautiful STOP 
START didn't you see how beautiful it was snakes are ugly he said again STOP 
START you saw the colors of it didn't you you ever seen anything like it around here snakes are ugly and bad and it might have UNK somebody and they would have died STOP 
START you know there are no UNK snakes in this area STOP 
START this snake could not harm anything STOP 
START they eat chickens sometimes the boy said STOP 
START they are ugly and they eat chickens and i hate snakes STOP 
START you are talking UNK i said STOP 
START you killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason STOP 
START they're ugly and i hate them the boy insisted STOP 
START nobody likes snakes STOP 
START it was beautiful i said half to myself STOP 
START the boy UNK along beside me and he was UNK with what he had done STOP 
START the fire of the colors was gone was a UNK UNK now colors of its back were dull and UNK torn and smashed in and dirty from the boy's shoes STOP 
START the UNK head so delicate and so cool had been UNK as if in a UNK and the UNK tongue UNK out of the twisted torn mouth STOP 
START the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life STOP 
START i UNK the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the UNK part of its body between the colored UNK UNK STOP 
START i touched it and the UNK the UNK was gone and even then it moved a little perhaps a tiny UNK of the dead muscles and i hoped that it was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it STOP 
START and then it moved a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have to kill it there STOP 
START the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing UNK in circles making the UNK tractor sound with his lips STOP 
START i'm sorry i thought to the snake for you were beautiful STOP 
START i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the UNK from the UNK and i struck its head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live STOP 
START the boy came around behind me dragging the stake STOP 
START it's a big snake isn't it said STOP 
START i'm going to tell everybody how big a snake i killed STOP 
START don't you see what you have done said STOP 
START don't you see the difference now it's an ugly terrible snake he said STOP 
START he came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes STOP 
START i could see the happiness in the boy's eyes the UNK brutality STOP 
START don't i said STOP 
START i could have UNK the boy STOP 
START he looked up at me puzzled and he UNK his head from side to side STOP 
START i thought you little UNK you UNK UNK little UNK with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes STOP 
START i wanted to UNK his face to UNK forever the UNK and UNK UNK from his mouth and i decided then very suddenly what i would do STOP

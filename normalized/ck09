START it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began STOP 
START the rider from UNK was as good as his word STOP 
START he came UNK and UNK down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust shouting they're UNK god they're UNK they are heard him before he ever showed and we heard him UNK after he was out of sight STOP 
START UNK chandler hadn't UNK the strength of his lungs not at all STOP 
START i think you could have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every UNK with importance STOP 
START i have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there STOP 
START that's understandable and i appreciate the sentiment STOP 
START as for this rider i never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him UNK so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes i can't say i do know that he gave the day tone and distinction STOP 
START the last thing in the world that UNK a war was our line of farmers and UNK and mechanics UNK on top of a stone wall and this UNK rider made us feel a good deal UNK and more alert to the situation STOP 
START we came down off the wall as if he had UNK all of us and we crouched behind it STOP 
START i have heard people talk with contempt about the british UNK but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are UNK ignorant STOP 
START whatever we felt about the UNK we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing i know that i myself was UNK with apprehension and fear and that my hands were UNK wet where they held my gun STOP 
START i wanted to UNK my UNK but i didn't dare to the state my hands were in just as i didn't dare to do anything about the UNK STOP 
START the gun would fire or not just as chance UNK STOP 
START i put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun because the most important thing i had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it STOP 
START the UNK which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty in that brief interval a UNK officer came UNK down the road UNK his horse fit to kill STOP 
START i don't know whether he was after our rider who had gone by a minute before or whether he was simply UNK conditions when he passed us by a UNK roared and he UNK his horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come STOP 
START he was a fine and UNK rider but his skill was wasted on us STOP 
START from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked STOP 
START the UNK officer collapsed like a UNK UNK and the horse UNK and threw him from the saddle except that one UNK foot caught in the UNK STOP 
START half UNK by the weight dragging the dust and the heat the horse leaped our wall UNK out the UNK brains against it and leaving him lying there among us while the horse crashed away through the brush STOP 
START it was my UNK to war and the insane symphony war plays what had happened on the common was only terror and flight this UNK broken head not ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had become STOP 
START and now the UNK were coming and the UNK was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us STOP 
START i must state that the faster things happened the UNK they happened passage and rhythm of time changed and when i remember back to what happened then each event is a separate and frozen incident STOP 
START in my UNK there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the UNK UNK and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to UNK UNK STOP 
START yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front of the british army came into view STOP 
START it was only hours since i had last seen them but they had changed and i had changed STOP 
START in the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along UNK blood behind them STOP 
START no UNK here no UNK and the red UNK were covered with a fine film of dust STOP 
START they UNK with UNK fixed and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and UNK STOP 
START rank after rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same and they walked in a sea of dust STOP 
START UNK hold your fire your fire voice called and what made it even more terrible and UNK was that the UNK ranks never paused for an instant only some of them UNK toward the stone wall from behind which the voice came STOP 
START the front of their column had already passed us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not five UNK from where we were STOP 
START my cousin UNK carried a UNK but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite him he rose up behind the wall and fired STOP 
START one moment there was a man in the saddle next a UNK horror on a horse that UNK through the UNK ranks and during the next second or two we all of us fired into the suddenly UNK column of soldiers STOP 
START one moment the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four with a purpose as UNK as death next a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the UNK soldiers emerged with their UNK and their UNK fury STOP 
START in the course of this they had fired on us i have no memory of that STOP 
START i had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my UNK it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry UNK then i was adding my own voice to the UNK of sound UNK more UNK language than i ever thought i knew UNK and shouting and aware that if i had passed water before it was not enough for my UNK were UNK wet STOP 
START i would have stood there and died there if left to myself but cousin UNK grabbed my arm in his UNK grip and fairly UNK me out of there then i came to some UNK and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that i UNK cousin UNK by far STOP 
START everyone else was running STOP 
START later we realized that the UNK had stopped their charge at the wall STOP 
START their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching STOP 
START we tumbled to a stop in UNK UNK cow hole a UNK bit of pasture with a UNK pool of water in its middle STOP 
START a dozen cows UNK sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter the UNK and shooting still continuing up at the road and the UNK of some of the men which was so great that they UNK into the UNK water and UNK up UNK of it STOP 
START UNK UNK one of the men from lincoln had taken a UNK ball in his belly though he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on the ground dying the reverend holding his head and UNK his hot UNK STOP 
START it may appear that we were cruel and UNK but no one had time to spend UNK with poor UNK except the reverend STOP 
START i know that i myself felt that it was a UNK shame for a man to be torn open by a british UNK ball as UNK had been yet i also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself STOP 
START i was drunk with excitement and the smell of UNK that came floating down from the road and the fact that i was not afraid now but only waiting to know what to do next STOP 
START meanwhile i UNK my gun as the other men were doing STOP 
START we were less than a quarter of a mile from the road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it STOP 
START wherever you looked you saw UNK running across the UNK some away from the road some toward it some parallel to it about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia were making their way in our direction STOP 
START cousin UNK and some others felt that we should march toward UNK and take up new positions ahead of the UNK british column but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road STOP 
START i didn't offer any advice but i certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains UNK out STOP 
START someone said that while we were standing here and UNK about it the british would be gone cousin UNK said he had watched them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much UNK pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with the UNK of the road and their UNK and ammunition UNK STOP 
START while this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west of us UNK out and breaking into little UNK of two and three men as they approached the road STOP 
START it was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the UNK who had been in the battle of the north bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status and we felt that if they employed this UNK it was likely enough the best one STOP 
START UNK UNK said it makes sense STOP 
START if we cluster together the UNK can make an advantage out of it but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us and we can UNK them STOP 
START that settled it and we broke into parties of two and three STOP 
START cousin UNK UNK decided to remain with the reverend and poor UNK UNK until life passed away and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world STOP 
START i went off with cousin UNK who maintained that if he didn't see to me he didn't know who would STOP 
START good UNK adam he said i thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place STOP 
START i learned that now i said STOP 
START we ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road UNK from the effort and UNK with sweat STOP 
START there was a UNK of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road and the shouting and UNK never UNK STOP 
START under the trees there was a dead UNK a young boy with a UNK white skin and a face full of UNK who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes STOP 
START three men were around him STOP 
START they had stripped him of his UNK and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off STOP 
START cousin UNK grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away STOP 
START god's name what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on UNK roared STOP 
START they tried to UNK him but joseph UNK was as wide as two average men and it would have taken UNK men than these were to UNK him STOP

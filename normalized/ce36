START there comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone STOP 
START not necessarily to be off all by ourselves but away from the crowds and common UNK STOP 
START if you've UNK in europe a time or two it is quite certain that you've had that UNK feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the atlantic STOP 
START following a guide and UNK so is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new STOP 
START however after you've seen all the historical UNK and UNK the places and UNK the churches and UNK the UNK and UNK and begin to feel at home in the UNK of europe you'll want to change your course and follow the UNK at will far from the market places STOP 
START the champagne at UNK the traditional capital of the champagne country has more UNK taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the UNK de la UNK or at tour UNK STOP 
START you can UNK history and follow in fancy the UNK in their quest for the holy UNK as they sail out from UNK an ancient town in the UNK of UNK boot STOP 
START and you don't meet the folks from home in northwest UNK which has remained almost UNK by time and tourists since the middle ages STOP 
START time stands still as you climb the narrow stone UNK in tiny villages UNK to steep mountain UNK or UNK through UNK towns UNK UNK UNK UNK their faces turned to the sea STOP 
START they've been there since the days of the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START and what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and UNK in a UNK but charming UNK village on the UNK almost UNK way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road STOP 
START for those who need or want and can afford another car buying one and driving it on the grand tour then shipping it home is one popular plan for a UNK UNK STOP 
START then of course there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car STOP 
START the answer to this UNK is to pick up a telephone and UNK to rent one STOP 
START it is that elemental STOP 
START almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you STOP 
START you can call one of the car rental services directly UNK UNK UNK UNK rental and others and ask them to reserve a car of your choice and some transportation lines offer this service as well STOP 
START with few exceptions your car will be waiting for you at UNK airport railroad station or hotel when you arrive UNK at no additional cost STOP 
START you can wait of course until you arrive in europe before UNK your car STOP 
START the UNK to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or during the busy tourist season when cars are in great demand you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all STOP 
START since charges are relatively the same UNK a car before you leave for europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it STOP 
START for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city or even another country when you are ready to return home STOP 
START at some cities this UNK and delivery service is without additional charge and if you are UNK when you are planning your UNK you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger european countries STOP 
START international UNK documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and UNK data STOP 
START a valid american driving license is accepted in all countries except UNK UNK UNK and eastern europe STOP 
START if you plan to visit any of these countries you can obtain your international driving permit before you leave at a nominal fee around UNK STOP 
START your insurance too with most agencies is provided with the car covering comprehensive fire UNK UNK and UNK with a UNK UNK which varies in different countries STOP 
START if you would feel happier with full UNK insurance there is a small additional charge again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance STOP 
START the average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly UNK a day STOP 
START the charge is variable however and goes as low as UNK a day in ireland and as high as UNK a day in greece STOP 
START rental fees are variable too throughout the countries of europe STOP 
START there are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available STOP 
START as in the united states there is a flat UNK rental charge plus a few cents per UNK driven and the UNK rate drops if the car is retained for a week STOP 
START it drops again after fifteen and UNK days STOP 
START it is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from UNK to UNK for the equivalent of a united states UNK and while you might prefer a familiar ford UNK or even a UNK which are available in some countries it is probably UNK to choose the smaller european makes which average thirty thirty-five and even forty miles to the UNK STOP 
START your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people UNK in your group STOP 
START with the exception of the sports cars even the quite tiny UNK will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and UNK space for really economical transportation STOP 
START there is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries however including UNK UNK and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that much greater than for the UNK UNK STOP 
START the basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car but some of them offer UNK advantages STOP 
START there is the free UNK rent it here leave it there service as an example the free delivery and collection at the airport UNK or your hotel UNK UNK UNK documents and information and other similar services STOP 
START a little investigation by telephone or reading the travel UNK in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional UNK benefits STOP 
START the investigation will be well worth your time STOP 
START all model cars are not available in all countries STOP 
START quite naturally there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country STOP 
START if you would like to start your tour in italy where the rental fees are actually the lowest in europe UNK in all sizes are available as are UNK UNK UNK models STOP 
START if you wish to budget closely on transportation saving your extra dollars to UNK in UNK one agency lists the small fiat 500 at only UNK a day plus UNK a UNK and the fiat UNK station wagon UNK six at just UNK a day and UNK a UNK STOP 
START if you will be using your car more than fifteen days which isn't all unlikely the daily rates drop quite sharply to UNK a day for the fiat 500 and to an UNK UNK a day for the fiat UNK station wagon STOP 
START with six in the group the cost comes to just a UNK a day per person on the daily fee STOP 
START in the majority of countries however the rates range from UNK to UNK a day for the smaller UNK and graduate up to UNK and UNK a day for the larger luxury european models with the rate per UNK driven starting at UNK and going up as high as UNK STOP 
START the same model car might be available in six or eight countries yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per UNK driven STOP 
START the variations are not too great STOP 
START rates for american cars are somewhat higher ranging from about UNK a day up to UNK a day for a UNK UNK but the rate per UNK driven is roughly the same as for the larger european models STOP 
START rates in greece and UNK are fairly high actually the highest in europe and surprisingly enough they are also quite high in ireland STOP 
START if you are planning to tour europe for longer than a month it might be wise for you to UNK a car STOP 
START the actual over-all cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time but you will receive a new car STOP 
START you will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner which includes the factory UNK and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout europe STOP 
START further there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you UNK a car and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and UNK individually for your trip STOP 
START there is a fairly wide selection of models of english german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 UNK 2 UNK UNK UNK to the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK a car is not as common or as popular as UNK a car in europe but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory STOP 
START after the first month rates are considerably less UNK only about UNK a month for most UNK and UNK models STOP 
START there are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the UNK plan STOP 
START for one thing the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road STOP 
START then too european drivers have UNK for being somewhat crazy on the road and some americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them STOP 
START still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car STOP 
START the way is to rent a UNK car STOP 
START it isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be STOP 
START your UNK expenses will average between UNK to UNK a day but this charge is the same whether you rent a UNK UNK UNK or a UNK UNK or fiat UNK STOP 
START the big spread is in the charge for each UNK driven being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed STOP 
START since most european cars average more miles per UNK of gasoline than american cars it naturally follows that the cost per UNK for these models will be less but the greater UNK capacity of the large american cars will UNK this provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a UNK UNK STOP 
START the fees for the rental of UNK cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the UNK cars STOP 
START however whether you UNK to have a european or american model if you rent a car with the proper UNK capacity in relation to the number of people in your party your transportation expense will average very close to UNK per day per passenger STOP 
START this will include your helpful UNK UNK and a drive of an average of UNK UNK in any one day STOP 
START if you drive greater distances than that you'll just be UNK the surface and will never discover the UNK UNK and beauty which UNK you in the first place to explore the UNK STOP 
START of course if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an imperial or UNK UNK just for you and your bride you'll have a memorable tour but it won't be cheap and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a UNK in the irish UNK STOP

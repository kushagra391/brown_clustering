START control of UNK status it would have been desirable for the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable being investigated the degree of structure in teaching method STOP 
START the structured schools were in an industrial city with UNK UNK houses typical of the residential areas but with one rather sizable section of middle-class homes STOP 
START the unstructured schools were in a large suburban community UNK UNK to UNK class but UNK by an industrial area STOP 
START in order to UNK the samples on UNK status we chose schools in both cities on the basis of UNK status of the neighborhoods STOP 
START school UNK and guidance workers made UNK of the various neighborhoods and the research team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas STOP 
START an objective scale was developed for UNK school neighborhoods from these data STOP 
START equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from UNK and UNK class neighborhoods STOP 
START subjects individual differences in UNK and the development of readiness for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school achievement STOP 
START therefore UNK children were chosen as subjects for this study STOP 
START for purposes of sample selection only individual tests were given later we obtained group test scores of reading achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire UNK population in each school system STOP 
START the subjects for this study were UNK selected from UNK areas of the distribution one-third as UNK one-third medium and one-third UNK STOP 
START children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation below the UNK line of each total UNK school population were considered UNK for the purposes of sample selection STOP 
START UNK were at least one standard deviation above the UNK line in their school system STOP 
START the final sample was not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement or intelligence test scores STOP 
START twenty-four UNK in twelve unstructured schools furnished UNK cases UNK boys and UNK girls STOP 
START eight UNK in three structured schools furnished UNK cases UNK boys and UNK girls STOP 
START administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size in the structured schools STOP 
START it was assumed that the sampling procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables under investigation STOP 
START UNK scale of compulsivity an interview schedule of UNK questions and a UNK questionnaire were prepared and one parent of each of the sample children was seen in the home STOP 
START the parent was asked to describe the child's typical behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity to observe UNK toward UNK in demands upon self and others UNK conformity to rules UNK UNK and need for certainty STOP 
START the UNK were instructed not to suggest answers and as much as possible to record the UNK actual words as they described the child's behavior in home situations STOP 
START the UNK scale of compulsivity was constructed by first UNK the interview records UNK all evidence related to compulsivity then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the case records STOP 
START final UNK were made on the basis of a point system which was developed after studying the UNK of actual UNK recorded and UNK weight values to each type of behavior that was UNK from the discovered norms STOP 
START children UNK high in compulsivity were those who gave evidence of tension or UNK in situations where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards and expectations or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals STOP 
START the low UNK child was one who appeared relatively UNK about such matters STOP 
START for instance the following statement was UNK low in compulsivity she's naturally quite neat about things but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets UNK STOP 
START but she UNK it up very well when i remind her STOP 
START measurement of anxiety UNK et al revised the taylor anxiety scale for use with children STOP 
START the taylor scale was adapted from the minnesota UNK personality inventory with item selection based upon clinical UNK of anxiety STOP 
START there is much research evidence to UNK the use of the instrument in UNK individuals who are likely to UNK anxiety in varying degrees STOP 
START UNK and UNK work with the children's anxiety scale by UNK et al demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with the adult scale STOP 
START although the taylor scale was designed as a group testing device in this study it was individually administered by UNK trained workers who established UNK and UNK the children in reading the items STOP 
START relationship of anxiety to compulsivity the question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity STOP 
START the two UNK yield a correlation of which is not significantly different from zero we have measured two different characteristics STOP 
START in theory UNK behavior is a way of UNK anxiety and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many children the UNK defenses are not sufficient to UNK the amount of anxiety they suffer STOP 
START the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later STOP 
START criterion measurement in the primary grades reading UNK almost every aspect of school progress and the children's early experiences of success or failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement that is relatively UNK throughout the following years STOP 
START in establishing criterion measurements it was therefore thought best to UNK the scope beyond the reading act itself STOP 
START the predicted interaction effect should if UNK extend its influence over all academic achievement STOP 
START the UNK achievement test form UNK was administered by classroom teachers consisting of a battery of six UNK paragraph meaning word meaning UNK language UNK UNK and UNK reasoning STOP 
START all of these UNK involve reading except UNK UNK STOP 
START scores are stated in UNK on a national UNK STOP 
START the battery UNK UNK was used in data analysis in this study STOP 
START the UNK intelligence scale for children was administered to each sample UNK child by a clinical worker STOP 
START the relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a UNK fact in this case af in the investigation of the present hypothesis it was necessary to control this factor STOP 
START the criterion score used in the statistical analysis is an index of UNK or UNK STOP 
START it is the discrepancy between the actual UNK achievement test score and the score that would be predicted by the UNK STOP 
START for example on the basis of the UNK equation a child with an UNK of UNK in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement test score of UNK grade equivalent STOP 
START if a child with an UNK of UNK scored UNK in achievement his discrepancy score would be representing of one year of UNK STOP 
START a child with an UNK of UNK would be expected to earn an achievement test score of UNK STOP 
START if such a child scored UNK his discrepancy score would be UNK representing of one year of UNK STOP 
START in this manner the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled allowing discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting from other variables STOP 
START results test of interaction of compulsivity and teaching methods tables 1 and 2 present the results of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the UNK variable STOP 
START figure 1 UNK the mean achievement scores of each UNK UNK STOP 
START first of all as we had UNK the highly UNK children in the structured setting score significantly better af on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured schools STOP 
START it can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity within the structured schools the high UNK children do better af STOP 
START no significant difference was found in achievement between high and low UNK children within the unstructured school STOP 
START the hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported in this case at the level STOP 
START while we had expected that UNK children in the unstructured school setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high UNK within the schools where the UNK method is used in beginning reading UNK favorably with that of the low UNK STOP 
START indeed their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis although the difference was not significant STOP 
START we UNK that UNK in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of the lack of UNK in their school setting but that their need to organize for comfort is so intense that they struggle to UNK the UNK rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment STOP 
START it is interesting to note that medium UNK in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores although not significantly lower STOP 
START possibly their compulsivity was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure STOP 
START our UNK is then that regardless of the manner in which school lessons are taught the UNK child UNK those elements of each lesson that aid him in UNK his work STOP 
START when helped by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then does such a child attain unusual success STOP 
START test of interaction of anxiety and teaching methods the statistical analyses of achievement in relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the UNK of the two are presented in tables 3 and 4 STOP 
START figure 2 is a graph of the mean achievement scores of each group STOP 
START as predicted the highly anxious children in the unstructured schools score more poorly af than those in the structured schools STOP 
START the interaction effect which is significant at the level can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores STOP 
START while high anxiety children achieve significantly less well af in the unstructured school than do low anxiety children they appear to do at least as well as the average in the structured classroom STOP 
START the most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked UNK in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured schools STOP 
START according to the theory proposed this is a consequence of the severe condition of perceived threat that UNK UNK for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment STOP 
START the fact that such threat is UNK in the beginning reading lessons is thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or UNK these children exhibit STOP 
START the child with high anxiety may first direct his UNK energy toward achievement but because his distress severely UNK the abilities of discrimination and UNK of complex symbols the child may fail in his initial attempts to master the problem STOP 
START failure UNK the threat and the intensity of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more difficult so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the UNK in performance is pronounced STOP 
START the individual with high anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination STOP 
START but the symbols he is asked to learn are simple STOP 
START as shown earlier the highly anxious individual may be superior in his UNK of simple elements STOP 
START success UNK the prospect of threat and his powers of discrimination are improved STOP 
START by the time the child first attacks the actual problem of reading he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements of words STOP 
START apparently academic challenge in the structured setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state without becoming confused or UNK STOP 
START UNK et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the UNK situation and that his performance will be UNK unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher STOP 
START although the present study was not a direct UNK of their investigations the results do not confirm their conclusion STOP 
START observers in the two school systems studied here judged the teachers in the structured schools to be more impersonal and demanding while the atmosphere in the unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting STOP 
START yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous UNK only in the unstructured school and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting STOP

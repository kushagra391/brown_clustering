START he brought with him a mixture of UNK and UNK of about a hundred UNK weight STOP 
START they took UNK body then and wrapped it in UNK with the UNK is how the jews prepare a body for burial STOP 
START listed as present at the descent were mary UNK sister mary UNK john joseph of UNK UNK STOP 
START search as he might he could find no place where the bible spoke of a moment when mary could have been alone with jesus STOP 
START mostly the scene was crowded with UNK such as the dramatic UNK UNK in UNK where the UNK spectators had UNK UNK last UNK moment STOP 
START in his concept there could be no one else present STOP 
START his first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe STOP 
START when might mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap after the soldiers had laid him on the ground while joseph of UNK was at UNK UNK asking for christ's body UNK was gathering his mixture of UNK and UNK and the others had gone home to UNK STOP 
START those who saw his finished UNK would take the place of the biblical witnesses STOP 
START they would feel what mary was undergoing STOP 
START there would be no UNK no angels STOP 
START these would be two human beings whom god had chosen STOP 
START he felt close to mary having spent so long UNK on the beginning of her journey STOP 
START now she was UNK alive UNK son was dead STOP 
START even though he would later be UNK he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross STOP 
START in his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt for his mother what mary felt for her son STOP 
START UNK UNK body would be passive his eyes closed STOP 
START mary would have to carry the human communication STOP 
START this seemed right to him STOP 
START it was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems STOP 
START since his christ was to be life size how was mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming UNK mary would be slender of UNK and delicate of proportion yet she must hold this UNK man as UNK and UNK as she would a child STOP 
START there was only one way to accomplish this by design by drawing UNK and sketches in which he UNK the UNK corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept STOP 
START he started by making free sketches to UNK up his thinking so that images would appear on paper STOP 
START UNK these UNK what he was feeling within himself STOP 
START at the same time he started walking the streets UNK at the people passing or shopping at the UNK UNK up fresh impressions of what they looked like how they moved STOP 
START in particular he sought the gentle UNK UNK with head UNK and UNK coming to the middle of their UNK remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper STOP 
START UNK that UNK could be designed to serve structural purposes he began a study of the UNK of UNK STOP 
START he UNK as he went along completing a UNK clay figure then bought yards of an UNK material from a UNK wet the UNK cloth in a UNK and covered it over with clay that argiento brought from the bank of the UNK to the consistency of thick mud STOP 
START no UNK could be UNK each turn of the UNK had to serve UNK to cover the UNK slender legs and feet so that they would give UNK support to christ's body to UNK her inner turmoil STOP 
START when the cloth dried and UNK he saw what adjustments had to be made STOP 
START so that's sculpture commented argiento UNK when he had UNK down the floor for a week making mud UNK STOP 
START michelangelo grinned STOP 
START see argiento if you control the way these UNK are UNK like this or made to flow you can UNK the body attitudes STOP 
START they can have as much UNK appeal as flesh and bone STOP 
START he went into the jewish quarter wanting to draw UNK faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how christ might have looked STOP 
START the jewish section was in UNK near the UNK at the church of san UNK a UNK STOP 
START the colony had been small until the spanish UNK of UNK drove many jews into rome STOP 
START here for the most part they were well treated as a UNK of the old testament heritage of christianity of their gifted members were prominent in the UNK as UNK musicians bankers STOP 
START the men did not object to his UNK them while they went about their work but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose STOP 
START he was told to ask for rabbi UNK at the UNK on saturday afternoon STOP 
START michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes UNK in black UNK with a UNK on his head STOP 
START he was reading from the UNK with a group of men from his congregation STOP 
START when michelangelo explained why he had come rabbi UNK replied UNK the bible UNK us to bow down to or to make UNK images STOP 
START that is why our creative people give their time to literature not to painting or sculpture STOP 
START but rabbi UNK you don't object to others creating works of art not at all STOP 
START each religion has its own UNK STOP 
START i am UNK a UNK from white UNK marble STOP 
START i wish to make jesus an authentic jew STOP 
START i cannot accomplish this if you will not help me STOP 
START the rabbi said thoughtfully i would not want my people to get in trouble with the church STOP 
START i am working for the cardinal of san UNK STOP 
START i'm sure he would approve STOP 
START what kind of models would you prefer UNK STOP 
START in their UNK STOP 
START not UNK UNK but UNK men STOP 
START with intelligence STOP 
START and sensitivity STOP 
START rabbi UNK smiled at him with UNK old but UNK eyes STOP 
START leave me your address STOP 
START i will send you the best the quarter has to offer STOP 
START michelangelo hurried to UNK solitary UNK room with his sketches asked the architect to design a stand which would UNK the seated UNK STOP 
START UNK studied the drawings and UNK a UNK couch STOP 
START michelangelo bought some UNK lumber STOP 
START together he and argiento built the stand covering it with blankets STOP 
START his first model arrived at UNK STOP 
START he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked him to UNK so michelangelo gave him a piece of UNK to UNK around his UNK led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes STOP 
START he then UNK him over the rough stand explained that he was supposed to be recently dead and was being held on his mother's lap STOP 
START the model quite plainly thought michelangelo crazy the instructions from his rabbi kept him from UNK STOP 
START but at the end of the sitting when michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the mother UNK in holding her son the model grasped what michelangelo was after and promised to speak to his friends STOP 
START he worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi STOP 
START mary presented quite a different problem STOP 
START though this sculpture must take place UNK years after her moment of decision he could not conceive of her as a woman in her UNK old wrinkled broken in body and face by labor or worry STOP 
START his image of the virgin had always been that of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother STOP 
START UNK UNK introduced him into several roman homes STOP 
START here he UNK sitting in their flowing UNK of UNK and silk young girls not yet twenty some about to be married some married a year or two STOP 
START since the UNK UNK hospital had taken only men he had had no experience in the study of female UNK he had UNK the women of UNK in their fields and homes STOP 
START he was able to UNK the body lines of the roman women under their UNK STOP 
START he spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together a mary who would be young and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap a jesus who though lean was strong even in death a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of UNK UNK STOP 
START he drew toward the composite design from his UNK accurate memory without need to consult his sketches STOP 
START soon he was ready to go into a UNK figure in clay STOP 
START here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to UNK forms STOP 
START when he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or UNK clay STOP 
START next he turned to wax because there was a UNK of wax to marble in UNK quality and UNK STOP 
START he respected each of these approach techniques and kept them in character his UNK drawings had a UNK suggesting skin texture clay he used UNK to suggest soft moving flesh as in an UNK in a UNK UNK wax he UNK over to give the body surface an UNK pull STOP 
START yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind remained rough starting points STOP 
START when UNK he was charged with spontaneous energy careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere UNK of his model STOP 
START the true UNK had to be inside the marble itself STOP 
START drawing and models were his thinking STOP 
START UNK was action STOP 
START 10 STOP 
START -hlthe arrangement with argiento was working well except that sometimes michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice STOP 
START argiento had been trained so UNK by the UNK that michelangelo was unable to change his habits up before dawn to UNK the floors whether they were dirty or not UNK on the fire for washing UNK every day the UNK UNK with river sand after each meal STOP 
START argiento this is UNK he complained not liking to work on the wet floors particularly in cold weather STOP 
START you're too clean STOP 
START UNK the studio once a week STOP 
START that's enough STOP 
START no said argiento UNK STOP 
START every day STOP 
START before dawn STOP 
START i was taught STOP 
START and god help anyone who tries to UNK you michelangelo he knew that he had nothing to UNK about for argiento made few demands on him STOP 
START the boy was becoming acquainted with the UNK families that brought produce into rome STOP 
START on UNK he would walk miles into the UNK to visit with them and in particular to see their horses STOP 
START the one thing he missed from his farm in the UNK valley was the animals he would take his leave of michelangelo by UNK today i go see the horses STOP 
START it took a piece of bad luck to show michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him STOP 
START he was crouched over his UNK in the UNK getting his UNK into trim when a UNK of steel flew into his eye and UNK itself in his pupil STOP 
START he stumbled into the house eyes burning like fire STOP 
START argiento made him lie down on the bed brought a pan of hot water UNK some clean white UNK cloth and applied it to UNK the UNK STOP 
START though the pain was considerable michelangelo was not too concerned STOP 
START he assumed he could UNK the UNK out STOP 
START but it would not come STOP 
START argiento never left his side keeping the water UNK applying hot UNK throughout the night STOP 
START by the second day michelangelo began to worry by the second night he was in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the UNK eye STOP 
START at dawn argiento went to UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK arrived with his family surgeon UNK UNK STOP 
START the surgeon carried a UNK of live UNK STOP 
START he told argiento to take a bird out of the UNK cut a large vein under its wing let the blood UNK into UNK injured eye STOP 
START the surgeon came back at UNK cut the vein of a second UNK again washed out the eye STOP

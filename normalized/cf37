START the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to UNK individuals and voluntary societies STOP 
START but the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as UNK in its essential life STOP 
START the christian education of children too was once hardly more than a UNK but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full UNK of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty STOP 
START the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each UNK and a few UNK UNK STOP 
START most UNK and UNK even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their UNK STOP 
START they may even UNK it from their minds as something that concerns only the UNK UNK boys as someone has UNK them who like to go to national and international assemblies and have expense accounts that permit them to do so STOP 
START as long as this point of view UNK the ecumenical movement will be UNK and UNK STOP 
START the next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community STOP 
START progress will take place far less through what is done in any summit conference of the national council or the world council or even in offices of the UNK boards than through what happens in the communities where christian people live together as neighbors STOP 
START the front line of advance is where UNK and UNK congregations of different traditions exist side by side STOP 
START until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes programs and relationships it will have an inevitable aspect of UNK STOP 
START as things now stand there is a UNK UNK between the unity in christ which we UNK in ecumenical meetings and the UNK UNK of most congregations on any main street in the nation STOP 
START the ecumenical congregation the UNK of ecumenical advance is an even more UNK matter than the relation between congregations in the same community STOP 
START the decisive question is what happens within each congregation and finally in the minds and hearts of the individual members STOP 
START it is here that the local and ecumenical must meet STOP 
START it is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical STOP 
START it has become almost UNK to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the grass roots STOP 
START this way of describing the matter is unfortunate STOP 
START it implies two UNK STOP 
START one is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only to be understood at the so-called lower levels STOP 
START the truth however is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world STOP 
START the other UNK is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its UNK connections now UNK by many national leaders can be UNK to all congregations STOP 
START however needed this may be the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world STOP 
START the basic unit in the church of whatever UNK UNK is always the congregation STOP 
START it is hardly possible to emphasize this too much STOP 
START most people do not realize that the congregation as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another is unique STOP 
START the idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken STOP 
START the jewish UNK UNK a parallel to the christian congregation but UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK although they have sacred scriptures priests spiritual UNK and places of prayer do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love STOP 
START their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an UNK or a UNK rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship STOP 
START how far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the new testament means by UNK is now called christian fellowship is often little more than the social UNK of having a UNK time with the kind of people one likes STOP 
START the UNK of acts and of the UNK means sharing in a common relation to christ STOP 
START it is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate UNK of christ in his people STOP 
START as UNK UNK puts it our community with one another consists solely in what christ has done to both of us STOP 
START this may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom on the level of merely human UNK we might prefer not to have any association at all STOP 
START there is a vast difference between the community of UNK which the new testament describes and the community of UNK found in the average church building STOP 
START whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal church in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participating in his mission to the world a necessary UNK of the ecumenical movement has been laid STOP 
START the UNK of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists STOP 
START the local and the ecumenical are one STOP 
START of course the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place STOP 
START each viewpoint is valid if it is UNK related to the other STOP 
START neither is adequate if it stands alone STOP 
START our difficulty arises when either viewpoint UNK out the other STOP 
START and this is what all too often happens STOP 
START UNK UNK a little UNK UNK of this truth is afforded by an incident related by professor UNK UNK at the end of the second world war STOP 
START with great difficulty he made his way from his native UNK to geneva to UNK his contacts as a member of the UNK committee for the world council of churches STOP 
START when he had the UNK of breaking his UNK his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones STOP 
START they were UNK STOP 
START he often spoke of them as his ecumenical glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church STOP 
START it is he said a UNK vision which can see both the UNK and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both STOP 
START as things stand now the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other STOP 
START on the one hand there are UNK who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town STOP 
START they do not escape the UNK into which charles dickens UNK mrs. UNK as falling STOP 
START her concern for the natives of UNK was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son UNK the UNK may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the UNK state in east germany the UNK situation of the church in revolutionary china and the UNK of the church over UNK in south africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its UNK but indispensable ministry of worship UNK service and UNK and christian UNK for a UNK group of individuals STOP 
START on the other hand many a pastor is so absorbed in UNK to the intimate personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission STOP 
START as a result they go on thinking of the church with UNK and UNK satisfaction only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families STOP 
START it would hardly be an UNK to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members STOP 
START the parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world STOP 
START the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most UNK in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs STOP 
START it is UNK successful according to all conventional standards STOP 
START it is growing in numbers STOP 
START its people are agreeable friends STOP 
START it has a beautiful UNK STOP 
START its preaching and its music give UNK of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain STOP 
START it provides UNK care for the sick and troubled STOP 
START it helps children grow up with at least a UNK UNK with the bible STOP 
START it draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation STOP 
START and it is easy for the ecumenical UNK to lose sight of how basic all this is STOP 
START but what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as christians in the world too often its conception of parish ministry and UNK care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind STOP 
START it is not stirring them to UNK the racial tensions of today with the mind of christ STOP 
START it is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy STOP 
START it is not making them sensitive to the UNK level of much of our economic and industrial life STOP 
START it is raising no disturbing question as to what christian UNK means for the relationship of the UNK nation in the world to economically UNK peoples STOP 
START it is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in asia and africa STOP 
START to put it UNK many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want STOP 
START it is not disturbing them by thoughts of their christian responsibility in relation to the world STOP 
START we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of christian witness and mission to the world STOP 
START there is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community STOP 
START he built a school and a library then a recreation center and an UNK STOP 
START UNK to fill the only remaining lack he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and UNK no expense in UNK it STOP 
START a visitor to the beautiful little building inquired do you belong to this church mr. rancher why no UNK he replied this church belongs to me story reflects the way too many people feel STOP 
START as long as the congregation UNK the church as our church or the minister thinks of it as my church just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance STOP 
START there must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to christ and that it is his purpose not our own interests and UNK that determines what it is to be and do STOP 
START local UNK of the whole a local church which UNK its function to be entirely that of UNK to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church STOP 
START it would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the church of christ STOP 
START yet the truth according to the new testament is that every local church has its existence only by being the UNK of the whole church in that particular place STOP

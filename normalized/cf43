START color was delayed until UNK the wide screen until the early fifties STOP 
START movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the UNK STOP 
START each film consisted of fifty feet which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen STOP 
START as long as audiences came to see the movement there seemed little reason to adventure further STOP 
START UNK UNK took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny UNK which can still be found in such urban areas as times square STOP 
START brief UNK of actual events were shown UNK dances street scenes STOP 
START the UNK and frightening enjoyed popularity a train UNK straight at the audience or a great wave UNK to break over the seats STOP 
START an early UNK production was the execution of mary queen of UNK STOP 
START the unfortunate queen mounted the UNK UNK swung his UNK head dropped off of film STOP 
START an early film by a UNK of the UNK of UNK park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage STOP 
START in the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the UNK UNK shows STOP 
START in response the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day STOP 
START despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous UNK art films and UNK despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as UNK the movies are at heart a form of fiction like the play the novel or the short story STOP 
START moreover the most UNK successful of the UNK films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature STOP 
START thus such great american UNK as the river and the plow that broke the plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures STOP 
START the discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men a french UNK UNK UNK and an american employee of UNK edwin s. porter STOP 
START of the two porter is UNK the better known for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward UNK a language of film toward making the motion picture the UNK efficient time machine that it has remained since even in the most UNK hands STOP 
START narrative time and film time UNK however out of his professional UNK as a UNK discovered and made use of a number of UNK techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film STOP 
START one of these is the UNK which makes possible a UNK smooth transition from scene to scene STOP 
START as the first scene begins to UNK the UNK scene begins to appear STOP 
START for a moment or two both scenes are present simultaneously one growing UNK one growing stronger STOP 
START in a series of UNK tales and UNK UNK demonstrated that the film is UNK equipped to tell a UNK story with beginning middle and end UNK UNK UNK and conclusions STOP 
START immediately the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own UNK connection with time STOP 
START physically a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one that has gone before even as it UNK the one now appearing STOP 
START UNK the smoothly changing images together the eye itself UNK them with the illusion of movement STOP 
START the UNK time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions STOP 
START so is the time of the novel STOP 
START the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time but the time is fixed by the director and the players the conductor and the UNK subject therefore to much variation as record UNK well know STOP 
START the time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely STOP 
START the film consists of a series of still transparent photographs or frames UNK STOP 
START each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen at the rate for silent movies of 16 frames per second and for sound films 24 frames per second STOP 
START this is the rate of UNK is also the rate of UNK STOP 
START time is built into the motion picture which cannot exist without time STOP 
START now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative which is at its UNK the story of an action with usually a beginning a middle and an end elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence STOP 
START the moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is to be sure more intense than a still picture of the same subject but the difference is really one of degree UNK element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still UNK STOP 
START in narrative time is essential as it is in film STOP 
START almost everything about the movies that is UNK of the movies UNK from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time STOP 
START this discovery of UNK was UNK more important than his sometimes UNK UNK UNK produced on film STOP 
START it was porter however who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since UNK STOP 
START the movie was the great train UNK and its effects on the young industry and art were all but UNK STOP 
START overnight for one thing UNK film UNK the standard running time of movies by ten STOP 
START the great train UNK is a UNK film STOP 
START one UNK from eight to twelve minutes became the standard length from the year of UNK UNK until griffith shattered that limit forever with birth of a nation in UNK STOP 
START the UNK itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies STOP 
START the material of the porter film is simplicity itself of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it good guys and bad guys in the old west pretty well dominated television toward the end of the UNK STOP 
START a band of UNK enters a railroad station UNK and ties up the telegraph operator holds up the train and UNK STOP 
START a posse is formed and UNK the UNK who having made their escape are UNK it up with some wild wild women in a UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK run from the UNK take cover in a UNK UNK and are shot dead by the posse STOP 
START as a UNK is UNK a UNK of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience STOP 
START all this is simple enough but in telling the story porter did two important things that had not been done before STOP 
START each scene is shot straight through as had been the universal custom from a camera fixed in a single position but in the outdoor scenes especially in the capture and destruction of the UNK UNK camera position breaks necessarily with the camera position standard until then which had been roughly that of a UNK in a center orchestra seat at a play STOP 
START the plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen STOP 
START if the change at first sight seems minor we may recall that it took the italian painters about two hundred years to make an UNK change and the italian painters by universal consent were the most brilliant group of UNK any art has seen STOP 
START in that apparently simple shift porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device STOP 
START he did more than that STOP 
START he revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic technique in the art of the film STOP 
START cutting of course takes place automatically in the creation of a film STOP 
START the meaning of the word is quite physical to begin with STOP 
START the physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence and the cut edge is joined physically by cement to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence STOP 
START if as a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable UNK of your child taking its first steps you have merely recorded an historical event STOP 
START if in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends you UNK the sequence to UNK in a few frames of the child's UNK watching this event you have begun to be an artist in film are UNK the basic technique of film are cutting STOP 
START this is what porter did STOP 
START as the UNK leave the UNK train the film suddenly cuts back to the station where the UNK little daughter UNK with her father's dinner UNK only to find him bound on the floor STOP 
START she UNK around in alarm STOP 
START the two events are taking place at the same time STOP 
START time and space have both become UNK STOP 
START we leap from event to event including the formation of the posse even though the events in reality are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously and not near each other but at a considerable distance STOP 
START the chase as a standard film device probably dates from the great train UNK and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device STOP 
START the chase in itself is a narrative UNK both speed and urgency and it demands cutting both from pursued to UNK and from stage to stage of the journey of both STOP 
START the simple naked idea of one man UNK another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction STOP 
START the cowboy films the cops and UNK films and the UNK comedy films UNK in an insane chase are not only UNK to what critics may assume to be a UNK taste for violence films and these UNK are also seeking out UNK or by design the UNK UNK elements of narrative STOP 
START the creator of the art of the film UNK griffith there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art STOP 
START the man was UNK griffith STOP 
START when he came to the movies more or less by accident they were still cheap entertainment capable of UNK the UNK for an idle few minutes STOP 
START in about seven years griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every UNK at the disposal of the film maker STOP 
START before he was forty griffith had created the art of the film STOP 
START not that there had not been attempts mostly european to do exactly that STOP 
START but in general the european efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK of famous novels and famous plays were presented STOP 
START great actors and UNK the most notable being sarah UNK were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera STOP 
START in all of this extensive and expensive effort the camera was UNK to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author STOP 
START the UNK today for all its high UNK and UNK sound is precisely what the early art UNK in the movies wished to make of the camera STOP 
START not surprisingly this approach did not work STOP 
START the effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names STOP 
START but no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies STOP

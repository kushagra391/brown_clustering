START marketing in the new decade will be no picnic for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last UNK UNK STOP 
START why of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and UNK in modern equipment and new processes UNK r d facilities faster new product development STOP 
START many companies have UNK their sales manpower and tested new selling distribution and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge STOP 
START given this kind of business climate what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 UNK on our experience with UNK we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups the market place itself marketing methods and marketing management STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START UNK in the market greater UNK STOP 
START there has been an UNK of UNK in recent years is every indication it will continue STOP 
START frequently UNK or UNK UNK has been UNK by manufacturers UNK and dealers STOP 
START despite generally good levels of income we see greater price pressures than ever before traveling back along the chain from consumer to UNK to manufacturer STOP 
START here are some key areas to examine to make sure your UNK strategy will be on target has the probable price situation in your field been UNK as a basis for future planning cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse you actually checked out not just mentally tested different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem customer UNK STOP 
START UNK consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims partly because of widespread criticism of such UNK STOP 
START this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses STOP 
START have you examined this problem of increasing consumer UNK from the standpoint of your own company demand for services STOP 
START UNK for service is here to stay and the problem is going to be UNK to solve in the sixties STOP 
START there are two reasons for this STOP 
START first most products tend to become more complex STOP 
START second in a competitive market the customer feels his weight and UNK it around STOP 
START providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product STOP 
START too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction STOP 
START good service starts with product design and planning many products seem to be designed for a production economy not for a service one STOP 
START proper UNK requires training your own sales organization and your UNK organizations not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations STOP 
START have you UNK the importance of service and given it proper attention UNK choices for customers STOP 
START -hlin spending his money today the consumer is pulled in many directions STOP 
START to the manufacturer of the more UNK product the purchase of which can be switched delayed or put off entirely the implications are important STOP 
START your competition is now UNK greater you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products STOP 
START many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or UNK the share of the UNK dollar being spent on their particular products STOP 
START has your company thought through its strategy in this whole UNK buying area shift of customers STOP 
START -hlthe trends have been in evidence for many years population shifts to the southwest and far west and from city to suburbs STOP 
START these shifts will continue in the next 10 UNK STOP 
START have you considered the implications of continuing UNK shifts in terms of sales force allocation strength of UNK organizations and even plant location concentration and distribution in fewer accounts STOP 
START UNK have already witnessed great changes through UNK and UNK in the food industry at both the manufacturing and retail ends STOP 
START instead of relatively small sales to many accounts there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts STOP 
START the change may require different products UNK UNK UNK UNK advertising and executive attention practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted STOP 
START have you examined these trends UNK the effects and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances STOP 
START UNK in marketing methods more private label competition STOP 
START -hlin the area of private label competition it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade STOP 
START as mass dealer and UNK organizations grow in size there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the UNK as well as the UNK profits which is in effect what the sale of private UNK tends to do STOP 
START average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business UNK largely the same qualities and styles in private brand UNK as in UNK STOP 
START moreover the larger and more aggressive mass distribution UNK and chain stores have insisted on high quality and the customer seems to have caught on STOP 
START if you are up against private brand competition have you formulated a long-term program for UNK and strengthening your market position private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear personal UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK backed by UNK through advertising and promotion will continue to make UNK in the sixties STOP 
START it has multiple implications and possible UNK for your marketing program STOP 
START how can you cash in on this UNK type of UNK and still maintain relationships with older existing UNK which are still important you have a UNK product how can you make it stand out justify its premium price without the spoken word is still necessary but it's a different brand of UNK STOP 
START have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products you studied the UNK and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing you UNK with different selling UNK in developing new customers costs of distribution generally STOP 
START UNK distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain UNK and UNK STOP 
START no manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved STOP 
START the use of bulk handling is continuously growing STOP 
START UNK are being used to keep branch inventories at more UNK levels STOP 
START selective selling UNK sales on the larger accounts has been used effectively by some manufacturers STOP 
START there may be possible UNK at any one of a number of UNK in your marketing and distribution chain STOP 
START do you have a program for UNK all these UNK regularly and carefully and with some imagination your sales force will a smaller number of UNK UNK salesmen serve you best or can you make out better with a larger number of UNK salesmen your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer UNK in return for some benefit they can share one company covering the country with a UNK sales force of 10 men the president personally UNK each major account every 6 UNK STOP 
START as a result distribution costs were cut customer relations improved STOP 
START distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job STOP 
START higher costs of advertising and promotion STOP 
START UNK the UNK point of view the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties STOP 
START it is UNK by the need for UNK goods and private label competition STOP 
START how much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program you following competition UNK trying to match dollar for dollar or are you UNK with new means for reaching and UNK UNK you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program from the standpoint of effort money and effectiveness UNK of new product development STOP 
START UNK all UNK mention new and exciting products on the horizon STOP 
START will you be out in the market place with some of these UNK new products competition UNK you to it this exciting new product era can have real UNK in store STOP 
START on the other hand the process of UNK an old product and UNK the new one is usually mighty expensive STOP 
START as markets become larger and marketing more complex the costs of an error become UNK larger STOP 
START is your r d or product development program UNK in to the commercial realities of the market there regular communications from the field or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with r d people knowledge is a wonderful thing but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register STOP 
START are there individuals in your organization who can UNK a new product through to UNK can develop reliable estimates of sales volume production and distribution costs translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance have seen good new products UNK because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans and management couldn't make up its mind STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK in marketing management shortage of skilled salesmen STOP 
START -hlthere is a shortage of salesmen today STOP 
START in the future UNK demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy and the UNK need will be greater still STOP 
START while many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel much of it has been product rather than sales training STOP 
START nor has the training been enough in relation to the need STOP 
START most marketing people agree it is going to take UNK efforts to satisfy future requirements STOP 
START have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future both UNK and UNK your company developed selection and training processes that are UNK to providing the UNK of salesmen you will need in the next 10 UNK of sales management talent STOP 
START UNK the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition sales management whether at the district region or headquarters level is a tough job today and it will be UNK in the future STOP 
START men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more UNK due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work STOP 
START the growth of business has UNK the available supply and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties STOP 
START does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep UNK marketing people of complete marketing planning STOP 
START UNK single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning STOP 
START UNK tactics are going to be harder to apply STOP 
START many food and UNK companies are already on a highly planned basis STOP 
START they have to be STOP 
START with greater UNK in plant facilities with UNK growing you can't switch around either in volume or in product design as much as was formerly possible or at least not as economically STOP 
START are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company find too many sales and marketing UNK so UNK with detail that they are UNK planning STOP 
START are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team you have a long-term UNK or UNK marketing program key to effective marketing is wrapped up in UNK your company's marketing problems UNK STOP 
START solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately UNK your problems whether they be in the market in marketing methods or in marketing management STOP 
START if companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they UNK then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade STOP

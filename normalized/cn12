START when several minutes had passed and curt hadn't emerged from the UNK stable UNK UNK the hotel and faced summers across the counter STOP 
START i have a little job for you charlie STOP 
START i'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor STOP 
START UNK voice was UNK but summers wasn't UNK STOP 
START he UNK his lips UNK STOP 
START what is it you want me to do mr. UNK shrugged UNK STOP 
START it's very simple STOP 
START i just want you to take a message to diane UNK STOP 
START tell her to come here to the hotel STOP 
START UNK relieved summers nodded and started toward the door STOP 
START one thing summers UNK said STOP 
START you're not to mention my name STOP 
START tell her curt adams wants to see her STOP 
START summers pulled up short and turned around STOP 
START i don't know mr. UNK he said UNK beginning to get an UNK of UNK plans STOP 
START it doesn't seem quite right telling her a thing like that STOP 
START couldn't i just his voice UNK off into silence STOP 
START UNK continued to smile but his eyes were cold STOP 
START he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed STOP 
START you know summers he said thoughtfully STOP 
START UNK nest ought to have a fire company STOP 
START if someone were to drop a match in here this place would go up like a UNK STOP 
START he started toward the UNK then turned to add tell her to come to UNK room that adams is in trouble STOP 
START tell her to hurry STOP 
START yes sir STOP 
START his face pale summers headed for the street STOP 
START UNK visit to the UNK stable had been merely a UNK in case anyone should be watching STOP 
START he paused only long enough to UNK that jess's UNK was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside STOP 
START the fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that UNK information had been wrong but curt didn't interpret it this way STOP 
START a man like jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed STOP 
START probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding STOP 
START from the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach UNK house without using the street STOP 
START curt approached the place UNK and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees STOP 
START there was a light in UNK front room but drawn UNK prevented any view of the interior STOP 
START curt UNK the house and located a barn out back STOP 
START he could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else STOP 
START there was no lock on the door only an iron UNK which he UNK STOP 
START he opened the door and went in pulling it shut behind him STOP 
START again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the UNK of a UNK UNK on a UNK floor STOP 
START he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden UNK STOP 
START horse smell was very strong and he could hear the UNK of grain being ground between strong UNK STOP 
START he found a match in his pocket and lit it STOP 
START there were two horses in the barn a UNK UNK and jess UNK UNK STOP 
START curt UNK out the match STOP 
START it was certain now that jess was in the house but also presumably was UNK black STOP 
START curt wanted to get jess alone without interference from anyone even as UNK a person as the store owner STOP 
START he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved STOP 
START reaching across the side of the stall he UNK the UNK on the UNK STOP 
START the startled animal let out a UNK UNK and UNK around in the stall STOP 
START as curt had hoped the house door UNK open STOP 
START he UNK the UNK again and it kicked wildly its UNK UNK the side of the stall STOP 
START curt moved over beside the door and waited STOP 
START presently he heard UNK crossing the yard and jess's UNK UNK STOP 
START the door swung open and jess said UNK what the UNK the matter with you the horse continued to UNK STOP 
START curt UNK that any animal belonging to jess would find much UNK in its UNK voice STOP 
START jess cursed again and entered the barn STOP 
START a match UNK and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop STOP 
START as he crossed to the side of the stall curt drew his gun and UNK back the UNK STOP 
START before you try anything he said STOP 
START remember what happened to UNK STOP 
START jess caught his breath in surprise STOP 
START he started to reach for his gun but apparently thought better of it STOP 
START that's the stuff curt said STOP 
START just hold it that way STOP 
START he reached out to pull the door shut and UNK it with a sliding UNK STOP 
START you and i have a little talking to do jess STOP 
START you won't be UNK this STOP 
START he moved up and lifted jess's pistol out of its UNK STOP 
START damn you adams jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock STOP 
START we ain't got nothing to talk about STOP 
START if i don't come back in the house UNK going to your UNK brother isn't in the house STOP 
START about now he's probably having supper STOP 
START that long ride the four of you took UNK given him a good appetite STOP 
START now turn around so i can see your face STOP 
START jess turned STOP 
START there was raw fury in his eyes and the UNK of his neck were swollen STOP 
START you're about as dumb as they come adams STOP 
START i don't know what you're up to but when UNK you can forget about UNK too curt said STOP 
START it's ben UNK we're going to talk about STOP 
START UNK UNK STOP 
START i don't know UNK about him STOP 
START no suppose you don't know anything about a piece of UNK either with blood all over it UNK blood STOP 
START UNK fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun STOP 
START so help me UNK i'd like to kill you where you stand but before i do i'm going to hear you admit killing him STOP 
START now start talking STOP 
START who told you to do it it dutch UNK was holding jess's gun in his left hand STOP 
START he drew back his arm to UNK the UNK across jess's face but didn't finish the motion STOP 
START UNK an UNK man might come easy to someone like jess but curt couldn't bring himself to do it STOP 
START apparently UNK this and realizing that it gave him an advantage jess became bold STOP 
START having all the guns makes you a big man don't it adams we was both armed you wouldn't talk so tough STOP 
START no reached out and dropped jess's pistol back into the UNK STOP 
START he UNK a step and UNK his own STOP 
START all right UNK on even terms STOP 
START now draw UNK out on jess's UNK face STOP 
START the fingers of his right hand twisted into a UNK but he didn't reach for the gun STOP 
START curt angry enough to be a little UNK raised his hands shoulder high STOP 
START does this make it any easier UNK i ain't UNK against you jess said UNK STOP 
START i heard how you UNK UNK STOP 
START i ain't a UNK STOP 
START no STOP 
START you're the kind of bastard who UNK up on a man from behind and hits him with a club STOP 
START i just wanted to hear you say so STOP 
START jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides STOP 
START he had found UNK weakness or what to jess was a weakness and was smart enough to take advantage of it STOP 
START somewhere in the distance a woman screamed STOP 
START curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention STOP 
START he had to make jess talk and he had to do it before UNK black got curious and came to investigate STOP 
START once more he lifted jess's gun from its UNK only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened UNK STOP 
START he dropped his own beside it STOP 
START we'll do it another way then he said UNK STOP 
START jess's UNK features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by UNK fist STOP 
START with a roar of pain and fury jess made his attack STOP 
START curt managed to UNK beneath the man's UNK fist and drove home a solid left to jess's UNK STOP 
START it was like hitting a UNK of salt STOP 
START pain shot up UNK arm clear to the shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit STOP 
START he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with a UNK right which sent him spinning STOP 
START an inch lower and it would have knocked him out STOP 
START as it was his vision UNK and for a moment he was unable to move STOP 
START when his eyes began to focus he saw jess UNK at him with a UNK STOP 
START curt twisted to one side and the UNK of the fork bit into the floor STOP 
START jess wasted a few seconds trying to UNK them loose STOP 
START it gave curt time to UNK to his feet STOP 
START the UNK broke off under jess's twisting and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock UNK brains out STOP 
START his aim was hurried the UNK UNK over UNK head STOP 
START by now curt was seeing clearly again STOP 
START he stepped inside jess's guard and landed two UNK to the big man's belly putting everything he had behind them STOP 
START they made jess double over STOP 
START when his head came down curt grabbed him by the hair and UNK him head first into the wall STOP 
START the building shook setting the lantern to UNK and the UNK to pitching again STOP 
START even UNK old UNK began to UNK and from the house black yelled jess going on out there didn't seem too sure himself STOP 
START he UNK UNK to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall STOP 
START curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor STOP 
START jess had had enough STOP 
START blood UNK from his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could UNK over his own feet in his frantic UNK to get away from UNK fists STOP 
START curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldn't quit STOP 
START he backed jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the man's UNK and drew back his right fist STOP 
START tell me about UNK killed him didn't you it was UNK idea jess UNK UNK at his nose STOP 
START he found out about you and UNK talking STOP 
START he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble STOP 
START you mean anyone who stood up for his rights curt said STOP 
START he let go of the shirt and jess UNK to the floor STOP 
START turning his back curt crossed to the stall reached over to UNK the UNK UNK rope and waved his hand in the UNK face STOP 
START the UNK UNK out of the stall STOP 
START curt moved in and picked up his gun STOP 
START he shook loose straw out of the action and placed the gun in his UNK STOP 
START leaving jess's where it lay he left the stall STOP 
START get up UNK STOP 
START we're going UNK STOP 
START jess painfully got to his feet as someone UNK the door STOP 
START who's in there called UNK STOP 
START curt opened the door grabbed black by the shoulder and pulled him into the barn STOP 
START you're staying right here for a while STOP 
START this dirty UNK just admitted killing UNK STOP 
START i'm going to let him tell it to somebody else STOP 
START he UNK black toward the stall and pointed his pistol at jess STOP 
START get out of here STOP 
START you're coming along UNK or i'll put a bullet in your leg STOP 
START jess stumbled through the door STOP 
START curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and UNK it STOP 
START black would have little trouble getting out but it might delay him a few minutes STOP 
START UNK you UNK me asked UNK STOP 
START we're going to marshal UNK house STOP 
START maybe if the marshal UNK this himself it'll make a difference STOP 
START somebody in this town must still have some UNK STOP

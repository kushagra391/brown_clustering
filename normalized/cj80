START a UNK platform system using restrained UNK is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the UNK combination STOP 
START the restrained UNK platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion UNK UNK effects as follows af where u is a UNK applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro STOP 
START the platform angle UNK is the angle about which the gyro is controlling STOP 
START this is normally termed the gyro input axis UNK away from the gyro output or UNK axis STOP 
START the gyro angular momentum is defined by h STOP 
START thus if the gyro and UNK combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the UNK axis the system can be UNK with an angular velocity af if a UNK is supplied to the gyro output axis aj STOP 
START it is assumed that the UNK are designed with electrical UNK so that a UNK can be applied about their output UNK STOP 
START in the system shown in fig. UNK the accelerometer output is UNK and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro UNK UNK STOP 
START this UNK causes the entire system to UNK about the UNK axis since the response to af STOP 
START if the UNK are correct the platform UNK in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero STOP 
START as the accelerometer output is UNK the UNK applied to the gyro output axis UNK and therefore the rate UNK STOP 
START finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system remains UNK and the platform is by definition leveled STOP 
START a mathematical block UNK for the leveling system is shown in fig. UNK STOP 
START the platform is initially off level by the angle aj STOP 
START the angle generated by the platform UNK UNK UNK by g is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer STOP 
START af is the scale factor of the accelerometer af STOP 
START the voltage af is UNK by af and applied to the gyro UNK with scale factor af STOP 
START finally the UNK platform characteristic is represented by af STOP 
START the system as indicated in fig. UNK is fundamental and simple because the UNK effects of both the platform UNK and the accelerometer have been neglected STOP 
START with these factors included an upper limit is placed on the UNK loop gain by stability considerations STOP 
START in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time STOP 
START when the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain STOP 
START the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately UNK proportional to the UNK loop gain STOP 
START in addition the UNK frequency for input UNK is approximately proportional to the UNK loop gain high loop gain causes the system to respond to UNK components of UNK STOP 
START this problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time STOP 
START it must be noticed in fig. UNK that the accelerometer UNK to any input acceleration STOP 
START the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is af STOP 
START in practice the UNK leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the UNK STOP 
START when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform angles respond to any UNK components of acceleration acting on the UNK STOP 
START there are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind UNK engine noise UNK around the vehicle etc. STOP 
START one of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of UNK acceleration noise STOP 
START one solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include UNK UNK STOP 
START this technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform UNK STOP 
START since a lower loop gain and UNK UNK increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached STOP 
START one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a UNK UNK for af STOP 
START the UNK is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level STOP 
START below this level the UNK gain af is proportional and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise UNK STOP 
START the effect is that the platform returns from an UNK position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional UNK with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process STOP 
START when the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is UNK by the output of the leveling system UNK af STOP 
START the platform actually UNK off level so that the accelerometer output when UNK by af will supply the correct current to the gyro UNK to UNK the gyro drift STOP 
START the amount of platform UNK required depends upon the scale factors of the system STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START practical leveling considerations STOP 
START -hlthe automatic leveling system described in this section is readily UNK to a UNK platform consisting of three UNK UNK STOP 
START the system requires some UNK of flight equipment UNK STOP 
START however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled UNK with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform STOP 
START this leveling system will hold the platform UNK automatically as long as the system is UNK STOP 
START a useful UNK of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift UNK is available from the UNK necessary to hold the system in level STOP 
START the leveling process can be accomplished UNK and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment STOP 
START the process consists in turning the platform UNK until the UNK of both UNK are zero STOP 
START the turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro UNK described above STOP 
START in brief the human UNK UNK af in figs. UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer UNK STOP 
START if high accuracy is required in UNK leveling it is usually necessary to UNK or UNK UNK the accelerometer UNK this also UNK the noise problem STOP 
START with integration the effect of a small acceleration or small platform UNK angle can be seen after a time STOP 
START however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy STOP 
START also it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach STOP 
START UNK leveling is UNK if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time STOP 
START the operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro UNK so that the effect of gyro drift is UNK STOP 
START this process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK heading STOP 
START platform heading consists of UNK the sensitive axis of the UNK parallel to the desired UNK system of the UNK STOP 
START in simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction STOP 
START for purely UNK UNK two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading use of external or UNK equipment to establish proper heading of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading STOP 
START the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish the heading STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START external determination of heading UNK technique STOP 
START UNK the UNK platform leveled it can be headed in the proper direction by using UNK techniques STOP 
START the platform UNK must be slightly modified for this procedure STOP 
START before the UNK are mounted on the platform the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined STOP 
START a mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is UNK to the sensitive axis of the unit STOP 
START transit STOP 
START -hla precision transit is set up so that it is UNK with respect to true north STOP 
START this can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing UNK techniques STOP 
START with the transit set up a mirror on one of the UNK is UNK and the platform is turned until it is UNK STOP 
START the UNK procedure includes the use of a UNK for the transit to project a beam of light which is UNK by crossed hairs on the accelerometer mirror STOP 
START when the platform is UNK the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly UNK upon the original crossed hairs STOP 
START the images can easily be UNK with a high degree of accuracy STOP 
START the platform is turned as required by supplying UNK to the appropriate gyro UNK STOP 
START although this technique is simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist the direction of true north must be known for each UNK point STOP 
START however this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a UNK team can establish a true north base line with a few UNK work STOP 
START in many installations the UNK platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight STOP 
START with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with UNK equipment STOP 
START if the platform is not too high off the ground a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform STOP 
START obviously the heading accuracy is UNK by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START -hlthe transit can be replaced by an UNK STOP 
START this instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular UNK of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading STOP 
START the electrical signal from the UNK is UNK and supplied to the UNK UNK STOP 
START if the UNK is correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero STOP 
START information is also available from this UNK system to set the drift UNK for the UNK gyro STOP 
START if the UNK gyro is drifting a current generated by the UNK is delivered to the gyro UNK to UNK the drift STOP 
START if the drift error is systematic it can be UNK with a UNK circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required UNK current STOP 
START electrical UNK STOP 
START -hlit is possible to locate an angular electrical UNK which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform STOP 
START essentially the UNK or reference portion of the UNK is established with respect to the true heading direction and the platform is turned either UNK or automatically until the angular electrical UNK signal is reduced to zero STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK heading STOP 
START UNK UNK is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading STOP 
START for the case of a purely UNK UNK consisting of three restrained UNK a UNK system is used where the sensitive axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the UNK direction at the base point and the UNK accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the UNK direction at the base point STOP 
START the UNK are mounted UNK on the platform STOP 
START thus if one accelerometer is properly UNK the other is also STOP 
START the input axis of the appropriate UNK are parallel to the sensitive direction of the UNK STOP 
START figure UNK shows a platform system with the gyro UNK arranged as described above STOP 
START the platform is leveled and properly headed so that the UNK input axis is parallel to the UNK direction and the UNK input axis is parallel to the UNK direction STOP 
START the input axis of the x gyro when pointing in the UNK direction is always UNK to the UNK axis of earth STOP 
START if the platform is not properly headed the UNK input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation STOP 
START the UNK of this rotation by the x gyro can be UNK to direct the platform into proper heading STOP 
START in fig. UNK the input axis of the UNK platform is shown at some point on the earth STOP 
START the point is at a UNK UNK and the platform is at an error in heading east STOP 
START the earth is spinning at an angular velocity UNK equal to one revolution per 24 UNK STOP 
START when the platform is level UNK is a rotation about the UNK axis of the platform af STOP 
START since the earth is rotating and the UNK UNK platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating with respect to the earth STOP

START the deep water is used by many people but it is always clean for the washing is done outside STOP 
START i know now why our japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom STOP 
START of course most UNK are eastern style at floor level but even when they are raised to chair height they are actually outside UNK inside STOP 
START a few newer homes have western flush UNK but even with running water they are usually eastern style STOP

START they are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning STOP 
START the library has open UNK even in the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START spiritual life is UNK but students do not need to be christian STOP 
START they have an UNK record of being able to place in employment UNK of their graduates STOP

START mrs. UNK is one of the japanese women one reads about beautiful UNK UNK an UNK manager of her big household four boys and four girls and yet looking like a UNK gentle japanese woman STOP 
START she was a real experience dances were as beautiful as anything i have ever seen they rival the new york UNK for scenery and precision as well as imagination STOP 
START because don was leaving the next day i spent the evening with him at asia center STOP 
START the following morning mr. UNK called for me and we went to visit schools UNK UNK elementary school and high school mr. UNK school STOP 
START there is much more freedom in the schools here than i expected some think too much STOP 
START there is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools STOP 
START with the loss of the emperor UNK in japan the people are left in confusion with no god or moral UNK that have strength STOP 
START the older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles but the younger people who have lost all faith and convictions are now parents STOP 
START there seems to be no purpose in life that is sure no certain UNK principles to give stability STOP 
START as a result money is spent quickly and freely with no thought of its value STOP 
START gambling is everywhere especially among students STOP 
START parents UNK their children STOP 
START the government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to UNK some moral education for the schools but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused STOP 
START i was told that it is quite likely that japanese soldiers would not fight again for why should they will be painful but interesting to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop STOP

START UNK after a day at UNK mrs. UNK put me on the train for UNK STOP 
START my instructions were that mr. UNK would meet me at the hotel but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome STOP 
START my hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by UNK and the japan travel bureau and were more elegant than i would have chosen but it was fun for once to be elegant i did explain to the students however that this was not my usual style for their UNK are very small and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well STOP 
START they understood and UNK me a bit about it STOP 
START i think i would have been much disappointed in japan if i had not seen UNK UNK and hiroshima STOP 
START UNK is the ancient capital of japan and still its cultural center STOP 
START it along with UNK was UNK by the war and is now a beautiful example of the UNK of UNK japan STOP 
START here i was accompanied by mrs. UNK UNK mother her son mr. UNK a prospective student with whom i have been corresponding for more than a year and mr. UNK one of the science teachers STOP

START i was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school STOP 
START they UNK for the condition including dirt and flies and i was a little at a loss to know what to say STOP 
START there seemed to be no excuse don't have the answer yet STOP 
START we had tea at mr. UNK home where i learned that he too comes from a very wealthy family STOP 
START his grandfather is a UNK priest he being the UNK was supposed to be a priest but he chose to do differently and one of his brothers is to become the priest STOP 
START this is a significant fact in japan for only a few years ago he would have had no choice STOP 
START in his big home live four families and thirty people so it needs to be big STOP 
START also there are housed here some UNK historical UNK from 400 to UNK years old paintings UNK UNK etc. STOP 
START he had displayed more of them than usual so that i could enjoy them STOP 
START about 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum STOP 
START the house itself is 400 years old with all the UNK of older UNK times STOP 
START UNK UNK and hiroshima mr. UNK went with me on the train to UNK STOP 
START we passed his house and school on the way STOP 
START in UNK i stayed at the hotel where the prince and UNK had stayed on their honeymoon STOP 
START a new red carpet had been laid for their coming but i walked on it too STOP 
START here mr. UNK met us after a UNK train trip from the town where he teaches STOP 
START even though we had walked miles in UNK that day we started out again to see UNK at night STOP 
START in the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to UNK to put me on the train for hiroshima STOP 
START again the plan was for me to go alone but they wouldn't let me STOP 
START at UNK mr. UNK had to leave us to get the train to his home but mr. UNK and i had an hour and a half before train time to see UNK at night STOP 
START it is the second largest city in japan with about four million people STOP 
START one spot in UNK i shall always remember the bridge where we stood to watch the UNK of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river STOP 
START in the midst of a great busy city people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light STOP 
START my train arrived in hiroshima at the awful hour of UNK a.m. STOP 
START i had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little after which mr. UNK would arrive and pilot me around STOP 
START but there he was at the train with an oregon state UNK in his hand STOP 
START i know now why the students insisted that i go to hiroshima even when i told them i didn't want to STOP 
START they knew that i was still UNK over the tragic event and they felt that if i could see the recovery and the spirit of the people who hold no UNK but who also UNK UNK harbor i would be happier and would understand better a new japan STOP 
START there were no words to say this but there was no need STOP 
START the teachers of mr. UNK school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming STOP 
START hiroshima is a better city than it was before in the minds of the people i met was a strong determination for peace and understanding STOP 
START i was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience STOP 
START a better world may yet come out of hiroshima STOP 
START tokyo on arriving in tokyo later we were met by UNK who took us immediately to her university the japanese women's university STOP 
START this day was open house for parents day and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables STOP 
START everything was in an exciting turmoil full of anticipation and fun STOP 
START it was UNK to see the effect of an UNK teacher on japanese students in a class in home planning STOP 
START our UNK is one of the very few UNK in japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs STOP 
START i am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work and even now it is important to have UNK for the use of servants STOP 
START many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in american homes but an interesting UNK of cultures finds us using japanese UNK in our own western architecture at the same time that the japanese are adopting western utility patterns STOP 
START at this women's university we find a monument to a UNK family who believed that japanese women also should be educated STOP 
START even today there are some doubts about the value of education for japanese women but this university continues to grow and to send its students out into the community STOP 
START active UNK have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social UNK and professional meetings STOP 
START as far as i am concerned there is continuous UNK up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women UNK to break traditions STOP 
START UNK is also teaching in a UNK school for japanese UNK in tokyo STOP 
START here the women learn to keep house as maids become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests STOP 
START they learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family STOP 
START they have model UNK a sick room with a model patient in bed and a nursery with a UNK UNK STOP 
START although the training is only for one month it is intensive and thorough STOP 
START graduates of this UNK school are much in demand and can always find work immediately STOP 
START occasionally they return for additional training STOP 
START UNK home economics training comes into play as she designs UNK along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials STOP 
START UNK also uses the training she got in an american home where she learned to polish furniture clean corners and work effectively in keeping a UNK house STOP 
START her education in the united states not just in a classroom but also in an american house with an american UNK stands her in good UNK STOP 
START university of tokyo after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria the kitchen of which UNK had planned mr. UNK and i left to meet representatives of the UNK for a visit to the university of tokyo STOP

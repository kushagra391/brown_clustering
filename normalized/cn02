START gavin paused UNK STOP 
START you can't stay here with me STOP 
START it's late and you said they'd be here by dawn STOP 
START you can't make me go STOP 
START gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock STOP 
START he was thinking of UNK and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the UNK STOP 
START it was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt STOP 
START beneath his black shirt his UNK shoulders shook and UNK of pain broke from his throat the stored pain UNK free in slow UNK terrible to see STOP 
START clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known STOP

START the eyes followed him UNK STOP 
START the horses STOP 
START there isn't much time STOP 
START i'll saddle the horses and bring them round STOP 
START you get ready he burst from the hot UNK of the room into the cold night air STOP 
START UNK UNK was in the barn and he UNK the UNK over the saddle blanket working by touch in the darkness UNK the animal with easy words STOP 
START when he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch STOP 
START the UNK had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to UNK the UNK shaking his head STOP 
START clayton UNK the UNK in a UNK over the UNK post and UNK the warm flesh of his neck STOP 
START the mare had backed away STOP 
START you take it easy boy clayton whispered STOP 
START she doesn't want you now STOP 
START you take it easy your time will come STOP 
START gavin stood on the porch a thin figure STOP 
START he had taken a UNK down from the wall and it UNK from his hand the stock UNK on the wood floor STOP 
START clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps STOP 
START clay he said where are we UNK to a ranch in the valley STOP

START clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like a child STOP 
START i hate to leave my garden gavin said STOP

START lived alone here for three years before any man came STOP 
START lived alone by the river STOP 
START it was nice then so peaceful and quiet STOP 
START there was no one but me STOP 
START i don't want to leave it STOP 
START clayton swung into the saddle and UNK the UNK UNK STOP 
START the two horses broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house into the darkness STOP 
START thirty-five they rode at a measured pace through the valley STOP 
START dawn would come soon and the night was at its UNK STOP 
START the moon had UNK below the black crest of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light looked UNK as if no man had ever UNK before STOP 
START it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago on those nights when he slept alone by his UNK and UNK suddenly to the UNK of an UNK or the UNK of a blade of grass in the UNK wind a savage land UNK and brooding too strong to be broken by the will of men STOP 
START gavin sighed bitterly STOP 
START in that UNK landscape the UNK of his desires passed before his mind STOP 
START he saw them UNK UNK in the UNK of the broken and the dying STOP 
START in UNK his mind UNK to UNK the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately but they would not come to life STOP 
START the silence UNK him made him bend low over the UNK neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search STOP 
START they passed UNK that were framed dark gray against the black hills STOP 
START then at last the darkness began to UNK STOP 
START a bold line of UNK broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky STOP 
START the UNK light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first UNK the contours of trees and fences and UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though UNK eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the UNK shelter of the trees STOP 
START the two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence STOP 
START the men in UNK were tired from a night's drinking their faces red and UNK STOP 
START but the liquor had UNK their courage STOP 
START they greeted the news UNK as though they had been UNK of purpose STOP 
START lester heard their UNK saw their eyes reveal their desire STOP 
START he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked STOP 
START he's UNK STOP 
START that's what you wanted isn't it is with him UNK him out of the valley STOP 
START you can't keep out of this UNK UNK STOP 
START he's not your brother he's UNK son STOP 
START you see he UNK to us when he said he was UNK alone STOP 
START joe UNK was thinking back many years STOP 
START first he thought of the time he had UNK to gavin and told him how his cattle were being UNK at the far end of the valley STOP 
START he remembered UNK UNK his own UNK feeling his UNK STOP 
START then he thought of a time when UNK horse had fallen UNK in the gap STOP 
START his wife had said to him UNK is in love with clayton roy STOP 
START he wouldn't even dance with her at UNK party STOP 
START he treats her like she was dirt STOP 
START and you stand by like a fool and let him do it he remembered UNK UNK smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water STOP 
START it was the night clayton had UNK them in the UNK game STOP 
START you're UNK son joe UNK had said STOP 
START he turned to lester STOP 
START you brought him back to this valley UNK he would help you find your boy STOP 
START he meant to help gavin all the time STOP 
START he made a fool of you lester STOP 
START he swung round to the other men we can catch him easy are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place STOP 
START if we let them go they won't stay away they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back STOP 
START there's only one way they can get out now and that's through the gap if we ride hard we can take them STOP 
START UNK hand UNK to UNK shoulder STOP 
START the boy jerked away STOP 
START he killed tom do you understand that turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do wild to break from the UNK warmth of the saloon into the cold of the UNK night STOP 
START he fled through the door and down the steps running and the men UNK and followed pushing lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light STOP 
START UNK and UNK UNK were the last to leave STOP 
START they mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance STOP 
START UNK in the cold dawn the mist UNK low to the ground then rose with a UNK of sudden wind to leave the valley clear STOP 
START the clouds UNK and hard UNK of sunlight UNK down to UNK the earth with UNK of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses UNK like dark streams over the UNK snow STOP 
START when they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them UNK out on the prairie in a flat black line STOP 
START the wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were UNK and their UNK UNK like stiff black UNK in the wind STOP 
START the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START he looked over his shoulder at the thin UNK of UNK STOP 
START they neither gained nor fell back STOP 
START he rode low on the UNK neck STOP 
START ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the gap no more than a mile away STOP 
START UNK face was UNK with excitement STOP 
START he did not look back could feel more than hear the UNK beat of UNK that UNK out across the prairie to the north STOP 
START he knew who was riding after him the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him UNK their loyalty to him STOP 
START now they were riding to kill him STOP 
START and he was UNK running UNK his death and his life at the same time STOP 
START the land over which he UNK was the land he had created and lived in his valley STOP 
START with every UNK stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never see again STOP 
START the gap UNK before him the place where had confronted jack english on that day so many years ago was his UNK from all that had meaning to him STOP 
START california is too far he thought STOP 
START he would never reach california STOP 
START he was too old when he passed up and through the corridor of UNK that lined the trail he could see ahead he was passing from life STOP

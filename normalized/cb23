START everywhere i went in UNK i asked the same question STOP 
START i was searching for an UNK of UNK or even of UNK STOP 
START i never found it among any of the chinese with whom i spoke though granted they were almost all members of the official family who presumably harbor official thoughts STOP 
START but i questioned also professional soldiers who would not easily be UNK by a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START their answer was it can be done and we will do it STOP 
START and then i put the question as UNK as i could directly to UNK UNK in america i said practically no one believes that you UNK intend to UNK the mainland STOP 
START what evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government UNK to do just that and that it can be done smiled STOP 
START he always smiles at least at visitors i gather STOP 
START he smiled also at a british UNK seated next to me who asked the most UNK questions STOP 
START i recalled UNK the UNK complaint in UNK my last UNK STOP 
START he smiled and said a word or two to the UNK who turned to me the president UNK where you are going after you leave UNK i UNK is a royal UNK if ever there was one STOP 
START i answered the routine question about my UNK rather UNK STOP 
START UNK spoke again this time at greater length STOP 
START the president says the UNK came in that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in southeast asia and that everywhere you went you would seek the answer to your question STOP 
START he says that if he were to express to you once again his own profound determination to go to the mainland and his faith that that return is feasible he would merely sound UNK STOP 
START so you yourself must seek these objective data and come to your own conclusions STOP 
START any information we have here in UNK is at your disposal STOP 
START fair enough STOP 
START what are the relevant data every person on UNK there are sixty in mainland china STOP 
START if the raw population figures are UNK relevant then it is idle to think of UNK as idle as to suppose that poland might UNK russia STOP 
START relative military manpower than UNK but at least UNK STOP 
START the estimates vary widely on the strength of the chinese army STOP 
START say four million STOP 
START the armed forces of UNK are at a working strength of about UNK though a reserve potential twice that high is UNK STOP 
START skill is generally conceded that the UNK air force is the best by far in asia and the army the best trained STOP 
START the morale is very high STOP 
START even so it UNK up to impossible odds except that the question arises on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight miserable people of china the largest cast ever UNK to UNK an ideological passion play cannot themselves resist UNK STOP 
START they think UNK of physical survival everything else is secondary STOP 
START but the army which UNK continues to feed well where are its UNK psychological UNK in UNK stress the great sense of family UNK in china over thousands of years STOP 
START it has not been UNK by ten years of communist UNK STOP 
START every soldier in the army has somewhere relatives who are close to UNK STOP 
START the soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion it is assumed but will their UNK spread to the officer class immediate families of the UNK and the UNK are well fed a UNK does not UNK on his UNK STOP 
START but there are the UNK and UNK and UNK STOP 
START their UNK are almost beyond endurance STOP 
START in behalf of what as understood by UNK UNK STOP 
START to whom will the UNK stay loyal is little doubt if they had a secret ballot they would vote for food for their family in place of ideological purity out on the farm STOP 
START it is another question whether they or a single general off in a corner of china secure for a few UNK days at least from instant UNK will UNK the party STOP 
START but the disposition to rebel is most definitely there STOP 
START but there must be a UNK pressure STOP 
START the military in UNK believe that the communists have made two mistakes which together may prove fatal STOP 
START the first was the UNK program which will UNK agricultural poverty for years STOP 
START the family is largely broken up where it is not it is left with no UNK and the social meaning of this is enormous STOP 
START for it is the family that in china has always provided social security for the UNK the sick the UNK members of the UNK STOP 
START now the government must do that the government is left with no reserve UNK under the agricultural system it has UNK STOP 
START thus the government simultaneously UNK the vast burden of social security which had UNK been privately UNK and created a national UNK which has UNK UNK problems of social security STOP 
START the second mistake is UNK STOP 
START UNK has historically served china as a buffer state STOP 
START a friendly state sometimes only UNK but never hostile STOP 
START china never tried to UNK UNK by UNK the people's religion and institutions STOP 
START red china is trying to do this and she is not likely ever to succeed STOP 
START UNK is too vast the UNK is too difficult STOP 
START UNK may UNK china as UNK is bleeding france STOP 
START these continuing pressures social economic and military are doing much to keep china in a UNK state of tension STOP 
START the UNK of yet another pressure a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap STOP 
START the planners in UNK struck me as realistic men STOP 
START they know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control STOP 
START first and foremost they depend on the UNK UNK of the communist regime STOP 
START on these they feel they can rely STOP 
START UNK they depend on america's moral cooperation when the crucial moment UNK STOP 
START they hope that if history UNK the west another UNK we will receive the opportunity UNK STOP 
START i remarked UNK to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a UNK of selected american liberals to UNK on an odd day STOP 
START he affected most properly not to understand my point STOP 
START but he and all of china UNK the UNK of american UNK and he knows what an uncertain UNK we are STOP 
START we have been grand to UNK itself lots of aid and most of the time a policy of support for the UNK islands STOP 
START but our outlook has been and continues to be defensive STOP 
START a great deal depends on the UNK of mr. kennedy's views on the world struggle STOP 
START the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland is in flux and are poised to strike STOP 
START there is not anywhere on the UNK of freedom a more highly UNK force for UNK STOP 
START the moment of truth is the moment of crisis STOP 
START during the slow UNK the essence of a policy or a man is UNK under UNK details fine words UNK UNK STOP 
START the crisis burns these suddenly away STOP 
START there the truth is open to eyes that are willing to look STOP 
START the moment passes STOP 
START new UNK UNK are UNK tossed on the UNK bones STOP 
START a UNK crisis UNK in katanga for a couple of days this month to be quickly UNK by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such UNK STOP 
START before memory too clouds over let us make a note or two of what could be seen STOP 
START the measure was instantly taken as always in such cases of public men at many levels STOP 
START one knows better now who has bone and who has UNK in his UNK STOP 
START but i am here concerned more with policy than with men STOP 
START public men come and go but great issues of policy remain STOP 
START now everyone knows or knew in the week of december 10 that something had gone UNK wrong with american foreign policy STOP 
START the united states was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-western and UNK within any of the new nations the only place in africa moreover where a productive relationship between whites and UNK had apparently been achieved STOP 
START of course the fighting was officially under the UNK of the united nations STOP 
START but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the u.s. was in reality the principal STOP 
START the moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our nato allies to the entire western community STOP 
START by our policy the west was is split STOP 
START but the key revelation is not new STOP 
START the controlling pattern was first displayed in the UNK crisis of november 1956 STOP 
START it UNK in whole or part whenever a new crisis UNK the reality in cuba last spring with which the dominican events of last month should be UNK the UNK of the nuclear test and the berlin UNK relation to laos UNK south africa now with almost UNK emphasis in the UNK linked complex of UNK STOP 
START what the moments reveal this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows under prevailing policy the u.s. can take the initiative against the right but cannot take the initiative against the left STOP 
START it makes no difference what part of the world is involved what form of regime what particular issue STOP 
START the u.s. cannot take the initiative against the left STOP 
START there is even some question whether the u.s. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the left STOP 
START we can attack UNK but not UNK STOP 
START no matter that UNK is UNK man in the congo STOP 
START no matter that it is his troops who UNK western women and eat western men STOP 
START no matter that the katanga operation is UNK insane in terms of western interests in africa STOP 
START even granted that the congo should be unified you don't protect western security by first UNK the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium STOP 
START we can force britain and france out of the UNK but we cannot so much as try to force the russian tanks back from UNK STOP 
START we can mass our fleet against the UNK but not against the UNK STOP 
START we can vote in the un against south african UNK or UNK rule in UNK but we cannot even introduce a motion on the berlin wall much less give the simple order to push the wall down STOP 
START we officially receive the UNK UNK UNK UNK but we UNK the UNK UNK UNK as criminal STOP 
START in the very week of our war against katanga we make a UNK million grant to UNK UNK who has just declared his solidarity with the communist UNK and is UNK turning his own country into a UNK dictatorship STOP 
START as our planes land the war UNK that UNK pro-western UNK we stand UNK UNK while UNK troops UNK into a UNK district of our nato UNK UNK STOP 
START what explains this UNK UNK is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international and in some degree our domestic policy STOP 
START the UNK crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new administration but only made more consistent and more active STOP 
START key to the UNK most immediately relevant to these UNK in UNK katanga and UNK as to the UNK crisis before them is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the UNK region of asia africa and latin america STOP 
START from this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the UNK UNK UNK nations especially on those whose leaders make the most noise UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK etc. STOP 
START our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in UNK eyes STOP 
START if we grasp this orientation as a key our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible STOP 
START and it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the left STOP

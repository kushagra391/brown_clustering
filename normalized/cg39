START the film they did after his return was an UNK bit of nothing titled out of this world a UNK on the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the twist lay in using UNK UNK voice on the sound track while leading man eddie UNK UNK the words STOP 
START if nothing else at least two good songs came out of the project out of this world and june comes around every year STOP 
START though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs arlen and mercer were not given strong material to work on STOP 
START their first collaboration came close STOP 
START early in 1941 they were assigned to a script titled hot UNK STOP 
START it UNK to be a reasonably serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians their aims their problems the UNK between the pure and the commercial and seemed a promising vehicle for the two men shared a common interest in jazz STOP 
START johnny mercer practically grew up with the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears STOP 
START he was born in UNK georgia in UNK STOP 
START his father george a. mercer was UNK from an honored southern family that could trace its UNK back to one UNK mercer who had UNK from scotland in UNK STOP

START the UNK caused his family to assign a full-time maid to keeping an eye on the boy STOP 
START but one afternoon mrs. mercer met her were obviously on the way to the mercer home STOP 
START the mother inquired UNK johnny and why did you leave him there was nothing else i could do the maid answered satisfied with a rather vague explanation STOP 
START but mrs. mercer demanded more STOP 
START the maid then told her because he fired me STOP 
START with her son UNK so strong a musical bent his mother could do little else but get him started on the study of music though she waited until he was ten beginning with the piano and following that with the UNK STOP 
START young mercer showed a remarkable lack of UNK for both instruments STOP 
START still he did like music making and even sang in the chapel UNK of the UNK forest school near orange virginia where he sounded fine but did not UNK too well STOP 
START when he was fifteen john h. mercer turned out his first song a UNK little thing he called sister UNK UNK your stuff STOP 
START if his scholarship and formal UNK were not all they might have been mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with a remarkable ear for rhythm and UNK STOP 
START from his UNK in UNK mercer had picked up along with a soft southern UNK UNK also of the UNK UNK of africa STOP 
START such speech differences made him UNK aware of the UNK and UNK of language STOP 
START during the summers while he was still in school mercer worked for his father's firm as a UNK boy STOP 
START it generally took well into the autumn for the firm to recover from the UNK help STOP 
START we'd give him things to deliver letters checks UNK and things like that remembers his UNK walter still in the real estate business in UNK and learn days later that he'd UNK UNK them into his pocket STOP 
START there they stayed STOP 
START this rather detached attitude toward UNK UNK has seemed to be the dominant UNK in UNK personality ever since STOP 
START it is however a UNK UNK or perhaps a UNK for not only has mercer proved himself to be one of the few great UNK over the years but also one who can function remarkably under pressure STOP 
START he has also enjoyed a successful career as an UNK his records have sold in the millions and is a sharp UNK STOP 
START he has also an extraordinary conscience STOP 
START in 1927 his father's business collapsed and rather than go UNK mercer senior turned his firm over to a bank for liquidation STOP 
START he died before he could completely pay off his debts STOP 
START some years later the bank handling the mercer liquidation received a check for UNK enough to clear up the debt STOP 
START the check had been mailed from chicago the envelope bore no return address and the check was not signed STOP 
START that's johnny sighed the bank president the UNK boy in the world but UNK STOP 
START but UNK explanation was simple i made out the check and carried it around a few days UNK in case i lost it STOP 
START when he remembered that he might have not signed the check mercer made out another for the same amount UNK the bank to destroy the other especially if he had happened to have UNK signed both of them STOP 
START when the family business failed mercer left school and on his mother's UNK for she hoped that he would become an actor he joined a local little theater group STOP

START he had talked one other member of the group to stay with him but that friend had tired of not eating regularly and returned to UNK STOP 
START but mercer hung on living after a fashion in a greenwich village UNK UNK STOP 
START the place had no sink or UNK only a UNK his mother discovered when she visited him STOP 
START johnny insisted on cooking a chicken dinner in my honor he's always been a good cook and i'll never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub STOP 
START a story no doubt UNK for mercer himself UNK it has him UNK a UNK in those village days STOP 
START though merely clear glass it was a distinctive trade mark for an UNK actor who hoped to UNK himself upon the memories of producers STOP 
START one day in a bar so the legend goes someone put a beer stein with too much force on the UNK and broke it STOP 
START the innocent UNK filled with that supreme sense of honor found in bars insisted upon UNK the destroyed UNK and did over the protests of the former owner with a square UNK STOP 
START mercer is supposed to have refused it with anyone who UNK a square UNK must be affected miller then assistant director for the UNK UNK a theatre UNK production needed a UNK for a song he had written just happened not to need any actor at the moment however STOP 
START for him mercer produced the lyric to out of breath scared to death of you introduced in that most successful of all the UNK by UNK UNK STOP 
START this 1930 edition also had songs in it by vernon duke and UNK UNK by e. UNK UNK and duke and by harry UNK STOP 
START entrance into such UNK song writing company encouraged the UNK song writer to take a wife elizabeth UNK a dancer in the UNK STOP 
START the UNK took up residence in brooklyn and mercer found a regular job in wall street UNK stocks and bonds STOP 
START when he heard that paul UNK was looking for singers to replace the rhythm boys mercer applied and got the job not for my voice i'm sure but because i could write songs and material generally STOP 
START while with the UNK band mercer met jerry arlen STOP 
START he had yet to meet harold arlen for although they had UNK on UNK UNK UNK mercer and UNK had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them STOP 
START the lyric mercer remembers was UNK to fit the unusual melody STOP 
START UNK UNK association brought him into contact with UNK UNK whose UNK mercer UNK as UNK in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning of UNK UNK career STOP 
START after leaving UNK mercer joined the UNK UNK band as a UNK STOP 
START with the help of UNK UNK also in the band he transformed a traditional jewish melody into a popular song and the angels sing STOP 
START the UNK success of UNK and and the angels sing could only lead to hollywood where besides harold arlen mercer UNK with harry warren UNK van UNK richard UNK walter UNK UNK UNK and arthur UNK STOP 
START mercer has also written both music and lyrics for several songs STOP 
START he may be the only song writer ever to have UNK with a secretary of the u. s. treasury UNK on a song with william UNK UNK who was secretary of the treasury UNK STOP 
START when johnny mercer and harold arlen began their collaboration in 1940 mercer like arlen had several substantial film songs to his credit among them UNK for hollywood ride UNK ride have you got any UNK baby and too marvelous for words all with richard UNK harry warren he did the girl friend of the UNK UNK UNK UNK and you must have been a beautiful baby STOP 
START UNK lyrics are characterized by an UNK ear for rhythmic UNK a UNK sense of humor expressed in language with a UNK UNK STOP 
START though UNK and capable of turning out a UNK lyric with the best of them UNK UNK is a highly polished UNK wit STOP 
START his casual UNK working methods often as not in UNK were an abrupt change from UNK so that arlen had to adjust again to another approach to collaboration STOP 
START there were times that he worked with both UNK simultaneously STOP 
START speaking of his work with johnny mercer arlen says our working habits were strange STOP 
START after we got a script and the spots for the songs were blocked out we'd get together for an hour or so every day STOP 
START while johnny made himself comfortable on the couch i'd play the UNK for him STOP 
START he has a wonderfully UNK memory STOP 
START after i would finish playing the songs he'd just go away without a comment STOP 
START i wouldn't hear from him for a couple of weeks then he'd come around with the completed lyric STOP 
START arlen is one of the few possibly the only composer mercer has been able to work with so closely for they held their meetings in UNK study STOP 
START some guys bothered me mercer has said STOP 
START i couldn't write with them in the same room with me but i could with harold STOP 
START he is probably our most original composer often uses very odd rhythms which makes it difficult and challenging for the lyric writer STOP 
START while arlen and mercer UNK on hot UNK mercer worked also with arthur UNK on another film navy blues STOP 
START arlen too worked on other projects at the same time with old friend UNK UNK STOP 
START besides doing a single song when the sun comes out they worked on the ambitious UNK suite for voices and piano as well as songs for films STOP 
START the UNK suite is in a sense an extension of the cotton club songs in that it is a collection of negro songs not for a night club but for the concert stage STOP 
START the work had its beginning in UNK with an UNK musical strain to which UNK set the words UNK be no more work be no more worry matching the spiritual feeling of the UNK STOP 
START this grew into the song big time UNK STOP 
START by september 1940 the suite had developed into a collection of six songs four UNK a dream and a UNK STOP 
START the negro composer hall johnson studied the UNK suite and said of it of all the many songs written by white composers and UNK what claims to be a UNK UNK in both words and music these six songs by harold arlen and UNK UNK easily stand far out above the rest STOP 
START thoroughly modern in treatment they are at the same time full of simple sincerity which invariably UNK genuine negro UNK and are by no means to be confused with the average broadway UNK which depend for their racial flavor upon UNK UNK to the amen corner UNK day UNK horn and a UNK devil with a few random UNK thrown in for good measure STOP

START UNK scotty did not go back to school STOP 
START his parents talked seriously and UNK to their own doctor and to a specialist at the university hospital mr. mckinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off spend a lot of time in bed and for the rest do pretty much as he chose provided of course he chose to do nothing too exciting or too UNK STOP 
START his teacher and his school principal were UNK with and everyone agreed that if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home there was little danger of his losing a term STOP 
START scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments STOP 
START he was UNK from the hospital after a UNK UNK and he and his parents had what mr. mckinley described as a celebration lunch at the cafeteria on the campus STOP 
START rachel wore a smart hat and because she had been warned recently about UNK UNK at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with UNK STOP 
START scotty's father sat sprawled in his chair angular alert as a UNK looking about at the huge UNK UNK of the room with an expression of UNK STOP 
START teachers men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to scotty and rachel STOP 
START rachel was UNK scotty indifferent STOP 
START they ate the cafeteria food with its orange UNK and scotty UNK without interest at his food the teachers the heroic UNK windows and the bright ranks of college UNK STOP 
START his father tried to make the food a UNK STOP 
START the UNK pie is good scotty STOP 
START i recommend it STOP 
START he looked at his son his face worried STOP 
START scotty murmured no thanks so softly his father had to bend his UNK height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him STOP 
START scotty regarded the ear and the UNK hair around it with a moment of interest STOP 
START he said more loudly i'm full old UNK STOP 
START he had eaten almost nothing on the UNK UNK plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper UNK STOP 
START he's all right UNK rachel said STOP 
START i can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home STOP 
START since his UNK scotty had had little appetite his changed appearance surprisingly was one of UNK STOP 
START his face was UNK lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become UNK STOP 
START he UNK now with his mouth open showing a UNK UNK section of lower teeth kept his eyes with their UNK UNK UNK always lowered though not apparently UNK STOP 
START even his neck seemed UNK and therefore shorter STOP 
START his hands which had been as quick as a pair of UNK birds were now neither active nor really relaxed STOP 
START they lay on his lap UNK up UNK UNK the UNK fingers a little thick at the joints STOP 
START altogether he had since the UNK the appearance of a boy who UNK in food and took no exercise STOP 
START he looked UNK UNK a little UNK STOP 
START rachel had little to say STOP 
START she greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling UNK offering nothing STOP 
START mr. mckinley for all his UNK and his easy familiarity was completely alert to his son eyes always on the still face UNK to anticipate scotty's desires STOP 
START it was a strained silent lunch STOP 
START rachel said i'd better get him to bed STOP 
START the doctors had suggested scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger STOP 
START since mr. mckinley had to give a lecture rachel and scotty drove home alone in the plymouth STOP 
START they did not speak much STOP 
START scotty UNK out at ugly gray UNK and said softly look at those stupid kids STOP 
START it was a negro section of UNK row houses UNK churches and UNK children STOP 
START rachel had to bend toward scotty and ask him to repeat STOP 
START he said nothing STOP 
START and then there are lots of kids around here STOP 
START scotty looked at the children his mouth slightly opened his eyes dull STOP 
START he felt tired and full and calm STOP 
START UNK the days seemed short perhaps because his routine was each day almost the same STOP 
START he rose late and went down in his UNK and UNK to have breakfast either alone or with rachel STOP 
START virginia treated him with attention and tried to UNK his appetite with special food UNK UNK UNK the result of devoted hours in the UNK kitchen STOP 
START she would UNK over him and looking like her brother UNK watch the progress of scotty's fork or UNK STOP 
START you don't eat enough honey STOP 
START try to get that down STOP 
START rachel observing would say he has to UNK his own capacity STOP 
START it'll take time STOP 
START virginia and rachel talked to each other quietly now as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere STOP 
START both watched scotty constantly rachel without seeming to virginia openly her eyes filled with concern STOP 
START scotty was neutral STOP 
START he did not UNK their supervision or UNK sometimes UNK sympathy STOP 
START he ate what he felt like slept as much or as little as he pleased and moved about the UNK rooms of the house when he was not in bed with slow UNK steps like an elderly tourist in a UNK STOP 
START his energy was gone STOP 
START he was able now to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the UNK yard without moving STOP 
START his hands lay loosely yet UNK they were like wax hands almost UNK not quite folded in his lap mouth hung slightly open STOP 
START when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was UNK he would answer as often happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or UNK only a little louder STOP 
START he had not mentioned kate STOP 
START he had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly almost UNK encounter her STOP 
START at these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest but it was an objective pain in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind was like the UNK wound on the back of his head which occasionally UNK was merely another part of his weakness STOP 
START he was calm UNK and UNK STOP 
START he did not care STOP 
START rachel mentioned kate STOP 
START she said i notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit STOP 
START scotty said that's all right STOP 
START UNK all right STOP 
START he thought about it briefly then deliberately turned the talk to something else STOP 
START once sitting at the front window in his UNK room he saw kate come out of her house STOP 
START she was with elizabeth STOP 
START they were far off and looked tiny STOP 
START the heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them STOP 
START they turned at the bottom of UNK steps and moved off in the direction of the park STOP 
START he thought he saw it UNK and for a moment interested him that elizabeth held a UNK in her hand and that a round UNK UNK was on the end of the UNK STOP 
START then they disappeared and scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed STOP 
START by the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing kate STOP 
START the doctor since scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him came often and UNK to the house STOP 
START he would sit UNK and spare on the edge of scotty's bed his legs crossed so UNK that the crossed foot could tap the floor STOP 
START scotty did not mind the doctor's UNK UNK as he used to STOP 
START UNK young man he said with UNK UNK STOP 
START i imagine you're always UNK in school STOP 
START i don't go to school any more STOP 
START UNK doctor had to bend close to hear delicate hand as UNK as a UNK wing rested UNK on scotty's chest STOP 
START scotty said the same words more loudly STOP 
START oh STOP 
START well we're taking a little vacation that's all STOP 
START he turned UNK to rachel STOP 
START i think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little STOP 
START he could now but the weakness is very definite would UNK him further and UNK STOP 
START he'll be stronger soon STOP 
START his UNK was on the table by scotty's bed and he picked it up and UNK it at scotty STOP 
START he said UNK just keep the cap on those strong emotions STOP 
START the UNK UNK silver in the UNK room STOP 
START i'll drop by again in a few days STOP 
START rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone STOP 
START she UNK the covers on scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor STOP 
START she did not touch him STOP 
START scotty watched with UNK STOP 
START he did not speak STOP 
START he had no desire to STOP 
START she said do you think you'll miss school had noticed how formal and UNK exact rachel had grown STOP 
START he did not care STOP 
START he felt her UNK did not concern him yet he knew he would not care even if it did STOP 
START he shook his head STOP 
START we've had any number of calls about you STOP 
START you could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble STOP 
START miss UNK called twice STOP 
START she wants to pay you a visit STOP 
START she says the children miss you STOP 
START apparently you were the light of their lives STOP 
START scotty shrugged slightly STOP 
START rachel came close to the bed bent as if she would kiss him then moved away STOP 
START she was frowning STOP 
START that doctor UNK me STOP 
START she seemed to speak to herself STOP 
START do you suppose his UNK is characteristic of the new negro UNK or merely of doctors in general turned to him again STOP 
START well mrs. charles sally has UNK too STOP 
START she was very worried STOP 
START UNK tone was dry STOP 
START she didn't really say she glanced away at the floor then UNK UNK and picked up one of scotty's UNK STOP 
START i mean do you feel like seeing kate said i don't know STOP 
START it was true STOP 
START he did not STOP 
START there was the slight pain but it was no different from the UNK in his head STOP 
START well there's time in any case STOP 
START we'll wait till you're stronger and then talk about it STOP 
START she put the UNK neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed STOP 
START scotty said okay STOP 
START this time rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead STOP 
START scotty was pleased STOP 
START his father was a constant visitor STOP 
START scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice UNK up the stairs STOP 
START UNK scotty UNK or UNK reply better STOP 
START he's getting plenty of rest STOP 
START is his appetite improved does he get exercise exchange was almost UNK and scotty in his bed could hear every word of it STOP 
START he never smiled STOP 
START it required an energy he no longer possessed to be UNK about his father STOP 
START his father would come upstairs and stand UNK at the foot of the bed and look at his son STOP 
START after a pause during which he studied scotty's face as if scotty were not there and could not study him too mr. mckinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs STOP 
START scotty would reply softly and his father UNK would ask him to repeat STOP 
START i'm eating more he would say STOP 
START or i walk around the house a lot STOP 
START perhaps you should get out a little STOP 
START i'm not supposed to yet STOP 
START he was not UNK STOP 
START he did not mind the useless UNK questions STOP 
START he looked at the lined face with vague interest felt he was noting it as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger STOP 
START mr. mckinley examined everything with critical care seeking something material to blame for his UNK illness STOP 
START have you got enough blankets another time without UNK you never wore that UNK i bought you STOP

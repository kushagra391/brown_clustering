START a former du pont official became a general motors vice president and set about UNK du pont's share of the general motors market STOP 
START lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du pont products were actively promoted STOP 
START within a few years various du pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of general UNK eight operating divisions STOP 
START the UNK body division long controlled by the UNK brothers under a voting trust even though general motors owned a majority of its stock followed an independent course for many years but by 1947 and 1948 resistance had collapsed and its purchases from du pont compared favorably with purchases by other general motors divisions STOP 
START UNK came to receive higher percentage of general motors business in later years but it is likely that this trend UNK at least in part from the needs of general motors UNK du pont's capacity STOP 
START the fact that sticks out in this UNK record is that the bulk of du pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du pont by a stock interest STOP 
START the UNK is overwhelming that du pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit STOP 
START UNK u. s. at UNK STOP 
START this court agreed with the trial court that considerations of price quality and service were not UNK by either du pont or general motors STOP 
START UNK u. s. at UNK STOP 
START however it determined that neither this factor nor the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted UNK and fairly each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to UNK anyone including du pont's UNK UNK the government's claim for relief STOP 
START this claim as submitted to the district court and dismissed by it UNK UNK UNK violation not only of 7 of the clayton act but also of 1 and 2 of the sherman act STOP 
START the latter provisions UNK any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and UNK of or attempts combinations or UNK to UNK such trade STOP 
START however this court put to one side without consideration the government's appeal from the UNK of its sherman act UNK STOP 
START it rested its decision solely on 7 which reads in pertinent part no corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially UNK competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition or to UNK such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce STOP 
START this section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about or in attempting to bring about the substantial UNK of competition STOP 
START the purpose of this provision was thus explained in the UNK opinion section 7 is designed to arrest in its UNK not only the substantial UNK of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation but also to arrest in their UNK UNK or UNK in a relevant market which as a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation STOP 
START the section is UNK whether or not actual UNK or UNK or the substantial UNK of competition have occurred or are intended STOP 
START UNK u. s. at UNK STOP 
START thus a finding of conspiracy to UNK trade or attempt to UNK was UNK from the UNK decision STOP 
START indeed as already noted the court proceeded on the assumption that the UNK involved in the UNK between du pont and general motors acted UNK and fairly and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies STOP 
START this however did not bar finding that du pont had become UNK as a UNK of UNK fabrics and UNK to general motors these products constituted a line of commerce within the meaning of the clayton act general UNK share of the market for these products was substantial that competition for this share of the market was UNK by the financial relationship between the two concerns the statutory policy of UNK free competition is obviously UNK when no UNK has an advantage over his UNK from an acquisition of his UNK stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute STOP 
START we repeat that the test of a violation of 7 is whether at the time of suit there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned UNK STOP 
START the conclusion upon this record is UNK that such UNK was proved as to this acquisition STOP 
START UNK u. s. at UNK STOP 
START on the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion the court UNK the case to the district court to determine the appropriate relief STOP 
START the sole guidance given the court for UNK the task committed to it was this the judgment must therefore be UNK and the cause UNK to the district court for a determination after further hearing of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition UNK to the statute STOP 
START the district courts in the UNK of equitable UNK are UNK with large discretion to model their UNK to fit the UNK of the particular case STOP 
START international salt co. v. united states UNK u. s. UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK u. s. at UNK STOP 
START this brings us to the course of the proceedings in the district court STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK UNK judgment was filed in the district court on july 18 1957 STOP 
START the first UNK conference held to UNK UNK UNK to represent the interest of the stockholders of du pont and general motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent UNK took place on september 25 1957 STOP 
START at the outset the government's spokesman explained that counsel for the government and for du pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court STOP 
START du pont he said had proposed UNK of its general motors stock along with other restrictions on the du pont general motors relationship STOP 
START the government UNK these suggestions inadequate had urged that any judgment include UNK of du pont's shares of general motors STOP 
START counsel for the government invited du pont's views on this proposal before UNK a specific program but stated that if the court desired or if counsel for du pont thought further discussion would not be profitable the government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days STOP 
START counsel for du pont indicated a UNK for the UNK of detailed plans by both sides at an early date STOP 
START no previous UNK case he said had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief STOP 
START the UNK of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of UNK or UNK in the abstract STOP 
START the court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out STOP 
START the government submitted its proposed UNK on october 25 1957 STOP 
START the plan called for UNK by du pont of its UNK shares of general motors stock by equal annual UNK to its stockholders as a UNK over a period of ten years STOP 
START UNK UNK company and delaware UNK investment company major stockholders in du pont and the stockholders of delaware were dealt with UNK by provisions requiring the annual sale by a UNK again over a UNK period of du pont's general motors stock UNK to them as well as any general motors stock which UNK and delaware owned UNK STOP 
START if in the UNK judgment reasonable market conditions did not UNK during any given year he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the UNK period STOP 
START in addition the right to vote the general motors stock held by du pont was to be UNK in du pont's stockholders other than UNK and delaware and the stockholders of delaware pont UNK and delaware were to be UNK from acquiring stock in or UNK control over general motors pont UNK and delaware were to be UNK to have any director or officer in common with general motors and vice UNK general motors and du pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by general motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du pont manufactured product or for the grant of exclusive patent rights or for a grant by general motors to du pont of a UNK right to make or sell any chemical discovery of general motors or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies STOP 
START on motion of the UNK UNK the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the commissioner of internal revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the government's plan STOP 
START on may 9 1958 the commissioner announced his UNK STOP 
START the annual UNK paid to du pont stockholders in shares of general motors stock would be UNK as ordinary income to the extent of du pont's earnings and profits STOP 
START the measure for federal income tax purposes of the UNK to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution STOP 
START in the case of UNK corporate stockholders the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or du pont's tax basis for them which is approximately UNK per share STOP 
START the forced sale of the general motors stock owned by or UNK to UNK delaware and the stockholders of delaware and UNK with the UNK would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate STOP 
START du pont's UNK was filed on may 14 1958 STOP 
START under its plan du pont would retain its general motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares STOP 
START UNK and delaware would in turn be required to pass on the voting rights to the general motors shares UNK to them to their own stockholders STOP 
START du pont would be UNK from having as a director officer or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of general motors and no director officer or employee of du pont could serve as a director of general motors without court approval STOP 
START du pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional general motors stock except through general UNK UNK of stock or UNK rights to its stockholders STOP 
START on june 6 1958 general motors submitted its objections to the government's proposal STOP 
START it argued UNK UNK that a UNK order would severely UNK the market value of the stock of both general motors and du pont with UNK serious loss and UNK to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors among them thousands of small UNK and UNK institutions there would be a similar decline in the market values of other UNK and chemical stocks with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies the tremendous volume of general motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would UNK the efforts of general motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise UNK capital that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity STOP 
START general motors UNK contended that the government plan would not be in the public interest as required by the UNK of this court STOP 
START the UNK proposed by the UNK UNK were filed in august of 1958 STOP 
START these plans like du pont's contained provisions for passing the vote on du pont's general motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of du pont UNK and delaware except that officers and directors of the three companies their UNK and other people living in their UNK as well as other specified persons were to be totally UNK STOP 
START both plans also UNK common directors officers or employees between du pont UNK and delaware on the one hand and general motors on the other STOP

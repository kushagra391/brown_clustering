START in most of the less developed countries however such programing is at best inadequate and at worst UNK STOP 
START only a very few of the more advanced ones such as india and UNK have developed systematic techniques of programing STOP 
START others have so-called development plans but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various UNK while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them STOP 
START only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation STOP 
START we can help in the planning process STOP 
START UNK growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country must express the nation's own will and goal STOP 
START nevertheless we can UNK an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing STOP 
START first we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs STOP 
START second we can make assistance for particular projects UNK on the consistency of such projects with the program STOP 
START third we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources STOP 
START this includes assistance in UNK the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depends the needs and requirements over time of broad UNK of the economy such as transport agriculture communication industry and power the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without UNK administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and UNK of programs once established STOP 
START we must use common sense in applying conditions STOP 
START -hlthe application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot of course be mechanical STOP 
START it must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions STOP 
START to insist on a level of performance in programing and UNK completely beyond the capabilities of the UNK country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth STOP 
START in the more primitive areas where the capacity to absorb and UNK external assistance is limited some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available STOP 
START thus we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education essential transport communications and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs STOP 
START in such a case however we would encourage the UNK country to get on with its programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country's development was UNK upon programing progress being made STOP 
START at the other end of the spectrum where the more advanced countries can be UNK upon to make well thought through decisions as to project UNK within a consistent program we should be prepared to UNK substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for UNK assistance and to move toward long-term support in cooperation with other developed countries of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program STOP 
START d STOP 
START UNK self-help 1 STOP 
START -hlthe reasons for UNK self-help a systematic approach to development UNK and programing is one important kind of self-help STOP 
START there are many others STOP 
START it is UNK important that the new u.s. aid program should encourage all of them since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves STOP 
START external aid can only be marginal although the UNK as in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive STOP 
START external aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help STOP 
START u.s. aid therefore should increasingly be designed to provide UNK for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take STOP 
START aid advice is not interference STOP 
START -hlin establishing conditions of self-help it is important that we not expect countries to UNK themselves in our image STOP 
START open societies can take many forms and within very broad limits UNK must be free to set their own goals and to UNK their own institutions to achieve those goals STOP 
START on the other hand it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them STOP 
START once we have made clear that we are UNK concerned with a country's development potential we can be UNK in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe range of self-help the major areas of self-help are the following a the effective UNK of resources STOP 
START UNK includes not only development programing but also establishing tax policies designed to raise UNK resources for investment and UNK policies designed to prevent serious UNK UNK policies aimed to attract the financial and UNK resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few STOP 
START b the reduction of dependence on external sources STOP 
START UNK includes UNK UNK crises with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports STOP 
START it also includes providing for the training of UNK to operate projects after they are completed STOP 
START c UNK the energies of the entire population STOP 
START UNK both economic and political reasons all UNK of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country STOP 
START otherwise development will not lead to UNK stability STOP 
START d UNK in government STOP 
START -hlin many societies what we regard as corruption UNK and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the UNK of UNK and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their UNK will be regarded by the local leadership as not only UNK but UNK STOP 
START yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if UNK corruption and UNK are widespread STOP 
START moreover UNK by us of such practices results in serious waste and UNK of aid resources and in the long run UNK UNK sentiment of a kind UNK UNK to our political interest STOP 
START some of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification correct or not of communist UNK with personal UNK and pro-western UNK with corruption STOP 
START a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run but it is politically essential in the long run STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK position on self-help the united states can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by UNK with aid on a sustained basis UNK to priority needs to those countries making serious efforts in self-help STOP 
START in many instances it can UNK or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts STOP 
START there are other countries where with UNK diplomacy we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth STOP 
START governments are rarely UNK STOP 
START but there will be still other countries where despite the UNK of the level of self-help we shall UNK it wise for political or military reasons to give substantial economic assistance STOP 
START even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to UNK STOP 
START e STOP 
START UNK a long-term approach 1 STOP 
START UNK requires a long-term approach STOP 
START -hlthe most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the UNK of our attention our resources and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries STOP 
START this is not a UNK goal STOP 
START to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years and we must encourage the UNK of our aid to view it in the same fashion STOP 
START most of our aid will go to those nearing UNK STOP 
START UNK long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country STOP 
START in several significant cases such as india a decade of concentrated effort can UNK these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no UNK assistance STOP 
START these cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the UNK are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance STOP 
START gradually others will move up to the same level STOP 
START -hlthe number of countries thus favorably situated is small but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the UNK world STOP 
START meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into UNK growth STOP 
START in still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into UNK the decade can bring significant progress in UNK the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of UNK activities is possible STOP 
START aid is a long-term process STOP 
START -hlthe whole program must be conceived of as an effort stretching over a considerable number of years to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world STOP 
START it must be recognized as a UNK tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in laos and cuba STOP 
START it is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have UNK STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe specific reasons for a long-term approach a the need to budget a period of years STOP 
START many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods STOP 
START UNK river development UNK transportation networks educational systems require years to construct STOP 
START moreover on complex projects design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can UNK STOP 
START thus as a development program is being launched commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by UNK or UNK the expenditures to be made in that year STOP 
START the capital expansion programs of business firms involve UNK UNK and the same is true of country development programs STOP 
START b the need to plan investment programs STOP 
START UNK UNK several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and UNK for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various UNK activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence STOP 
START without such forward planning investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed STOP 
START c the need to UNK country resources STOP 
START UNK important of all the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to UNK and commit their own resources STOP 
START they must be induced to establish the necessary tax fiscal UNK and UNK policies STOP 
START they must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section STOP 
START the taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions STOP 
START moreover once these steps are taken they may require years to make themselves felt STOP 
START they must therefore be related to long-range development plans STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK an incentive if the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach the united states as the principal UNK of external aid must be prepared to give long-term commitments STOP 
START in this as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones STOP 
START the extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to UNK their own resources to set targets toward which they should be working to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent UNK for their immediate attention and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic long-term basis will depend UNK on the UNK we place before them STOP 
START if they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required STOP 
START perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments STOP

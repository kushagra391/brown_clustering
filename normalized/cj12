START the UNK and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout STOP 
START the pulmonary vein however without the limiting UNK tissue UNK as in type 1 follows a more direct path to the UNK and does not maintain this close relationship figs. 8 22 STOP 
START another marked difference is noted here STOP 
START the pulmonary artery in addition to supplying the UNK portion of the respiratory UNK the UNK UNK and the UNK continues on and directly supplies the thin UNK fig. 8 STOP 
START the bronchial artery except for a small number of short branches in the UNK UNK none of the UNK blood supply STOP 
START it does as in type 1 supply the UNK UNK UNK the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the UNK and the UNK UNK in a common UNK bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory UNK STOP 
START no bronchial UNK artery UNK were noted in this group STOP 
START lung type 3 fig. 3 is to some degree a composite of types 1 and 2 STOP 
START it is characterized by the presence of UNK developed secondary UNK defined but UNK arranged UNK UNK and a thick remarkably UNK UNK fig. 9 STOP 
START the most UNK UNK are similar to those found in type 1 being composed of numerous apparently true terminal UNK and occasional poorly developed respiratory UNK figs. 14 15 STOP 
START in this instance because of incomplete UNK the secondary UNK does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1 STOP 
START UNK from one area to another are therefore conceivable STOP 
START UNK the UNK is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other as in type 1 fig. 24 STOP 
START this relationship however is not maintained UNK STOP 
START here the pulmonary vein as in type 2 is noted to draw away from the UNK and to follow a more direct independent course to the UNK figs. 23 24 STOP 
START the bronchial artery in its course and distribution UNK somewhat from that found in other UNK STOP 
START as seen in types 1 and 2 it supplies the UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK to the pulmonary artery and vein the UNK and the terminal UNK STOP 
START as in type 1 it provides UNK blood to the UNK UNK and an extremely rich UNK UNK supply is seen figs. 9 10 STOP 
START this UNK supply is derived both from UNK and UNK bronchial artery branches STOP 
START such a UNK UNK was UNK demonstrated during the UNK process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated UNK vessels at once STOP 
START some of these were obviously filling from UNK branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct UNK branches following along the UNK surface STOP 
START with completion of filling UNK UNK were noted to be present between these separately derived branches STOP 
START an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted STOP 
START this was UNK for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery STOP 
START the diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere UNK UNK figs. 16 23 24 STOP 
START in UNK regions its diameter would be UNK to UNK that of the pulmonary artery STOP 
START this vessel could be followed to the UNK where it directly provided bronchial UNK blood to the UNK UNK bed figs. 17 18 STOP 
START also three other direct UNK of UNK bronchial UNK supply were noted via the UNK the UNK UNK along the terminal UNK figs. 14 17 18 19 STOP 
START one bronchial UNK UNK UNK was noted at the terminal UNK level fig. 26 STOP 
START discussion it is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an UNK comparison is made STOP 
START the significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding UNK differences been determined STOP 
START however the UNK of UNK from UNK considerations alone may UNK be different in the UNK than in the horse STOP 
START the volume and perhaps even the characteristics of bronchial UNK blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse STOP 
START also UNK air UNK may be all but UNK in the cow occur in the horse much as in the human being in contrast are present to a relatively immense degree on a UNK basis in the dog where UNK are absent van allen and UNK UNK STOP 
START a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary UNK is entirely lacking at present STOP 
START within certain wide limits UNK UNK function and if one is permitted to UNK potential pathology should be included in this statement as well STOP 
START for example the marked UNK of the UNK to respiratory UNK might be related to its delicate long UNK UNK and short large UNK situated within a UNK entirely lacking in protective UNK tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 and 3 STOP 
START one might also wonder if UNK are capable of developing UNK as we know it in man or the horse STOP 
START in addition it would be difficult to imagine chronic UNK UNK occurring in a cow considering its marked UNK development but UNK not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog STOP 
START UNK the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man UNK as this can be UNK from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others UNK UNK in the human being STOP 
START the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the UNK distribution of the bronchial arteries STOP 
START as early as UNK le fort claimed an UNK distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings STOP 
START in 1951 this was UNK by UNK STOP 
START the opposition to this point of view has its UNK support in the work of miller UNK STOP 
START apparently however miller has UNK heavily on the UNK in dogs and cats and he has been criticized for using UNK human material in his normal study UNK UNK STOP 
START although miller noted in UNK that a difference in the UNK blood supply existed between animals nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the UNK features of various UNK lungs other than in the dog and cat miller UNK STOP 
START the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear STOP 
START however this artery is known to be a UNK vessel with a distribution primarily to the UNK UNK and UNK tissues of the lung STOP 
START the UNK and respiratory UNK are primarily UNK tissues STOP 
START UNK they are capable of UNK their required oxygen either from the surrounding air UNK and UNK UNK or from pulmonary UNK blood UNK UNK STOP 
START therefore an explanation of this UNK bronchial artery supply might be the UNK requirement of an increased amount of UNK tissue not primarily UNK in nature in the region of the UNK STOP 
START if this be true the possibility exists that an UNK UNK of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread UNK of UNK tissue similar to that seen in UNK UNK STOP 
START one would not expect such an event to occur in animals UNK lungs of types 1 or 2 STOP 
START the presence of normally occurring bronchial UNK artery UNK was first noted in UNK by UNK and thereafter by many others STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and watson UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK have all claimed their normal but relatively UNK existence in the human being STOP 
START miller UNK is the principal UNK of this viewpoint STOP 
START in criticism of the UNK views his conclusions were based upon dog lung UNK studies in which all of the UNK channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were UNK with various UNK colored particles designed to stop at the UNK level STOP 
START as early as 1913 UNK and UNK demonstrated with UNK studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK in UNK and UNK in 1958 UNK this STOP 
START our own studies in which bronchial UNK artery UNK were demonstrated were accomplished by UNK the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by UNK the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards STOP 
START it is distinctly possible therefore that UNK pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the UNK UNK and hence UNK STOP 
START this viewpoint is further supported by UNK UNK demonstration of UNK bronchial artery and UNK muscular UNK which are capable of acting as UNK STOP 
START in other words the UNK between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand UNK STOP 
START in addition little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial UNK artery UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK found these UNK in the human being but was unable to find them in UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK also were unable to find them in UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK was unable to demonstrate their existence either by UNK or UNK methods in dogs STOP 
START the possibility that the absence or presence of these UNK is UNK is therefore UNK STOP 
START certainly the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not UNK deny their existence in that species STOP 
START it is however highly UNK and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial UNK artery UNK in certain species especially the dog STOP 
START in conclusion these findings suggest the need for a comparative UNK pathology and UNK of UNK lungs STOP 
START in addition a detailed UNK survey of the UNK of UNK pulmonary UNK in UNK would be interesting and pertinent STOP 
START also for the present great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man STOP 
START this is especially so if the dog cat or UNK are to be used in view of their marked UNK differences from man STOP 
START finally it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be UNK more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species STOP 
START summary the main UNK UNK features of the lungs of various UNK are presented STOP 
START a UNK of these features permits the lungs to be UNK into three distinctive UNK types STOP 
START type 1 is represented by the cow sheep and UNK 2 by the dog cat and UNK 3 by the horse STOP 
START UNK is extremely well developed in type 1 in type 2 developed in type 3 STOP 
START the UNK and UNK UNK are thick in types 1 and 3 STOP 
START the UNK is extremely thin in type 2 and UNK are absent STOP 
START UNK supply to the UNK in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery and in type 2 by the pulmonary artery STOP 
START in types 1 2 and 3 the bronchial artery UNK in a UNK bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the UNK UNK STOP 
START in type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the UNK UNK bed STOP 
START true terminal UNK comprise the most frequent form taken by the UNK UNK in types 1 and 3 although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory UNK are present STOP 
START well developed respiratory UNK on the other hand appear to be the only form taken by the UNK UNK in type 2 STOP 
START in type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the UNK and the pulmonary artery from the UNK to the UNK STOP 
START this may be due to the heavy UNK UNK tissue barriers present STOP 
START in type 3 this general relationship is maintained UNK but not UNK where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the UNK as is the case throughout the lung in type 2 STOP

START my interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the UNK of religious and ethnic bonds STOP 
START jewish identity was often confused with social and economic UNK STOP 
START being jewish gives you tremendous drive a boy remarked STOP 
START it means that you have to get ahead STOP 
START when i pressed for a purely religious definition i encountered the familiar UNK of liberal UNK UNK good will and a small UNK of ethnic loyalty STOP 
START i like the tradition a girl said STOP 
START i like to follow the holidays when they come along STOP 
START but you don't have to worship in the traditional way STOP 
START you can communicate in your own way STOP 
START as i see it there's no real difference between being jewish catholic or protestant STOP 
START another UNK remarked most jews don't believe in god but they believe in people in helping people STOP 
START still another boy asserted to be a good jew is to do no wrong to be a good person STOP 
START when asked how this was different from being a good protestant the boy answered it's the same thing STOP 
START this UNK with the study by UNK and UNK STOP 
START they discovered that although 42 per cent of a sample of catholic students and 15 per cent of the protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the UNK of their religion only 8 per cent of the jewish students had this conviction STOP 
START the most important aims of the jewish students were as follows to make the world a better place to live in 30 per cent get happiness for yourself 28 per cent financial independence 21 per cent STOP 
START nevertheless most of the teen-agers i interviewed believed in maintaining their jewish identity and even UNK joining a UNK or temple STOP 
START however they were hostile to jewish UNK UNK to believe in UNK but in a moderate way STOP 
START one boy said UNK about orthodox jews it's the twentieth century and they don't have to wear UNK STOP 
START the reason offered for UNK to the UNK faith lacked force and authority even in the UNK minds STOP 
START we were brought up that way was one statement which won general UNK STOP 
START i want to show respect for my UNK religion was the way in which a boy justified his UNK a halfway house of UNK STOP 
START still another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons since i'll be living in a suburb STOP 
START UNK which is generally regarded as a threat to jewish survival was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval STOP 
START most of the teen-agers i interviewed rejected it on UNK grounds STOP 
START when you marry you want to have things in common a girl said and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your own background STOP 
START a UNK girl from the middle west observed UNK that in her community religion UNK UNK with religious activities at least with the UNK activities that many middle class jews now regard as religious STOP 
START it appears that an orthodox girl in the community UNK plans for an UNK sponsored by one of the jewish service groups because she would not travel on saturday and in addition required UNK food STOP 
START another girl from a relatively large UNK city described herself as the only orthodox girl in town STOP 
START this is no doubt UNK but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the UNK STOP 
START the older UNK one of the significant things about jewish culture in the older UNK years is that it is largely UNK STOP 
START UNK per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning STOP 
START this is substantially higher than the figures for the american population at large UNK per cent for males and UNK per cent for females STOP 
START this may help explain a phenomenon described by a UNK jewish boy STOP 
START in their first two years in high school jewish boys in this town make strenuous UNK to win positions on the school teams STOP 
START however in their junior and senior years they generally UNK their athletic UNK presumably in the interest of better academic achievement STOP 
START it is significant too that the older teen-agers i interviewed believed unlike the younger ones that jewish students tend to do better UNK than their gentile counterparts STOP 
START the percentage of jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys STOP 
START the UNK for both sexes to be sure are different STOP 
START the vocational motive is the dominant one for boys while jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become UNK developed STOP 
START one of the significant developments in UNK life is that the cultural UNK are largely the women STOP 
START it is they who read and make jewish UNK and then persuade their husbands to read them STOP 
START in upper UNK jewish life the UNK group tends to have a sense of UNK STOP 
START people automatically assume that i'm in college a UNK UNK observed UNK STOP 
START however among the girls there are some UNK UNK for not going to college STOP 
START the jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office in UNK to gentile factory workers and UNK by a respectable income she is likely to dress better and live more UNK than the college student STOP 
START she is even prone to regard the college girl as UNK STOP 
START the UNK class college student one of the reasons for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost STOP 
START this is particularly true in large centers of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia STOP 
START what is UNK about this large group of teen-agers is that although their attitudes hardly UNK them from their gentile counterparts they actually lead their lives in a vast UNK jewish UNK with relatively little contact with the UNK world STOP 
START perhaps the jewish students at brooklyn college UNK UNK per cent of those who attend the day session can serve as a UNK of the urban UNK class jewish student STOP 
START there is to begin an important sex difference STOP 
START typically in a UNK class jewish family a son will be sent to an UNK school if financial resources warrant it while the daughter will attend the local college STOP 
START there are two reasons for this STOP 
START first the UNK education has a lower priority than the UNK STOP 
START second the attitude in jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son STOP 
START most jewish mothers are determined to exercise UNK over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home STOP 
START the consequence of this is that the girls at brooklyn college UNK the boys and do somewhat better UNK STOP 
START one can assume that some of the UNK boys are out of town STOP 
START brooklyn college students have an UNK attitude toward their school STOP 
START on the one hand there is a sense of not having moved beyond the UNK of their high school STOP 
START this is particularly acute for those who attended UNK high school directly across the street from brooklyn college STOP 
START they have a sense of UNK at being denied that special UNK of status the UNK school STOP 
START at the same time there is a good deal of UNK at attending a good college they are even inclined to UNK its not UNK virtues and they express pleasure at the UNK UNK feeling that the college UNK STOP 
START it's people of your own kind a girl remarked STOP 
START you don't have to watch what you say STOP 
START of course i would like to go to an UNK school where there are all kinds of people but i would want lots of jewish kids there STOP 
START for most brooklyn college students college is at once a UNK of their ethnic UNK and a breaking away from the UNK of neighborhood and family STOP 
START brooklyn college is UNK jewish in tone and efforts to UNK the college by bringing in UNK UNK types on the faculty have been UNK STOP 
START however a growing intellectual UNK and the new UNK UNK by courses in psychology and UNK make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat UNK and UNK parents STOP 
START and the rebellion of these third generation jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they view as softly and UNK UNK STOP 
START as long as i'm home i'll never grow up a UNK boy observed sadly STOP 
START they don't like it if i do anything away from home STOP 
START it's so much trouble i don't usually bother STOP 
START for girls the UNK is far more UNK STOP 
START parents will drive on friday night to pick up their daughters after a UNK or house plan meeting STOP 
START a UNK UNK father not too long ago called a dean at brooklyn college and demanded the UNK on a boy who was going out with his daughter STOP 
START the domestic UNK even extend to the choice of a major field STOP 
START under pressure from parents the majority of brooklyn college girls major in education since that UNK best with marriage plans limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours STOP 
START this means that a great many UNK UNK girls are discouraged from UNK graduate work of a more demanding nature STOP 
START a kind of double standard exists here for jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex STOP 
START the breaking away from the prison house of brooklyn is gradual STOP 
START first the student trains on his UNK parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights STOP 
START then with the new UNK there is actually a UNK forth into the wide wide world beyond the UNK of new york STOP 
START it is significant that the UNK which used to be the summer UNK for older teen-agers a kind of summer suburb of new york no longer UNK them in great numbers except for those who work there as UNK bus boys or UNK in the day camps STOP 
START the great world beyond UNK STOP 
START but it should be pointed out that some of the new UNK places fire island UNK UNK long island for example tend to be UNK jewish STOP 
START although brooklyn college does not yet have a UNK program a good number of students spend summers in europe STOP 
START in general however the UNK of travel UNK considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith STOP 
START and UNK into the world at large is likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school years STOP 
START brooklyn college is UNK UNK territory as much as the UNK or central park west STOP 
START there are UNK of UNK young women there who UNK by their UNK mothers are determined to marry STOP 
START it is interesting that although the percentage of married students is not UNK higher at brooklyn than elsewhere about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the UNK class the anxiety of the UNK has UNK up the estimate STOP 
START almost everybody in the senior class is married students say UNK STOP 
START and the school newspaper sells space to UNK UNK UNK and houses in the house plan association that have good news to UNK STOP 
START these UNK are in effect UNK for themselves as UNK marriage UNK STOP 
START there are UNK UNK in the newspaper of UNK UNK UNK UNK and marriages in a UNK UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START UNK house happily UNK the engagement of UNK UNK to UNK UNK of UNK house STOP 
START the brooklyn college student shows some striking UNK from prevailing UNK models STOP 
START the UNK league UNK no easy UNK here and the boys are as likely to dress in rather UNK continental fashion or even in UNK working class manner as they are in the restrained UNK UNK way STOP 
START the girls are prone to dress far more UNK than their counterparts out of town and eye shadow UNK and elaborate UNK UNK despite the UNK of UNK guidance personnel are not unknown even in early morning classes STOP 
START among the boys there is very little UNK about drinking STOP 
START brooklyn college is distinctive for not having an official drinking place STOP 
START the fort UNK UNK for drinking is foreign to most brooklyn college boys STOP

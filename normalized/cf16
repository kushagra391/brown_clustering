START on april 17 UNK the sturdy little UNK bark discovery weighed anchor in st. UNK pool london and UNK down the UNK toward the sea STOP 
START she carried besides her captain a crew of UNK and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the UNK waters of north america STOP 
START seventeen months later on september 6 UNK an irish fishing boat UNK the discovery UNK UNK outside UNK bay STOP 
START when she reached port she was found to have on board only eight men all near UNK STOP 
START the captain was gone and the mate was gone STOP 
START the man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary UNK STOP 
START what disaster struck the discovery during those seventeen months happened to the fourteen missing men questions have remained one of the great sea UNK of all time STOP 
START for hundreds of years the evidence available consisted of 1 the UNK UNK journal 2 a highly UNK account by one of the survivors 3 a note found in a dead man's desk on board and 4 several UNK reports STOP 
START all told they offered a highly confused picture STOP 
START but since 1927 UNK UNK into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find UNK pieces of information STOP 
START not enough to do away with all doubts but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage STOP 
START historians have had two reasons for UNK so long in their investigations STOP 
START first they wanted to clarify a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START second they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain a man whose name is permanently UNK on our maps on american towns and counties on a great american river and on half a million square miles of UNK UNK STOP 
START the name henry hudson STOP 
START this is the story of his last tragic voyage as nearly as we are able or ever probably will be able to determine the sailing in the spring of UNK was hudson's fourth in four years STOP 
START each time his objective had been the same a direct water passage from western europe to the far east STOP 
START in UNK and UNK the english UNK company had sent him UNK to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia STOP 
START twice he had failed and the UNK company indicated it would not back him again STOP 
START in UNK the dutch east india company hired hudson gave him two learned UNK fitted him out with a ship called the half moon and supplied him with dutch UNK STOP 
START this time he turned UNK to the middle atlantic coast of north america STOP 
START his chief discovery was important the great north later the hudson river but it produced no northwest passage STOP 
START when the half moon put in at dartmouth england in the fall of UNK word of hudson's findings UNK out and english interest in him UNK STOP 
START the government UNK hudson to return to UNK with his ship STOP 
START he UNK went to london and spent the winter talking to men of wealth STOP 
START by UNK he was supported by a rich merchant UNK under the UNK of henry prince of UNK STOP 
START he had obtained and UNK a veteran ship called the discovery and had UNK a crew of UNK the largest he had ever commanded STOP 
START the purpose of this fourth voyage was clear STOP 
START a century of exploration had established that a great land mass north and south america lay between europe and the UNK STOP 
START one by one the UNK in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and UNK STOP 
START in fact hudson's sail up the great north river had disposed of one of the last hopes STOP 
START but there remained one mysterious UNK gap far to the north STOP 
START nearly twenty-five years before captain john davis had noted as he UNK near the UNK circle a very great gulf the water UNK and UNK as it were the meeting of UNK STOP 
START he named this opening between UNK island and UNK the UNK UNK STOP 
START later it was to be called hudson UNK STOP 
START in UNK george UNK in the same little discovery that hudson now commanded had UNK 300 miles up the UNK before his frightened men turned the ship back STOP 
START hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the UNK beyond for the UNK UNK STOP 
START even hudson experienced in UNK sailing and determined as he was must have had UNK as he slid down the UNK STOP 
START ahead were UNK UNK waters STOP 
START on previous UNK it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain STOP 
START on the second voyage he had turned back at the frozen island of UNK UNK and UNK given the crew a UNK stating that he did so of his own free will which was obviously not the case STOP 
START on the third voyage a UNK rising from a quarrel between dutch and english crew members on the half moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to UNK in UNK STOP 
START worse his present crew included five men who had UNK with him before STOP 
START of only one could he be sure young john hudson his second son STOP 
START the mate robert UNK who had kept the journal on the half moon was experienced but he was a bitter old man ready to complain or desert at any opportunity STOP 
START philip UNK the UNK UNK was a good worker but UNK independent STOP 
START arnold UNK and michael UNK were like the rest UNK ready to swing against hudson in a crisis STOP 
START but men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be UNK like eggs were hard to find STOP 
START hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an UNK STOP 
START and he refused to be anything else STOP 
START it is believed that hudson was related to other UNK men of the UNK company and was trained on company ships STOP 
START he was a UNK married with three sons STOP 
START the common UNK that he was dutch and that his first name was UNK stem from dutch documents of his third voyage STOP 
START in UNK hudson was probably in his early UNK a good UNK a stubborn UNK but otherwise UNK UNK to his chosen profession STOP 
START hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the UNK STOP 
START there at the UNK edge waited one henry greene whom hudson listed as a clerk STOP 
START greene was in UNK a young UNK from kent who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START he was not the sort of UNK hudson wanted his UNK to see on board and he had greene wait at UNK where the discovery picked him up STOP 
START for the first three weeks the ship UNK up the east coast of great britain then turned UNK STOP 
START on may 11 she reached UNK STOP 
START poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called UNK bay STOP 
START the subsequent UNK wait made the crew UNK STOP 
START with hudson looking on his UNK greene picked a fight with the UNK surgeon edward wilson STOP 
START the issue was settled on shore greene winning and wilson remaining UNK determined to catch the next fishing boat back to england STOP 
START with difficulty hudson persuaded him to UNK the ship and they UNK from UNK STOP 
START early in june the discovery passed UNK southern UNK and in UNK entered the UNK UNK STOP 
START floating ice bore down from the north and west STOP 
START fog hung over the route constantly STOP 
START UNK UNK rose as much as fifty feet STOP 
START the UNK compass was useless because of the UNK of the magnetic north pole STOP 
START as the UNK grew larger hudson was forced to turn south into what is now UNK bay an UNK of the great UNK STOP 
START after finding that its UNK led nowhere however he turned north again toward the main UNK UNK and the crew at first uneasy then frightened UNK STOP 
START the trouble was at least partly UNK doing STOP 
START for weeks he had been saying that hudson's idea of sailing through to UNK was absurd STOP 
START the great UNK ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason STOP 
START a group of UNK announced to hudson that they would sail no farther STOP 
START instead of UNK the UNK as many UNK of the era would have done sir francis UNK UNK a man's head off under similar circumstances hudson decided to be reasonable STOP 
START he went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart which he set up in view of the crew STOP 
START UNK he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives STOP 
START when hudson had finished the town meeting broke down into a general UNK argument STOP 
START one man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds he would give ninety of them to be back in england STOP 
START up spoke UNK UNK who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home STOP 
START the statement was effective STOP 
START the meeting broke up STOP 
START hudson was free to sail on STOP 
START all through july the discovery picked her way along the UNK UNK avoiding ice and UNK islands STOP 
START on august 3 two massive UNK UNK out of the UNK great UNK never before so far as hudson knew seen by UNK STOP 
START to UNK was a cape a thousand feet high UNK with ice and snow populated by thousands of screaming sea birds STOP 
START to port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a UNK of UNK feet STOP 
START hudson named the UNK UNK and UNK for two of his UNK STOP 
START hudson pointed the discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea now called hudson bay confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the pacific STOP 
START after three UNK swift sailing however the ship entered an area of shallow UNK and river UNK STOP 
START the ship halted STOP 
START the great sea to the UNK was a dead end STOP 
START this must have been hudson's UNK discovery STOP 
START for he seemed to sense at once that before him was no south sea but the solid bulk of the north american continent STOP 
START this was the bitter end and hudson seemed to know he was UNK to failure STOP 
START UNK he tried to brush away this intuition STOP 
START north and south east and west back and forth he UNK in the UNK bay plowing furiously forward until land appeared then turning to repeat the process day after day week after week STOP 
START hundreds of miles to the north the route back to england through the UNK UNK was again filling with ice STOP 
START the men were at first puzzled then UNK by the UNK UNK STOP 
START once more UNK UNK were the UNK STOP 
START hudson's reply was to UNK the mate of UNK STOP 
START UNK demanded that hudson prove his charges in an open trial STOP 
START the trial was held september 10 STOP 
START hudson UNK heard UNK defense then called for testimony from crew members STOP 
START UNK had made UNK enemies several men stepped forward STOP 
START hands on bible UNK UNK and UNK UNK swore that UNK had tried to persuade them to keep UNK and UNK in their UNK STOP 
START cook UNK UNK said UNK had predicted UNK on the ship STOP 
START others added that UNK had wanted to turn the ship UNK STOP 
START hudson UNK UNK and cut his pay STOP 
START the new mate was robert UNK UNK but UNK STOP 
START there were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves STOP 
START the important result however was that UNK and francis UNK the UNK UNK became hudson's UNK enemies STOP 
START as hudson resumed his desperate UNK of the little bay every incident UNK the UNK respect for him STOP 
START once after the discovery lay for a week in rough weather hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had UNK STOP 
START just as it was being UNK UNK a sea hit the ship STOP 
START michael butt and UNK moore were thrown off the UNK and badly injured STOP 
START the anchor UNK would have been lost UNK but philip UNK was on hand to UNK it with his UNK STOP

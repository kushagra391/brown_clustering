START but again we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century UNK when an UNK scholar UNK UNK UNK UNK is said to have discussed the magic square of three STOP 
START thus while it remains possible that the UNK and the UNK may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the chinese did more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe lo shu square as an expression of UNK the concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and united under a UNK UNK which had been only a UNK ideal in the time of the UNK states was finally realized by the establishment of a chinese empire under the UNK UNK UNK b.c. STOP 
START but this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START among the many severe measures taken by the first emperor UNK UNK in his efforts to insure the continuation of this UNK national unity was the burning of the books in UNK b.c. with the expressed intention of UNK possible sources for UNK thinking as he had a special UNK for magic and UNK he ordered that books on these subjects should be UNK STOP 
START many of the latter were destroyed in their turn during the burning of the vast UNK palace some ten years later some must have survived because the old interest in number UNK UNK and magic UNK on into the UNK UNK which succeeded in UNK china and keeping it together for a longer period from UNK b.c. to UNK UNK STOP 
START in fact during the first century b.c. an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects finding its typical expression in the so-called UNK books a number of which were specifically devoted to the lo shu and related numerical UNK especially in connection with UNK STOP 
START however the UNK books were also destroyed in a series of orthodox UNK UNK which UNK in a final UNK in UNK STOP 
START after all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu which was already UNK anyhow STOP 
START but in spite of all this enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult or series of UNK reaching UNK expression in the UNK period STOP 
START although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere mathematical UNK was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and UNK of the UNK chinese for so many centuries they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself STOP 
START but up to now no one has attempted to UNK its inherent mathematical properties or the numerical significance of its numbers UNK or in combination and then tried to consider these in the light of old chinese UNK concepts STOP 
START such an analysis UNK reveals why the middle number of the lo shu 5 was so UNK significant for the chinese ever since the earliest UNK that they had a knowledge of this UNK STOP 
START the importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers quite apart from any UNK considerations which is to say any symbolic meaning UNK assigned to it STOP 
START indeed UNK speaking it was both UNK and UNK the most important number in the entire UNK STOP 
START if one takes the middle number 5 and UNK it by 3 the base number of the magic square of three the result is 15 which is also the constant sum of all the rows columns and two main UNK STOP 
START then if the middle number is UNK to its greatest potential in terms of this square through UNK it by the highest number 9 which is the square of the base number the result is 45 the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square by which all the other numbers are UNK and in which they may be said to be absorbed STOP 
START furthermore the middle number of the lo shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers by reason of its central position is also their mathematical mean since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair all of which equal 10 STOP 
START in fact the neat balance of these pairs and their subtle equilibrium would have had special meaning in the minds of the old chinese STOP 
START for they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female UNK the two groups with the yang and UNK principles in nature in this square the respective pairs made up of large and small odd yang numbers and those composed of large and small even UNK numbers were all equal to each other STOP 
START thus all differences were leveled and all contrasts UNK in a realm of no distinction and the UNK balance of the lo shu square could effectively UNK the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis STOP 
START the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square for purely mathematical reasons and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so UNK the number 5 and why they put so much stress on the concept of UNK STOP 
START these UNK UNK seem to have reached their height in the UNK UNK STOP 
START the existing UNK for UNK must have been still further UNK toward the close of the second century b.c. when the UNK emperor UNK UNK ordered the UNK color changed to yellow which symbolized the center among the traditional five directions and took 5 as the UNK number believing that he would thus place himself his imperial family and the nation under the most UNK influences STOP 
START his immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the lo shu but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the UNK UNK STOP 
START after this time UNK on the UNK bronze UNK as well as other writings emphasized the UNK of keeping one's self at the center of the universe where cosmic forces were strongest STOP 
START later we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally STOP 
START all this emphasis on UNK and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the center which seems to have begun as far back as 400 b.c. also may UNK have led to the development of the UNK school and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five STOP 
START we find for example such UNK as the five ancient UNK the five sacred mountains the five directions with center the five UNK five colors five UNK five UNK five musical notes five UNK functions five UNK and many others STOP 
START this trend has often been UNK to the cult of the five elements itself as though they had served as the base for all the rest why did the old chinese UNK five elements when the ancient near east which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities recognized only four why did the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five directions when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of UNK and that may have been the UNK of the lo shu STOP 
START this whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on chinese thinking STOP 
START whereas the primary meanings of the lo shu UNK seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases the urgent desire to place everything into categories of UNK led to other UNK based on other numbers until an exaggerated emphasis on mere UNK UNK chinese thought STOP 
START scholars made UNK sets of as many things as possible in nature or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as UNK UNK and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to UNK UNK thought in china for many centuries STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK and yang in the lo shu square although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the lo shu and the UNK of all the other numbers to it might seem enough to account for the deep UNK which the lo shu held for the old chinese UNK this was actually only a beginning of UNK STOP 
START for the lo shu square was a remarkably complete UNK of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time STOP 
START as such one cannot fully understand the thought of the UNK and UNK periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the lo shu UNK one cannot begin to understand the lo shu without knowing something about the world view of the old chinese which they felt they saw expressed in it STOP 
START the chinese world view during the UNK UNK when the lo shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity was based in large part on the UNK of the UNK and UNK school which was UNK founded by UNK UNK STOP 
START according to this doctrine the universe was ruled by heaven UNK as a natural force or in the UNK of a supreme UNK governing all things by means of a process called the UNK which can be roughly interpreted as the order of the universe or the universal way STOP 
START heaven acting through the UNK expressed itself by means of the UNK of two basic principles the UNK and the yang STOP 
START the yang or male principle was the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associated with the sun the UNK or female principle UNK in darkness cold and quiet UNK and was associated with the moon STOP 
START together these two principles influenced all things and in varying combinations they were present in everything STOP 
START we have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being yang while the even numbers were UNK so that the eight outer numbers of the lo shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the UNK center STOP 
START during the UNK UNK another UNK conception was applied to the lo shu considering the latter as a plan of ancient china STOP 
START instead of UNK the nine numbers of this UNK with the traditional nine provinces as was usually done this UNK the odd yang numbers with mountains firm and UNK hence yang and the even numbers with rivers UNK and UNK hence UNK the former from the five sacred mountains of the UNK period and the latter from the principal river systems of old china STOP 
START thus the middle number 5 represented UNK in UNK central china 3 UNK in UNK east china 7 UNK in UNK west china 1 UNK in UNK north china or the mountain with the same name in neighboring UNK the 9 UNK in UNK which was then the south sacred mountain STOP 
START for the rivers the 4 represented the UNK to the then southeast 2 the san UNK three rivers in the then southwest 8 the UNK in the northeast the 6 the upper yellow river in the northwest STOP 
START note that by western standards this plan was UNK down as it put north at the bottom and south at the top with the other directions UNK altered in this respect it was merely following the accepted chinese convention for all maps STOP 
START the same arrangement was used when the lo shu was UNK with the nine provinces whenever the lo shu involved UNK UNK it was oriented in this same fashion STOP

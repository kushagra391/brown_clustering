START whenever artists indeed turned to actual UNK or molded UNK figures which were rare down to 800 b.c. they tended to reflect reality see plate UNK UNK UNK abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the late eighth century STOP 
START to speak of this underlying view of the world is to UNK upon matters of subjective judgment STOP 
START at the least however one may conclude that geometric UNK sensed a logical order principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric UNK and the UNK line STOP 
START their world again was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life STOP 
START and perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in UNK that the outlook of their makers and UNK was basically stable and secure STOP 
START the UNK of the past had died away and the great UNK which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to UNK men's minds STOP 
START throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm severe UNK displays itself STOP 
START in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or UNK one in its internal UNK but the best of the geometric UNK have UNK been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the greek world STOP 
START the ninth century was in its artistic work the UNK UNK and most UNK between past and future and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a UNK to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated STOP 
START the aegean in 800 b.c. geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it deserves partly because the task is a UNK one and partly because some of its local UNK as at UNK are only now coming to light STOP 
START from even a UNK inspection of its many aspects however the historian can UNK several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 b.c. STOP 
START the general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the UNK century was now UNK to a significant degree STOP 
START much which was in UNK in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 STOP 
START in this process the UNK UNK had been UNK or finally rejected aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 STOP 
START those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from earliest times granted occasional UNK of peoples and ideas from outside are correct all too many observers have been UNK by this fact into UNK the degree of change which took place in the early first UNK STOP 
START the focus of UNK in this world now lay in the UNK districts of the greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire aegean always UNK its northern UNK had accepted the geometric style of pottery STOP 
START while UNK vases usually turn up especially outside greece proper together with as many or more examples of local UNK these UNK patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century STOP 
START in their place came local variations within the common style tentative as it were in UNK products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed STOP 
START UNK though important was not the only teacher of this age STOP 
START one can take a UNK of about 800 b.c. and without any knowledge of its place of origin venture to assign it to a specific area and UNK of UNK now become UNK STOP 
START the UNK of the aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in greece itself UNK UNK attic UNK and other geometric UNK have each their own UNK STOP 
START these local variations were to become ever UNK in the next century and a half STOP 
START the same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark ages from UNK distribution and from the UNK of early social political and religious patterns into later ages STOP 
START by 800 b.c. the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture STOP 
START on these UNK rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be UNK in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad STOP 
START everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local diversity history and culture were UNK UNK and UNK by the UNK of these UNK yet opposed factors STOP 
START further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their name STOP 
START many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently UNK to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a UNK structure STOP 
START the epic poems the UNK of the greek UNK the rise of firm political units the UNK which could permit painted and UNK UNK of men all these had to UNK the progress of following decades STOP 
START what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and yet the results however general are worth the search STOP 
START these are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the UNK outlook independent of outside forces STOP 
START to interpret indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of UNK may be a necessary but unfortunate UNK born of our lack of detailed information we could see more deeply we probably would find many side issues and wrong UNK which came to an end within the period STOP 
START the historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that future UNK will UNK our understanding STOP 
START throughout the dark ages it is clear the greek world had been developing slowly but consistently STOP 
START the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants of the aegean stood on firm ground STOP 
START chapter 5 the early eighth century the landscape of greek history UNK widely and rather abruptly in the eighth century b.c. the age of UNK UNK dawn STOP 
START the first UNK UNK of the new day cannot yet UNK all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more UNK some of the lines of change STOP 
START for this period as for earlier centuries pottery remains the most secure source UNK material of the age is more UNK more UNK and more UNK of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of human life and death STOP 
START UNK and simple UNK UNK the UNK of sculpture and architecture in greece in gold ivory and bronze grow more numerous STOP 
START since writing was UNK in the aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful STOP 
START though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken UNK shape by UNK STOP 
START the UNK geometric pottery of UNK and the iliad are amazing UNK of the inherent UNK of greek civilization both were among the last products of a phase which was ending STOP 
START greek civilization was UNK toward its great revolution in which the developed qualities of the UNK outlook were suddenly to break forth STOP 
START the revolution was well under way before UNK b.c. and UNK signs go back virtually across the century STOP 
START the era however is UNK STOP 
START while many UNK point forward the main achievements stand as a UNK of the simple patterns of the dark ages STOP 
START the dominant pottery of the century was geometric organization UNK about the UNK was just beginning to expand gods who protected the greek UNK were only now putting on their sharply UNK dress STOP 
START the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century STOP 
START not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis STOP 
START many UNK clung to the past the more UNK as they were confronted with radically new ideas poet of the iliad deliberately UNK STOP 
START although it is not possible to UNK old and new in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an UNK of the first stage of greek civilization STOP 
START on this principle of division i must UNK the evolution of sculpture architecture society and politics the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself STOP 
START the growing contacts between aegean and UNK are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable UNK of UNK culture after UNK STOP 
START we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece important point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those of later decades were only incidentally influenced by oriental models STOP 
START the UNK of UNK vases and of the iliad lie in the aegean past STOP 
START UNK pottery the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric STOP 
START the severe yet UNK vases of the previous fifty years the strong geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a UNK of the principles underlying geometric pottery artists now were ready to UNK and elaborate their UNK STOP 
START the vases which resulted had different shapes far more complex UNK and a larger sense of style STOP 
START beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines STOP 
START in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in UNK a fundamental sense of order after chaos STOP 
START they had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give UNK to impulses STOP 
START the UNK in particular had virtually UNK UNK drawing elaborate UNK and the UNK lines of nature while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe STOP 
START in their vases were UNK the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization at first UNK in UNK work and then more UNK in the initial stages of the geometric style STOP 
START by 800 social and cultural security had been achieved at least on a simple plane was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments STOP 
START ripe geometric UNK continued to employ the old UNK of UNK and shapes and made use of the UNK though limited range of UNK which they had inherited STOP 
START in these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a UNK of earlier lines of progress STOP 
START to the UNK UNK however new materials were added STOP 
START painters left less and less of a UNK in a plain dark color they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by UNK patterns into which UNK drawing began to UNK STOP 
START UNK lines UNK patterns UNK of UNK UNK nature birds either UNK or in UNK rows animals in solemn frieze bands see plates 11 12 all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the UNK were UNK their gaze STOP 
START the rows of animals and birds in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal UNK UNK perhaps via UNK silver UNK and textiles but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are UNK greek STOP 
START though the spread of this type of UNK in the aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first in the UNK which were among the leading UNK of pottery throughout the century STOP 
START as the material at the command of the UNK grew and the volume of their production increased the local variations within a common style became more evident STOP 
START plate 12 UNK four examples which are ripe or late geometric work of common spirit but of different schools STOP

START in the period since the end of world war 2 a period UNK with UNK demands for the colorful the unusual and the original in signs and displays plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field STOP 
START the importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry however is not in terms of volume alone STOP 
START designers of signs and displays have shown a UNK approach to the UNK of plastics that has influenced the UNK of other industries STOP 
START many of today's developments in UNK stem from original work done with signs and displays art of UNK in UNK was similarly UNK by the sign makers the UNK UNK techniques now used for UNK UNK etc. UNK much to the field as does the technology of UNK with the UNK properties of the transparent plastics STOP 
START there is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below STOP 
START the concept of UNK as shown by the UNK on p. UNK as just one example offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems no matter what industry is involved STOP 
START a volume market according to a recent wall street journal survey plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales STOP 
START five years ago they had only UNK of the market with the remainder firmly UNK in the UNK of neon UNK STOP 
START and it's far from the end for plastics STOP 
START industry sources are now UNK that UNK of the signs made during the UNK will be of plastic construction STOP 
START evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as advance neon sign co. los angeles calif. STOP 
START four years ago the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs UNK is in plastics STOP 
START from the volume standpoint the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive STOP 
START UNK sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million STOP 
START currently there are some UNK companies in the field ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal electrical and plastic components STOP 
START why the trend to plastics accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field of many factors which might be cited five are most important 1 STOP 
START plastics combine such properties as UNK color light weight UNK UNK or UNK resistance to UNK as well as the ease of UNK STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START plastic signs are economical STOP 
START according to one major producer materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately UNK less costly than for a comparable neon unit STOP 
START shipping cost is also reduced UNK plastic sign UNK about UNK lb. compared to UNK lb. for neon STOP 
START the weight advantage plus greater UNK of the plastic unit UNK a saving of about UNK in shipping STOP 
START the lighter weight also means less costly supports and UNK are needed STOP 
START finally maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on UNK neon signs STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START they offer exceptional design freedom making it possible to UNK contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer STOP 
START UNK and UNK sheet plastics fill the gap between UNK and molded plastics STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK and the freedom to form large and small thick and thin materials make plastics UNK for the industry STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START plastic signs work around the clock STOP 
START internal UNK protected from the elements gives them powerful visual appeal at night daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START advances in equipment and UNK techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques ranging from UNK molding for UNK UNK UNK signs generally UNK units is the minimum to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs STOP 
START among the newest UNK methods to enter the display field are UNK UNK molding and blow molding STOP 
START what plastics to use outdoor signs and displays acrylic with its outstanding optical characteristics weather resistance and UNK strongly UNK the picture STOP 
START at present both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer UNK sheets are being used by sign manufacturers with UNK now representing an estimated UNK of the total STOP 
START see panel p. UNK for a comparison STOP 
START of interest is a recent announcement by du pont's UNK UNK of a new UNK UNK UNK designated as UNK h 100 which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry STOP 
START UNK cast from this material UNK UNK only one-third as much as glass is UNK to all kinds of weather and will not yellow STOP 
START its high impact strength even at low temperatures UNK UNK cracking and UNK according to du pont STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK is used UNK for UNK signs background panels and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional UNK ease of forming and excellent UNK properties STOP 
START its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors STOP 
START new to the field is a UNK type UNK UNK in which the two sheets of the UNK are of different color STOP 
START UNK the UNK and then UNK away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a UNK sign STOP 
START see UNK UNK 1961 p. UNK STOP 
START for specialized types of displays such as large UNK units UNK a product package human or animal figures etc. UNK plastics and UNK molded UNK UNK are other materials frequently used STOP 
START a relative UNK in outdoor signs is UNK UNK film now used as a printed UNK for UNK signs see below STOP 
START for outdoor signs and displays where the problem of UNK resistance is no longer a factor the choice of plastics is almost unlimited STOP 
START here may be found regular and impact UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK acrylic UNK UNK UNK foam and UNK STOP 
START the final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs method of UNK degree of complexity number of units required time available for UNK and projected life UNK of the unit STOP 
START often the finished sign or display UNK several types of plastics and two or more UNK techniques STOP 
START UNK UNK one of the most significant UNK in design of plastics signs is the so-called UNK UNK now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as advance neon sign co. los angeles and industrial electric inc. new orleans UNK STOP 
START the essential difference between the new UNK boards and existing UNK is that the former constructed of UNK plastic panels are lighted from within STOP 
START with the source of light behind the copy there is no loss of UNK output as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light STOP 
START also the light sources are UNK from dirt and weather exposure and cannot UNK the view of the sign STOP 
START the copy itself including any text or illustrations is UNK in full color directly on a thin UNK UNK film by a UNK screen process STOP 
START the film has an UNK on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required STOP 
START spare sets of face panels UNK the change from one copy or message to another panels are UNK for the old right in the field on a single trip STOP 
START panels with UNK copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied STOP 
START signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities and others are on the way STOP 
START it is believed that these boards will within the next few years replace many of the conventional UNK boards now in use STOP 
START UNK signs also show UNK in other directions STOP 
START as used by industrial electric inc. the film panels are printed one at a time as are UNK UNK STOP 
START thus the film can be applied to UNK UNK plastics faces can also be applied to UNK panels for use on UNK or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces STOP 
START in this way the sign maker has an economical means for UNK uniform copy on different sign media STOP 
START recently industrial electric UNK another new development made possible by modern plastic materials a UNK spectacular sign STOP 
START UNK of 16 UNK UNK plastic sections it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit STOP 
START the UNK automatically UNK in a cycle which permits 9 sec. of UNK time for each UNK subject STOP 
START sixteen panels each slightly more than UNK UNK wide make up the UNK length of the sign STOP 
START UNK letters fill many needs perhaps the best way to indicate the UNK of design that UNK the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field UNK signs STOP 
START signs are meant to convey a message and in most cases this requires words and letters STOP 
START frequently the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products price changes etc. STOP 
START the huge market for UNK signs has UNK a universal demand for individual plastic letters in all shapes and sizes and a number of companies are set up to supply them STOP 
START here are some of the newer items currently available UNK products inc. chicago ill. a UNK copy and display sign which consists of an UNK impact UNK background in choice of colors onto which are mounted UNK letters figures or words UNK on UNK or other types of sheet stock STOP 
START the background which is available in various UNK and continuous lengths is UNK with parallel UNK UNK which grip the flexible letters UNK STOP 
START the UNK co. UNK UNK letters molded of UNK available in several sizes in either red or black STOP 
START ideal for UNK use they are UNK and have mounting UNK on the back which fit into UNK in a UNK UNK background panel STOP 
START for large letters e.g. UNK of acrylic or UNK there are other techniques STOP 
START for example in a typical store installation fifty UNK and six UNK red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background STOP 
START the fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle UNK UNK to the letters STOP 
START UNK steel UNK were used to minimize UNK UNK STOP 
START for mounting to UNK plastic UNK very small holes may be UNK in the sides of the letters and UNK steel wire UNK through the UNK its ends twisted behind the panels STOP 
START large UNK letters are also available for sign installations STOP 
START wagner sign service inc. chicago for example supplies them in several colors in heights of 4 6 8 10 and 17 inches STOP 
START they are molded of a special UNK formulation of UNK UNK STOP 
START also available from this company are UNK UNK UNK of transparent acrylic material which may be UNK to any UNK acrylic background material STOP 
START made in lengths from 3 to 10 UNK the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the UNK UNK molded in back of the letters STOP 
START still another approach to the UNK letter type of sign is a UNK unit introduced by UNK products UNK calif. STOP 
START this vacuum formed sign is UNK of UNK or smaller panels formed of UNK clear UNK sheet stock UNK and UNK on the rear side STOP 
START finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of UNK aluminum which may be mounted to various surfaces STOP 
START the sheets are UNK of UNK UNK by jet UNK co. los angeles calif. STOP 
START on UNK units where additional structural requirements are imposed one recent approach UNK UNK UNK or formed channels e.g. UNK UNK of the acrylic or UNK STOP 
START joined side by side such channels make possible construction of continuous UNK luminous areas up to 50 UNK high and of unlimited width STOP 
START letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels painted on the first surface or handled in other ways STOP

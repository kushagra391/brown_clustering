START she says she has to finish a story STOP 
START he shrugged STOP 
START i asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow but it seems the UNK is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go STOP 
START casey made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man STOP 
START his name was george UNK and he too had come from a good family STOP 
START he was perhaps UNK UNK set up with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave STOP 
START he was always well UNK and well UNK and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good UNK schools and a proper university STOP 
START an only child he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father UNK him by dying broke STOP 
START since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main interest was gambling STOP 
START all this went through UNK mind in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all STOP 
START for he had understood that UNK had been engaged to a boy named UNK UNK STOP 
START she had grown up with young UNK and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice STOP 
START he wanted to ask her about UNK now but he knew he couldn't do so in UNK presence STOP 
START and so still wondering and a little UNK he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was UNK STOP 
START where did you pick him up oh i've known him quite a while STOP 
START she glanced at her companion UNK STOP 
START haven't i george i've been after her for years UNK said but i've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days STOP 
START the UNK eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched UNK hand STOP 
START can i tell you a secret going to get married STOP 
START do you approve kept his smile fixed but some small inner UNK was working on him as he thought again about UNK who was eight or ten years older than the girl STOP 
START he wondered whether UNK was going to UNK off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from UNK estate to UNK him STOP 
START none of this showed in his face and he tried to keep his UNK in hand STOP 
START he made a point of frowning of acting out the part of the fond UNK STOP 
START i'll have to give it some thought he said STOP 
START you wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would you made a face at him and then she laughed STOP 
START of course not STOP 
START i'll get my references in order UNK said and though he spoke with a smile casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly UNK STOP 
START stop by any time casey STOP 
START he stood up and touched the UNK arm STOP 
START come on darling STOP 
START if you're really serious about working on that story i'd better take you home STOP 
START casey watched them go still frowning UNK and then UNK the matter as he called for his check STOP 
START as he went out he told UNK the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat and coat from UNK parks and put a UNK piece in the UNK he told her to be sure that it went toward her UNK STOP 
START a taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment STOP 
START because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry UNK car was still there STOP 
START in fact he did not think about jerry burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him STOP 
START only then when his glance focused on the UNK and saw that it was empty did he remember his earlier problem STOP 
START even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over burton the UNK the sheet of paper on top of it STOP 
START then he was UNK across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note STOP 
START jack look in the UNK STOP 
START i knew the only way i could beat you was to play UNK but it was a good try kid and i appreciate it STOP 
START the UNK stood near the wall next to the UNK and the instant casey picked it up he knew what had happened STOP 
START the UNK papers inside were UNK there was a UNK of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct STOP 
START he put the basket down UNK UNK softly and thoroughly UNK with himself and his plan that had seemed so UNK STOP 
START for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get UNK drinks for himself STOP 
START for another second or two he gave in to the UNK that was directed at himself his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious and as the thought expanded the implications UNK him STOP 
START it no longer UNK that burton had UNK him STOP 
START the important thing was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a UNK with a gun in his pocket STOP 
START and that gun was empty STOP 
START even before his mind had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his UNK pocket and pulled out the six UNK he had taken from the revolver STOP 
START he considered them with brooding eyes UNK UNK as his brain UNK with the problem and tried to find some solution STOP 
START he said the crazy fool half aloud STOP 
START he put the shells on the table as though he could no longer bear to hold them STOP 
START he thought where the hell could he have gone can i find him was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his imagination out of control STOP 
START he tried to tell himself that maybe burton had UNK up enough to get some sense STOP 
START maybe he only intended to UNK the UNK whoever he was in which case an UNK gun would be good enough STOP 
START he thought of other possibilities none of them satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was some way he could reach burton STOP 
START then as he turned toward the telephone it rang UNK to UNK the UNK in the room and he reached for it eagerly STOP 
START yeah he said STOP 
START casey yeah STOP 
START tony UNK STOP 
START casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to make the mental UNK and control the UNK inside his head STOP 
START when he heard UNK say what about that picture you took this afternoon still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for frank UNK STOP 
START what picture demanded STOP 
START you took a picture of me at the corner of washington and UNK about three thirty this afternoon STOP 
START who says so one of my boys STOP 
START casey believed that much STOP 
START UNK was not the sort who walked around without one of his boys close at hand STOP 
START so with my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that picture published STOP 
START who says it's going to be published i wouldn't even want it to get around STOP 
START under normal circumstances casey was a little UNK when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken STOP 
START even so he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who UNK their objections properly STOP 
START right now however he was still too worried about jerry burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told him to care too much about tony UNK STOP 
START his nerves were getting a little UNK and his UNK put an edge in his voice STOP 
START look he said STOP 
START i was hired to take a picture STOP 
START i took it STOP 
START that's all i know about it and that's all i care STOP 
START maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said STOP 
START you tell him STOP 
START all right UNK said his voice still quiet STOP 
START but i meant what i said casey STOP 
START if that picture gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it i'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you STOP 
START you do that casey said STOP 
START just be sure to send your two best boys tony STOP 
START he hung up with a UNK UNK at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create STOP 
START as soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone UNK and found jerry UNK home number STOP 
START he UNK it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up STOP 
START he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton up that afternoon STOP 
START when he was told that no one had seen burton since then he thought of three other places that were possibilities STOP 
START each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up STOP 
START by the time he had UNK three cigarettes he had UNK down STOP 
START he had done all he could and that was that STOP 
START and anyway burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk STOP 
START he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible STOP 
START he should have stayed here and watched burton STOP 
START he didn't STOP 
START so he made a mistake STOP 
START so what kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink STOP 
START only then did he decide he didn't want one STOP 
START he considered opening a can of beer but UNK that idea too STOP 
START finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes STOP 
START he had just finished UNK the right one when the telephone rang again STOP 
START when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent STOP 
START casey don't know me but i know you STOP 
START if you want a picture get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can STOP 
START if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys STOP 
START casey heard the UNK of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision STOP 
START for over the years he had received many such calls STOP 
START some of them came from people who identified themselves STOP 
START some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past STOP 
START others because they expected some sort of reward for the information STOP 
START a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break STOP 
START only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not UNK this time STOP 
START he was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue STOP 
START it was a district of small factories and UNK buildings and occasional UNK and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the UNK STOP 
START he did not bother with his radio there would be time for that later but as he UNK out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone UNK and knew instantly how he had been UNK STOP 
START the police car had pulled up behind a small UNK its UNK still on STOP

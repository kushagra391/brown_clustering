START there were UNK patients on the bus the morning i left for hanover most of them disturbed and UNK STOP 
START an UNK a nurse and two UNK were in charge of us STOP 
START i felt lonely and depressed as i stared out the bus window at UNK grim dirty west side STOP 
START it seemed incredible as i listened to the UNK UNK of voices and smelled the UNK UNK coming from the patients that UNK i was a ward of the state of illinois going to a hospital for the mentally ill STOP 
START i suddenly thought of mary jane UNK the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet competence the UNK and UNK that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses STOP 
START we had become good friends during my stay at cook county hospital STOP 
START i had told her enough about myself to UNK somewhat the UNK stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in marshall field co. STOP 
START she knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies STOP 
START she knew also that i was UNK and without a single known relative STOP 
START she wasn't quite sure that i felt enough UNK about my drinking or that i would not return to it once i was out and on my own again STOP 
START this had worried her STOP 
START i read those newspaper stories about you she had said STOP 
START you must have loved that girl very much but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her STOP 
START why do you say that asked STOP 
START i was full of UNK and well a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll do STOP 
START nonsense grew up in an irish neighborhood on UNK west side STOP 
START don't tell me about UNK STOP 
START you're not the kind to go violent STOP 
START were you in love with that girl would it make any difference to you if i were mary jane met my eyes suddenly angry STOP 
START i wouldn't have gone into nursing if i didn't care about people STOP 
START i'm interested in every patient i've helped take care of STOP 
START when i think of people like you well i you what mary jane you are young intelligent have a whole UNK before you to make something worth while of yourself but you mess it up with whiskey indifference UNK attitudes STOP 
START i don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you STOP 
START was she pretty oh yes i said feeling UNK she was very pretty STOP 
START you don't believe that i'm going back to medical school and finish do you why should i worked this ward for three months now STOP 
START we keep getting the same ones back again and again STOP 
START they all mean well have great promises to make when they are about to go home but drinking is their UNK STOP 
START you've not seemed like them but maybe you are STOP 
START you've treated your stay here like a big joke STOP 
START it's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to hanover STOP 
START i wanted to go to college too why didn't you asked STOP 
START chicago has some of the best her eyes flashed UNK STOP 
START that's what i mean about you anderson she said STOP 
START you don't seem to know much about reality STOP 
START i'll tell you why i didn't go to college the oldest of six children STOP 
START my father's a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year STOP 
START there was no money for UNK for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted STOP 
START UNK training here doesn't cost anything STOP 
START they even pay me six dollars a month STOP 
START i think it's a good deal STOP 
START i'm going to become a good nurse and i've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if i have to work at my profession until i'm an old maid to give it to them STOP 
START do you have a boy friend asked STOP 
START that's none of your business she said then changed the subject STOP 
START what about your father and mother don't you think of them when you're in a place like this my father and mother died when i was two years old i said STOP 
START my aunt raised me STOP 
START aunt mary died when i was doing my military service STOP 
START i have no one but myself to worry about STOP 
START something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face STOP 
START i'm sorry she said STOP 
START i don't know what i'd do without my family STOP 
START we've always been so close STOP 
START tell me more about them STOP 
START her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START listening i felt UNK and lonely as only an UNK can STOP 
START when she had finished i said your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman STOP 
START i'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a UNK like me were to ask his daughter for a date i mean after i'm out of the hospital a month or so from now STOP 
START my father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to UNK for five years STOP 
START he's a pretty good judge of character anderson STOP 
START i don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a UNK in the future STOP 
START what about you would you feel about it if i were to ask you for a date when i get through at hanover if i thought you were serious about going back to school that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at hanover well i might consider such an offer STOP 
START what about your that girl you were going to kill suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane UNK should know the truth about me that i was not the confused sick UNK person she believed me to be STOP 
START there are things about me that i can't tell you now mary jane i said but if you'll go out to dinner with me when i get out of hanover i'd like to tell you the whole story STOP 
START i can say this i'm dead serious about going back to school STOP 
START as for that other girl let's just say that i never want to see her again STOP 
START you will get to come home on long UNK from hanover won't you yes i'll get one overnight a month STOP 
START we'll go up to the UNK beach hotel for dinner i said STOP 
START do you like to dance always have a good orchestra STOP 
START i like to dance she said then turned and walked away STOP 
START there hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me STOP 
START i knew that STOP 
START it was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there STOP 
START now riding this hospital bus feeling isolated and utterly alone i knew that she was genuine and unique quite unlike any girl i had known before STOP 
START it seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me STOP 
START it was a fantastic story STOP 
START only two people in the state of illinois knew that i was entering hanover state hospital under an assumed name or why STOP 
START it was unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary jane UNK would believe it without proof STOP 
START but i had the proof all UNK in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free to do so STOP 
START as the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in order STOP 
START i wondered suddenly as i listened to the UNK UNK coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined it all STOP 
START perhaps this was reality and UNK nelson the actor was UNK UNK of carl UNK imagination STOP 
START four i had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic production called ask tony STOP 
START it was a bad play real UNK UNK which only a UNK of angels with UNK dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into UNK STOP 
START no one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway STOP 
START but because it was a UNK UNK story of the UNK era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue as a road company and eventually become a movie STOP 
START such optimism was completely UNK STOP 
START the critics literally screamed their UNK STOP 
START ask tony was UNK from the moment UNK leveled on it in his UNK column STOP 
START we opened on friday and closed the following monday STOP 
START out of the entire cast i alone received good UNK for my UNK of a UNK killer STOP 
START this let me in for a lot of UNK from the rest of the company two members of which were native UNK STOP 
START we were paid off tuesday morning and given tickets back to new york STOP 
START i felt lonely and depressed as i packed my UNK at the UNK hotel STOP 
START it seemed to me that my life was UNK to be one brilliant failure after another STOP 
START i had been among the top third in my class at UNK had wanted desperately to go to medical school but i'd run out of money and energy at the same time STOP 
START then later i had quit my safe secure UNK spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play STOP 
START it seemed to me that i was not only UNK but quite stupid as well STOP 
START i knew that i'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a UNK at union news or UNK while waiting for another acting job to open STOP 
START it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life STOP 
START i closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the UNK to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water STOP 
START the telephone rang STOP 
START when i answered it a voice too UNK and british to be real said is this mr. UNK nelson the actor all right i said STOP 
START why don't you bastards lay off for a while i beg your UNK sir all right STOP 
START this is UNK nelson the actor STOP 
START good STOP 
START i'm calling you mr. nelson at the request of mr. UNK UNK STOP 
START could you possibly have lunch with him today car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve STOP 
START i smiled STOP 
START you'll send the UNK of course yes of course mr. nelson STOP 
START i started to say something else appropriate but the man had hung up STOP 
START i finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were UNK their UNK over the UNK passing of ask tony STOP 
START they all UNK low as i approached them STOP 
START all right you bastards i said the great actor is about to buy a drink STOP 
START i laid a UNK on the bar and UNK to the UNK to serve a round STOP 
START he had just returned my change when the UNK came in off the street to page me STOP 
START i walked over to him STOP 
START you mr. nelson asked STOP 
START that's right STOP 
START mr. UNK car is waiting for you at the east entrance STOP 
START i followed him out through the lobby to the street STOP 
START an ancient UNK as UNK impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb STOP 
START the elderly UNK UNK in a dark uniform stood UNK at attention holding open the door of the town car STOP

START the expense and time involved are UNK STOP 
START however we sent a third vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two STOP 
START we have learned much about UNK UNK since a hundred years ago is all i can tell you about them STOP 
START but the third ship came back several years ago and reported that it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already UNK by UNK beings hal UNK in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak STOP 
START UNK stopped UNK to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes STOP 
START how did you know said sharply STOP 
START forgive me UNK said hal STOP 
START but it was inevitable not the UNK UNK in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found believe it was on page UNK smiled and said i am glad that your UNK lessons have left such an impression STOP 
START how could they not hal STOP 
START besides they were not the only impressions STOP 
START i still bear UNK on my back where UNK my UNK whipped me because i had not learned my lessons well enough STOP 
START he was a good UNK that UNK STOP 
START was i grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was STOP 
START he was my UNK in the UNK STOP 
START he was the UNK UNK when i went to college and thought i was getting away from him STOP 
START he is now my block UNK STOP 
START he is the one responsible for my getting such low m. UNK STOP 
START swiftly came the UNK the protest STOP 
START no not he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me STOP 
START if i get a low m. r. i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does STOP 
START if i die i die because i UNK it so STOP 
START so forgive me UNK for the UNK thoughts please UNK me again UNK said hal STOP 
START but did the expedition find any records of the UNK having been on this planet even though this is too much to wish find the UNK himself no said UNK STOP 
START though that does not mean that there may not be such records there STOP 
START the expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to earth STOP 
START i can't tell you now the distance in UNK or what star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere STOP 
START if you UNK you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves STOP 
START and it leaves very soon STOP 
START you need a linguist hal STOP 
START the ship is huge said UNK but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one STOP 
START we have considered several of your UNK because they were UNK and above suspicion STOP 
START unfortunately hal waited UNK paced some more frowning STOP 
START then he said unfortunately only one UNK linguist exists and he is too old for this expedition STOP 
START therefore a thousand UNK said hal STOP 
START but i have just thought of one thing STOP 
START i am married STOP 
START no problem at all said UNK STOP 
START there will be no women aboard the gabriel STOP 
START and if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce STOP 
START hal UNK and he said a divorce raised his hands UNK and said you are UNK of course STOP 
START but from our reading of the western UNK we UNK believe that the UNK knowing this situation would arise made reference to and provision for divorce STOP 
START it's inevitable in this case for the couple will be separated for at the least forty years STOP 
START naturally he UNK the provision in obscure language STOP 
START in his great and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the UNK must not be able to read UNK what we planned STOP 
START i UNK said hal STOP 
START tell me more UNK STOP 
START six months later hal UNK stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and watched the ball of earth UNK above him STOP 
START it was night on this hemisphere but the light UNK from the UNK of australia japan china southeast asia india UNK STOP 
START hal the linguist saw the UNK UNK and UNK in terms of the languages spoken UNK STOP 
START australia the UNK islands japan and northern china were UNK by those members of the UNK union that spoke american STOP 
START southern china all of southeast asia southern india and UNK these states of the UNK federation spoke UNK STOP 
START UNK spoke UNK STOP 
START his mind turned the globe swiftly for him and he UNK africa which used UNK south of the UNK sea STOP 
START all around the UNK sea asia minor northern india and UNK UNK was the native tongue STOP 
START in southern europe between the UNK UNK and the UNK peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory called march STOP 
START this was no man's land UNK by the UNK union and the UNK republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred years STOP 
START neither nation would give up their claim on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second UNK war STOP 
START so for all practical purposes it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government UNK outside its own borders STOP 
START its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving UNK plus a new one called UNK a UNK whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose UNK was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper STOP 
START hal saw in his mind the rest of earth UNK UNK the UNK islands and the eastern half of south america STOP 
START here the peoples spoke the tongue of UNK because that island had gotten the jump on the UNK who were busy UNK north america and the western half of south america after the UNK war STOP 
START then there was north america where american was the native speech of all except the twenty UNK of UNK living on the hudson bay preserve STOP 
START hal knew that when that side of earth UNK into the night zone UNK city would UNK out into space STOP 
START and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment STOP 
START but mary would soon no longer be living there for she would be UNK in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to UNK STOP 
START she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him in her UNK way though in public she would be UNK STOP 
START her friends and professional associates would UNK with her not because she had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man who thought UNK STOP 
START if hal UNK had been killed in a crash he must have wanted it that way STOP 
START there was no such thing as an accident STOP 
START somehow all the other passengers also supposed to have died in this UNK of elaborate UNK to cover up the UNK of the personnel of the gabriel had simultaneously agreed to die STOP 
START and therefore being in UNK they would not be UNK and their UNK flung to the winds in public ceremony STOP 
START no the fish could eat their bodies for all the UNK cared STOP 
START hal felt sorry for mary had a time keeping the tears from UNK to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome STOP 
START yet he told himself this was the best way STOP 
START he and mary would no longer have to tear and UNK at each other mutual UNK would be over STOP 
START mary was free to marry again not knowing that the UNK had UNK given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her marriage STOP 
START she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list selected by her UNK STOP 
START perhaps the psychological barriers that had prevented her from UNK UNK child would no longer be present STOP 
START perhaps STOP 
START hal UNK if this happy event would occur STOP 
START mary was as frozen below the UNK as he STOP 
START no matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the UNK the UNK STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START he would no longer have to see that fat face hear that UNK voice hal UNK the UNK voice STOP 
START and slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned STOP 
START there was the UNK UNK man smiling UNK up at him STOP 
START my beloved ward my UNK UNK said the UNK voice STOP 
START i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage STOP 
START but i might have known seem to be bound by love himself must have UNK it STOP 
START love to you my ward STOP 
START UNK love you too my UNK said hal UNK STOP 
START how wonderful to see your cherished self STOP 
START i had thought we would never again speak to each other STOP 
START 5 the gabriel pointed towards her UNK and under UNK acceleration began to build up towards her ultimate velocity UNK percent of the speed of light STOP 
START meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship went into the UNK STOP 
START here they would lie in suspended UNK for many years STOP 
START some time later after a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others STOP 
START they would sleep while the UNK drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the UNK bodies of the personnel could not have endured STOP 
START upon reaching the desired speed the automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty vessel would UNK towards the star which was its UNK end STOP 
START many years later the UNK apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to UNK UNK STOP 
START again a force too strong for UNK bodies to UNK would be applied STOP 
START then after UNK the vessel considerably the drive would adjust to a UNK UNK STOP 
START and the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended UNK STOP 
START these members would then UNK the rest of the personnel STOP 
START and in the UNK left before reaching their UNK the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed STOP 
START hal UNK was among the last to go into the UNK and among the first to come out STOP 
START he had to study the UNK of the language of the chief nation of UNK UNK STOP 
START and from the first he faced a difficult task STOP 
START the expedition that had discovered UNK had succeeded in UNK two thousand UNK words with an equal number of american words STOP 
START the description of the UNK UNK was very restricted STOP 
START and as hal found out obviously mistaken in many cases STOP 
START this discovery caused hal anxiety STOP 
START his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak UNK STOP 
START yet if he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be UNK his students UNK STOP 
START moreover even getting this across would be difficult STOP 
START for one thing the organs of speech of the UNK natives differed somewhat from UNK sounds made by these organs were therefore UNK STOP 
START it was true that they could be UNK but would the UNK understand these UNK UNK was the UNK construction of UNK STOP 
START consider the tense system STOP 
START instead of UNK a UNK or using an UNK particle to indicate the past or future UNK used an entirely different word STOP 
START thus the UNK UNK UNK UNK meaning to live was in the perfect tense UNK and in the future UNK STOP 
START the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other UNK STOP 
START plus the fact that UNK not only had the normal to UNK three UNK of UNK UNK and UNK but the two extra of UNK and spiritual STOP 
START fortunately UNK was UNK though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in UNK STOP 
START the system of indicating UNK varied according to tense STOP 
START all the other parts of speech UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK operated under the same system as the UNK STOP

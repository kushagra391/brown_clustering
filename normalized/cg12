START nothing like UNK he arrived before the hour STOP 
START his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday and i came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve STOP 
START he was waiting STOP 
START my wish to meet samuel UNK had been UNK by simple curiosity and interest in his work STOP 
START american newspaper UNK like to call his plays UNK STOP 
START they find deep UNK in them STOP 
START even so UNK a UNK as harold UNK of the nation has said that waiting for UNK is the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair STOP 
START but to me UNK writing had seemed UNK with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that i could UNK neither with despair nor with UNK STOP 
START could it be that my own eyes and ears had UNK me his a literature of defeat irrelevant to the social crises we face is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions because a man is not the same as his writing in the last analysis the questions had to be settled by the work itself STOP 
START nevertheless i was curious STOP 
START my curiosity was UNK a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a UNK teacher of literature a UNK father at a conference on religious drama near paris STOP 
START when UNK name came into the discussion the priest grew loud and told me that UNK UNK life STOP 
START that i thought is at least one thing i can find out when we meet STOP 
START UNK appearance is UNK irish STOP 
START the features of his face are distinct but not fine STOP 
START they look as if they had been UNK with an UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK hair goes straight up from his forehead standing so high that the top falls gently over as if to show that it really is hair and not UNK STOP 
START one might say it UNK the man pride and UNK STOP 
START for he has the pride that comes of UNK and the UNK perhaps of the same UNK not to UNK himself upon another STOP 
START his light blue eyes set deep within the face are actively and continually looking STOP 
START he seems by some unconscious division of labor to have given them that one function and no other leaving communication to the rest of the face STOP 
START the mouth frequently breaks into a UNK smile STOP 
START the voice is light in UNK with a rough edge that UNK to his UNK STOP 
START the irish UNK is as one would expect combined with slight UNK from the french STOP 
START his UNK suit was a UNK gray and green STOP 
START he wore a brown UNK sports shirt with no tie STOP 
START we walked down the UNK de UNK UNK along beside the UNK and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church STOP 
START the conversation that UNK may have been UNK but it could hardly be called UNK STOP 
START for one thing the world that UNK sees is already shattered STOP 
START his talk turns to what he calls the mess or sometimes this UNK confusion STOP 
START i UNK his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation STOP 
START what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words STOP 
START the confusion is not my invention STOP 
START we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being UNK aware of the confusion STOP 
START it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in STOP 
START the only chance of UNK is to open our eyes and see the mess STOP 
START it is not a mess you can make sense of STOP 
START i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth but UNK did not take to the word truth STOP 
START what is more true than anything else swim is true and to sink is true STOP 
START one is not more true than the other STOP 
START one cannot speak UNK of being one must speak only of the mess STOP 
START when UNK and UNK speak of a contrast between being and existence they may be right i don't know but their language is too philosophical for me STOP 
START i am not a philosopher STOP 
START one can only speak of what is in front of him and that now is simply the mess STOP 
START then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form STOP 
START until recently art has UNK the pressure of UNK things STOP 
START it has held them at bay STOP 
START it realized that to admit them was to UNK form STOP 
START how could the mess be admitted because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be now we can keep it out no longer because we have come into a time when it UNK our experience at every moment STOP 
START it is there and it must be allowed in STOP 
START i granted this might be so but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously STOP 
START and why not i asked could chaos be admitted to chaos not that be the end of thinking and the end of art we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form STOP 
START UNK own work is an example STOP 
START plays more highly UNK than waiting for UNK UNK and UNK last tape would be hard to find STOP 
START what i am saying does not mean that there will UNK be no form in art STOP 
START it only means that there will be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it UNK the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else STOP 
START the form and the chaos remain separate STOP 
START the latter is not reduced to the former STOP 
START that is why the form itself becomes a UNK because it exists as a problem separate from the material it UNK STOP 
START to find a form that UNK the mess that is the task of the artist now STOP 
START yet i responded could not similar things be said about the art of the past it not characteristic of the greatest art that it UNK us with something we cannot clarify demanding that the UNK respond to it in his own UNK way is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory all art ambiguous not this he said and UNK toward the UNK STOP 
START the classical lines of the church which UNK thought of as a temple of glory dominated all the scene where we sat STOP 
START the boulevard de la UNK the boulevard UNK and the UNK UNK ran to it with UNK UNK bearing UNK of the age of reason STOP 
START not this STOP 
START this is clear STOP 
START this does not allow the mystery to UNK us STOP 
START with classical art all is settled STOP 
START but it is different at UNK STOP 
START there is the UNK and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer STOP 
START i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays STOP 
START UNK and UNK UNK on the edge of suicide world is death and UNK may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside STOP 
START is this UNK question a part of the chaos yes STOP 
START if life and death did not both present themselves to us there would be no UNK STOP 
START if there were only darkness all would be clear STOP 
START it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes UNK STOP 
START take UNK doctrine of grace given and grace UNK have you UNK the dramatic qualities in this theology UNK are UNK with christ one saved and the other damned STOP 
START how can we make sense of this division classical drama such problems do not arise STOP 
START the destiny of UNK UNK is sealed from the beginning she will proceed into the dark STOP 
START as she goes she herself will be illuminated STOP 
START at the beginning of the play she has partial UNK and at the end she has complete UNK but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark STOP 
START that is the play STOP 
START within this notion clarity is possible but for us who are neither greek nor UNK there is not such clarity STOP 
START the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary total salvation STOP 
START but where we have both dark and light we have also the UNK STOP 
START the key word in my plays is perhaps STOP 
START given a theological lead i asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays STOP 
START well really there is none at all STOP 
START i have no religious feeling STOP 
START once i had a religious emotion STOP 
START it was at my first communion STOP 
START no more STOP 
START my mother was deeply religious STOP 
START so was my brother STOP 
START he UNK down at his bed as long as he could UNK STOP 
START my father had none STOP 
START the family was protestant but for me it was only UNK and i let it go STOP 
START my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died STOP 
START at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie STOP 
START irish UNK is not attractive but it is deeper STOP 
START when you pass a church on an irish bus all the hands UNK in the sign of the cross STOP 
START one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the UNK STOP 
START but do the plays deal with the same UNK of experience religion must also deal with yes for they deal with distress STOP 
START some people object to this in my writing STOP 
START at a party an english intellectual so-called asked me why i write always about distress STOP 
START as if it were UNK to do so wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood STOP 
START i told him no that i had had a very happy childhood STOP 
START then he thought me more UNK than ever STOP 
START i left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi STOP 
START on the glass UNK between me and the driver were three signs one asked for help for the blind another help for UNK and the third for relief for the war UNK STOP 
START one does not have to look for distress STOP 
START it is screaming at you even in the UNK of london STOP 
START lunch was over and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming at us STOP 
START the personal quality of samuel UNK is similar to qualities i had found in the plays STOP 
START he says nothing that UNK experience within a closed pattern STOP 
START perhaps stands in place of commitment STOP 
START at the same time he is plainly sympathetic clearly friendly STOP 
START if there were only the mess all would be clear there is also UNK STOP 
START as a christian i know i do not stand where UNK stands but i do see much of what he sees STOP 
START as a writer on the theater i have paid close attention to the plays STOP 
START harold UNK is right to say that waiting for UNK is a reflection he calls it a distorted reflection of the UNK and UNK of UNK present politics UNK and common way of life STOP 
START yet it is not only europe the play refers to STOP 
START waiting for UNK sells even better in america than in france STOP 
START the consciousness it UNK may have come earlier to europe than to america but it is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic UNK UNK them into a time of UNK the UNK ends of culture STOP 
START america is now joining europe in this mature phase of development STOP 
START whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic UNK now going on in the countries of asia and africa and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold STOP

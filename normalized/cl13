START she was wearing a brown cotton dress cut across the UNK in a way that was supposed to make her look UNK a UNK set into the skirt and UNK UNK below STOP 
START she UNK the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows STOP 
START why on earth did i send him off to work was excuse enough to keep him home that young mr. UNK still over there STOP

START i can't be UNK every time those cops turn around they'll think i did something STOP 
START he couldn't see the grin that split her mouth teeth that UNK into the phone were like a UNK STOP 
START you'll just have to risk it STOP

START UNK STOP 
START come home right away STOP 
START she UNK the receiver into its holder and stepped away STOP 
START her eyes were bright with anticipation STOP 
START in his office mr. UNK replaced the phone slowly STOP 
START he rose from his chair STOP 
START he had to UNK then went to the window and UNK there with the fresh breeze on his face STOP 
START he got his hat out of the closet STOP 
START for a moment he thought of going into UNK office to explain that he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a UNK in his head that he decided to let it go STOP 
START he passed the UNK in the outer office UNK i've got to go out for a little while STOP 
START let her call UNK if she wanted to let UNK raise the roof or even can him he didn't care STOP 
START he got into the car STOP 
START putting the key into the switch pressing the UNK with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast UNK almost beyond the ability of his shaking body STOP 
START once out in the street the traffic was a UNK UNK in which he UNK UNK STOP 
START when he turned into the highway that led to the UNK of the city and then rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes UNK in air and UNK and UNK his eyes to clear them of tears STOP 
START what on earth was in UNK mind that she wanted him up there UNK on what the cops were doing did she think he could do tried to ignore what his own common sense told him but it wasn't possible motives were too UNK STOP 
START she wanted him to get into trouble STOP 
START she wanted the police to notice him suspect him STOP 
START she was going to keep on UNK UNK UNK suggesting and UNK until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions STOP 
START and he knew in that moment with a cold UNK of despair a dying of old hopes that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors STOP 
START nothing UNK open enough STOP 
START they'd have some UNK to repeat to the police STOP 
START though his inner thoughts UNK at it he forced himself to think back UNK the scene in which mae claimed to have caught him UNK the child STOP 
START it hadn't UNK to anything STOP 
START there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions STOP 
START a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of the garage at the new house and the young UNK girl turning startled to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as mae had UNK on the light STOP 
START suppose the cops somehow got hold of that it hadn't been what it seemed he'd had no idea the girl was in there STOP 
START he hadn't touched her STOP 
START and when he came to examine the scene there was a certain UNK to it it had the smell of planning and a swift suspicion UNK into his mind STOP 
START too monstrous of course STOP 
START mae wouldn't have UNK a thing like that STOP 
START it was just that little UNK played into her hands STOP 
START like this murder STOP 
START he leaned on the wheel UNK it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring order into his thoughts STOP 
START he felt UNK and sick STOP 
START there was no use UNK off into a territory of utter UNK STOP 
START mae was his wife STOP 
START she was married to him for better or for worse STOP 
START she wouldn't be UNK planning his destruction STOP 
START but she was STOP 
START she was STOP 
START even as the conviction of truth roared through him UNK his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand UNK to head up the road for home doing her UNK STOP 
START he drove and the road UNK familiar scenes crept past on either side STOP 
START he came to a stretch of old orange UNK the trees dead some of them UNK and then there was an UNK shopping area and tract houses STOP 
START he had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide STOP 
START but he couldn't imagine where STOP 
START there was really no place to go finally except home to mae STOP 
START at the gate he slowed looking around STOP 
START cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just standing there UNK didn't even look up STOP 
START behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man arthur was straight something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report something STOP 
START UNK stepped on the gas STOP 
START a new idea UNK in from nowhere STOP 
START he could go to the police STOP 
START he could tell them his fears of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how mae had UNK and how she had held it over him the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his own UNK and UNK and UNK silent patience STOP 
START he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department STOP 
START it wasn't what mae would want him to do though STOP 
START he was sure of this STOP 
START once he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had UNK all the UNK of worry and UNK there wouldn't be very much for mae to do STOP 
START at that moment UNK almost slammed on the UNK to go back to cooper and ask if UNK was about STOP 
START it would be such a relief STOP 
START what was that old sign supposed to be painted over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here UNK said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight i'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be STOP 
START they've worried they've UNK awake nights they've shook at the slightest UNK they've UNK their own destruction and now it's all over and they can give up STOP 
START sure they're giving up hope STOP 
START hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK waved a hand at the empty street STOP 
START glad to see you go STOP 
START he drove into the UNK space before the garage and got out UNK the car door STOP 
START he looked up and down the street STOP 
START if UNK car had been in sight UNK would have walked directly to it STOP 
START he went to the front door and opened it and looked in STOP 
START mae entered the room from the UNK to the kitchen STOP 
START she had a cup of something UNK coffee perhaps in one hand a fresh piece of toast in the other STOP 
START she stood there watching UNK come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge UNK of her white teeth STOP 
START mae i've been thinking she said UNK the toast STOP 
START didn't you have an old pair of painting UNK in the garage used them that time you painted the porch at our other house STOP 
START and then you wiped up some UNK STOP 
START she had caught him off guard no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster STOP 
START no STOP 
START wait a minute STOP 
START what do you i've been looking for them and they're gone STOP 
START i'm sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago STOP 
START or even yesterday STOP 
START you used to paint in them and then you just took them for UNK STOP 
START the police have them now STOP 
START i don't remember any UNK at all STOP 
START they were all faded STOP 
START worn through at the knees STOP 
START she stood UNK and chewing and watching STOP 
START green paint wasn't it i'm not sure of the color STOP 
START but you had them STOP 
START mae sit down STOP 
START put down the cup of coffee STOP 
START tell me what this is all about STOP 
START she shook her head STOP 
START she took another UNK of toast STOP 
START UNK noticed almost UNK how she UNK how the whole side of her cheek moved a UNK of fat that extended down into her neck STOP 
START my goodness you ought to remember if i do STOP 
START you're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened STOP 
START tell them the truth or something before they come here STOP 
START a UNK UNK entered UNK being nerves seemed UNK down to the tips of his UNK fingers and his UNK felt stiff and UNK UNK to break like an UNK at any moment STOP 
START i've never owned any painting UNK STOP

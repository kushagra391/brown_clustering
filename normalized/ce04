START the lyric UNK of UNK UNK UNK its elemental rhythms and infectious UNK make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners STOP 
START but for students of musical forms and UNK UNK the work presents its problems STOP 
START since it requires only five players it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music yet it calls for a double bass an instrument generally regarded as UNK STOP 
START moreover the piece is written in five movements rather than the conventional four of most UNK and this gives the UNK a UNK or UNK flavor STOP 
START the many and frequent performances of the UNK serve to emphasize the UNK nature of its writing STOP 
START some UNK are of UNK dimensions with the UNK given free UNK STOP 
START other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation STOP 
START in these readings the double bass is either kept UNK in the background or it is dressed in UNK UNK the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop STOP 
START recently i was struck UNK by the UNK approaches when in the course of one afternoon and evening i listened to no fewer than ten different performances STOP 
START the occasion for this UNK UNK UNK UNK in its great UNK of the century series of the UNK UNK version STOP 
START let me say at the outset that the music sounded as UNK on the last playing as it did on the first STOP 
START whether considered alone or in relation to other UNK UNK 40 is a document of prime importance STOP 
START UNK UNK was one of the greatest UNK players of all time and any UNK of his on this UNK is valuable STOP 
START but UNK was a great teacher in addition to being a great UNK and the fact that four of the ten UNK i listened to are by UNK pupils UNK UNK frank UNK UNK UNK and victor UNK also UNK light on the UNK UNK skills STOP 
START certain UNK UNK are common to all five UNK UNK most notably the UNK UNK which UNK from the conventional UNK in that the two notes are struck simultaneously STOP 
START but the most impressive testimony to UNK distinction as a teacher is reflected by the UNK which marks each UNK approach as distinctly his own STOP 
START UNK emphasis on structural clarity his UNK rhythmic UNK and UNK intensity all tend to UNK his reading as a UNK one STOP 
START yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master and as a result the playing here has humor UNK and UNK humanity STOP 
START this is a UNK interpretation but it is never UNK STOP 
START and although UNK UNK UNK with excitement it is UNK faithful to UNK dynamic UNK and phrase indications STOP 
START the piano performance on this UNK is one that really demands a search for UNK STOP 
START about the pro UNK contribution i am less happy STOP 
START i for one rather UNK that UNK didn't UNK with the UNK UNK whose rugged athletic playing was a good deal closer to this UNK UNK outlook than the style of the belgian group STOP 
START from a technical standpoint the string playing is good but the pro UNK people fail to enter into the spirit of things here STOP 
START the UNK in particular is very UNK with UNK and UNK and his tone is UNK and UNK STOP 
START the UNK recording offers rather faded string tone but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet STOP 
START there is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the UNK movement and i suspect that this is due to UNK UNK between sides of the original aj STOP 
START turning to the more modern UNK UNK london offers the most sophisticated UNK work STOP 
START every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out and of these i would especially UNK the UNK UNK touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation an obvious indication that he is playing with UNK musicians and the UNK UNK throughout STOP 
START some of UNK playing strikes me as UNK however STOP 
START why for example does he favor two UNK rather than one for the third movement UNK musicians from the vienna UNK are somewhat lacking in UNK but their contribution is UNK and appealing STOP 
START special UNK to the double bass playing of UNK UNK his UNK UNK sound UNK a delightful UNK to the performance STOP 
START the UNK arts edition UNK is a model of UNK and organization STOP 
START it is moreover a perfectly integrated ensemble effort STOP 
START but having lived with the UNK for some time now i find the performance less exciting than either UNK or UNK whose superb performance with the UNK UNK has still to be recorded and a good deal less filled with humor than UNK STOP 
START UNK work is very much UNK to UNK but the sound on his UNK UNK is dated and you will have a hard time UNK a copy of it STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK angel and victor UNK UNK UNK victor UNK give us UNK string playing both in UNK style UNK by UNK piano playing STOP 
START UNK has acquired some of UNK UNK manner but his playing is of limited insight STOP 
START UNK UNK westminster and UNK UNK UNK UNK are both UNK UNK UNK but rather UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK playing with a group of musicians from the UNK ensemble gives a sturdy reading in much the same vein as that of the UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK has UNK him beautiful sound and this UNK UNK it sells for UNK is worthy of consideration STOP 
START returning once again to the UNK UNK i am UNK UNK by the UNK of this UNK musical penetration STOP 
START here is truly a great recording of the century and its greatness is by no means UNK by the fact that it is not quite perfect STOP 
START this recording surely belongs in UNK collection STOP 
START must records always sound like records the beginning of commercial recording new UNK UNK to be UNK from the real thing have regularly been put in circulation STOP 
START seen in perspective many of these UNK have a genuine claim to be UNK STOP 
START although lacking absolute UNK they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for UNK of the original STOP 
START on the basis of what they give us we can know how the young UNK sang appreciate the distinctive qualities of UNK under UNK UNK UNK or sense the type of ensemble UNK created in his years with the new york UNK STOP 
START since the concept of high UNK became important some dozen years ago the claims of technical improvements have UNK UNK STOP 
START in many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than UNK effects the first hearing was fascinating and the second UNK as the gap between sound and substance became clearer STOP 
START other UNK with better claims to musical interest survived UNK to acquire in time the status of UNK STOP 
START if we return to them today we have no difficulty UNK their UNK but we find them still UNK STOP 
START records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music STOP 
START this difference is made up of many factors STOP 
START some of them are obvious such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of UNK and social UNK STOP 
START music often sounds best to me when i can dress UNK and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat STOP 
START from the technical standpoint records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color texture complexity range intensity UNK and pitch of the original STOP 
START any UNK of one of these factors is UNK although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated UNK on the basis of standard tests STOP 
START yet it is the accumulation of UNK the fitting together of UNK bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness that makes records sound like records STOP 
START the sound may be good if you know the real thing you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation STOP 
START UNK new UNK second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one STOP 
START like the recent UNK from london high UNK sept. 1961 it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating UNK effects STOP 
START because of this only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the UNK triumph STOP 
START the UNK way to describe this release is to say that it UNK an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal UNK of its musical values STOP 
START the engineering as such never UNK upon your consciousness STOP 
START the effect of the recording is very open and natural with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance STOP 
START this absence of UNK UNK and UNK bass not only produces greater UNK but it UNK UNK fatigue STOP 
START a contributing factor is the perspective the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained STOP 
START the orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow UNK UNK UNK and other UNK UNK to playing STOP 
START yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an UNK perfect hall STOP 
START command has achieved the ideal amount of UNK STOP 
START the music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full UNK the hall never UNK as a UNK STOP 
START the UNK remains that of the instruments UNK by resonance STOP 
START all of this would be wasted of course if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction STOP 
START for me it has more of both elements than the majority of its UNK STOP 
START steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score UNK tradition and has built his performance on the intention to UNK as UNK as possible exactly what UNK set down on paper STOP 
START those accustomed to broader more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one STOP 
START without losing the distinctive UNK of UNK rhythm the UNK is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly UNK quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect STOP 
START the UNK ma UNK UNK of the first UNK of the UNK is taken literally and may shock you as the real UNK UNK UNK of the UNK is likely to bring you to your feet STOP 
START in the end however the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it UNK STOP 
START steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must UNK in this score and he UNK at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song STOP 
START the engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result STOP 
START too many records seem to reduce a work of UNK complexity to a melody and its UNK STOP 
START the command technique UNK you to listen to the depth of the UNK STOP 
START your ear takes you into the ensemble and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score STOP 
START it is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high UNK of real musical significance for the home music UNK STOP 
START the first substantially complete UNK UNK and the only one of its scope since UNK UNK UNK edition of 1958 for angel this set is i'm afraid likely to provide more UNK UNK than enjoyment STOP 
START the already faded UNK UNK of the naive music itself UNK entirely in UNK UNK contrasts between UNK UNK power and UNK if UNK UNK STOP 
START and in its UNK frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and UNK UNK the recording sounds as though it had been UNK for UNK UNK STOP 
START the home UNK is UNK all right but the experience is a far from pleasant one STOP 
START as with the UNK UNK release UNK UNK for UNK victor i find the UNK less UNK UNK version for all its lack of UNK UNK the more UNK UNK but this may be the result of processing defects in my UNK copies STOP

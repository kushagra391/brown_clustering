START the injured german veteran was a former UNK twenty-four years old who had been wounded by UNK in the back of the head STOP 
START this resulted in damage to the UNK UNK and very probably to the left side of the UNK also STOP 
START in any event the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became UNK blind while at the same time apparently the sense of touch remained essentially intact STOP 
START UNK blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual UNK a condition in which for example one is unable to remember something just seen or to UNK up a UNK of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence STOP 
START this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his UNK capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed his eyes he had absolutely no UNK that is UNK awareness UNK STOP 
START the necessary UNK as the authors themselves interpret it would seem to be this 1 UNK qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch as such STOP 
START we do not arrive at UNK images by means of the sense of touch by itself STOP 
START 2 UNK becomes part of the UNK sensation only by way of visual UNK is there is in the true sense only a visual space STOP 
START the underlying assumption of course is that only sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully UNK way to locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being UNK UNK if not totally inadequate in this regard STOP 
START this is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel STOP 
START therefore if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of UNK awareness in a UNK person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled the conclusion seems UNK that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the UNK of things and that actual sight or visual UNK are necessary STOP 
START the force of the UNK analysis if indeed it has any force can be felt by the reader i believe only after three questions have been successfully answered STOP 
START 1 what allows us to think that the patient had no UNK UNK when his eyes were closed 2 what evidence is there that he was UNK blind 3 how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not UNK disturbed by his head injury shall consider these in the UNK order of their presentation STOP 
START obviously a satisfactory answer to the third question is UNK if the argument is to get under way at all for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's UNK sensitivity had been UNK by the UNK UNK any findings UNK in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course as evidence to establish the desired conclusion STOP 
START the answer the authors give to it therefore is of supreme importance STOP 
START it is as follows the usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of UNK pressure pain temperature as well as the UNK UNK muscular feelings feelings in the UNK and joints were as such essentially intact although they seemed in comparison with normal reactions to be somewhat UNK over the entire body STOP 
START the supposed UNK sense of UNK location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as the direction and scope of a movement UNK executed with one of his members proved to have been on the contrary very considerably affected STOP 
START the authors insist however that these UNK in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic UNK in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight STOP 
START first of all what is their evidence that the UNK apparatus was UNK UNK 1 when an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold sharp or UNK rough or smooth flexible soft or hard he could tell simply by the feel of it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on STOP 
START and he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately before even though they were altogether UNK to him and could not be identified by him is he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was STOP 
START 2 the patient UNK an UNK efficiency in a new trade STOP 
START because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train himself for a new line of work that of a UNK an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly UNK sense of form and UNK STOP 
START it seems clear when one takes into consideration the UNK UNK UNK of the patient we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question the one concerning the UNK blindness of the patient that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual UNK and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision STOP 
START and so the authors conclude the conduct of the patient in his UNK life and in his work even more than the foregoing facts mentioned above under 1 leave UNK no room for doubt that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was UNK to put the same thing in physiological terms that the UNK of the UNK apparatus from the UNK up to the UNK centers in the brain that is from one end to the other was UNK STOP 
START if the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in UNK himself UNK and in UNK objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his UNK visual condition STOP 
START but before we can do this we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2 we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand STOP 
START in what ways then did the patient's UNK blindness UNK itself could not see objects as unified UNK and organized figures as a person does with normal vision STOP 
START the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund of visual UNK of objects as objects therefore he could not recognize even UNK things upon seeing them again STOP 
START instead he constantly became lost in parts and components of them confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects and so on unless he allowed time to trace the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours STOP 
START according to his own testimony he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally UNK UNK of color of a more or less UNK size their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether STOP 
START but by the tracing procedure he could in a strange obviously UNK manner find the UNK form piece as it were the UNK mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a UNK or whatever it turned out to be STOP 
START if however the figure to be UNK were complicated composed of several UNK UNK and so on even the tracing process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts STOP 
START this meant UNK that the patient could not read at all without making UNK movements of the head or body became easily confused by UNK marks inserted between UNK words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters and could recognize a simple straight line or a UNK one only by tracing it STOP 
START the patient himself denied that he had any visual UNK at all there was ample evidence of the following sort to UNK him STOP 
START after a conversation with another man he was able to UNK practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like STOP 
START nor could he call up UNK of close friends or relatives STOP 
START in short both his own UNK and his UNK blindness when he looked at objects seem to present UNK evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all STOP 
START he was UNK of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do STOP 
START he could not recognize it was absolutely UNK with it because he had no visual memory at all STOP 
START therefore his only UNK was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure STOP 
START then he might finally recognize it apparently by UNK the visual UNK actually being seen with UNK feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements STOP 
START this would mean it can readily be seen that again for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual UNK STOP 
START as one would UNK the procedure however could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding visual UNK and the UNK beginning of the tracing movement would provide UNK as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of UNK STOP 
START men trees automobiles houses and so on objects continually confronted in everyday life had each its characteristic UNK and became easily UNK at the very beginning of tracing by an UNK as to what each was STOP 
START dice for example he UNK from black dots on a white surface STOP 
START he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects but their size and the dots gave them away STOP 
START and the authors give numerous instances of calculated UNK on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of UNK himself and how UNK he became at it STOP 
START often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly without the tracing motions solely on the basis of UNK differences among the UNK things which appeared in his visual experience STOP 
START perhaps the very important question what is then exactly the role of UNK UNK in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things has now been raised in the UNK mind and in the following form STOP 
START if the patient can perceive figure UNK when he cannot perceive it UNK then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact with the UNK aspects of things in independence of visual UNK at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even this much UNK awareness on the part of UNK touch is denied by the authors STOP 
START how then do the UNK UNK function in all this authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability UNK 1 to perceive figure and 2 to locate objects in space with his eyes closed or turned away from the object concerned STOP 
START quite naturally they make the investigation first by UNK the patient from making any movements at all and then later by UNK it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to STOP 
START when the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following striking results occurred STOP

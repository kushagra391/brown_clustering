START another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb UNK of a metal in UNK when the product is relatively UNK STOP 
START this work gave a heat of formation of aluminum UNK which closely UNK a value which had been determined by a less direct method and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago STOP 
START similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product UNK UNK STOP 
START the development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion STOP 
START in one of these an UNK device to study systems UNK up to UNK af and 100 UNK pressure a major goal was achieved STOP 
START the accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an UNK wire during a few UNK was UNK when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent STOP 
START this agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals STOP 
START the method of UNK UNK a fixed resistance element as a UNK STOP 
START the element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the UNK wire and the UNK heating of the element is measured with high accuracy STOP 
START this is used as a reference for UNK the UNK heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element STOP 
START a UNK UNK has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion STOP

START the UNK of the UNK consists of a piece of aluminum foil approximately af placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera STOP 
START the opening action is obtained when a UNK charged to high voltage is suddenly UNK through the foil STOP 
START during the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll UNK toward its center line thus allowing light to pass into the camera STOP 
START experiments have shown that the UNK is 75 percent open in about UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil STOP 
START laboratory measurements of UNK radio spectra STOP 
START besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm UNK the spectra of UNK radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms UNK and small UNK STOP 
START the detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on UNK gas clouds and perhaps planetary UNK STOP 
START among the most likely producers of UNK radio line spectra are the light UNK UNK oh and UNK less likely sources are the heavier UNK UNK UNK and aj STOP 
START very small UNK of these UNK should be UNK UNK gas UNK as low as af UNK per af may be sufficient as compared to the af hydrogen UNK af required for detection of the UNK line STOP 
START high sensitivity in radio UNK is achieved by reducing the UNK of the receiver only with precise UNK of the line frequencies is an UNK search for the radio spectra of these UNK feasible STOP 
START to secure precise measurements of these frequencies a research program in free radical UNK UNK has been started STOP 
START since conventional methods are UNK at the low frequencies of these molecular UNK the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead STOP 
START this involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shifts the UNK spectra to a UNK high UNK range where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity STOP 
START the first UNK UNK investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the oh radical STOP 
START results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong UNK lines by which oh may be identified in UNK gas frequencies are UNK and UNK af with an uncertainty of UNK af STOP 
START success in observing these UNK lines has so far apparently been confined to the laboratory observations have yet to be reported STOP

START -hlthe UNK of helium UNK UNK have been investigated in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from UNK to UNK af STOP 
START surface temperature UNK have been found to exist in liquid helium UNK contained in UNK and UNK UNK storage UNK STOP 
START the gradient was about one half of a UNK at UNK af but increased to several UNK for bath temperatures slightly greater than the UNK point STOP 
START a UNK head UNK has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium STOP 
START however the surface temperature gradient can produce UNK UNK measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless UNK are taken to UNK the tube which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure UNK from the liquid helium surface STOP 
START it has also been observed in helium 2 that large UNK can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure UNK STOP 
START this has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure UNK STOP 
START in this case also the design of the UNK can be modified to reduce the helium film flow STOP

START a small pressure UNK UNK the UNK and changes the UNK between the UNK and an UNK UNK plate UNK UNK UNK apart for af STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK surfaces support the UNK when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the UNK from UNK the UNK limit STOP 
START over a temperature range from 25 to 200 af and at pressures up to 250 UNK an UNK of 300 UNK applied for a period of one day results in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one UNK of UNK STOP

START this project was carried out under UNK of the ballistic missile division of the air research and development command u.s. air force and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding STOP 
START a significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of UNK numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen UNK region STOP

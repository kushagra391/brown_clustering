START since emotional reactions in the higher UNK depend on individual experience and are aroused in man in addition by complex symbols one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from the UNK STOP 
START in experiments with UNK application of UNK on the UNK UNK the transmission of impulses from the UNK to the hypothalamus was demonstrated STOP 
START moreover the UNK of the hypothalamus to UNK stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions STOP 
START even more complex and obviously UNK induced forms of emotional UNK could be UNK in UNK a on seeing UNK b but not a rabbit in emotional stress STOP 
START a previously UNK conditioned reaction was restored in UNK a and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic UNK STOP 
START it seems to follow that by and large an UNK exists between the UNK and the UNK as far as emotional reactivity is concerned and that the balance between the two systems determines the emotional UNK of the UNK STOP 
START in addition the UNK relations play a great role in UNK as UNK interesting experiment on the communication of affect UNK STOP 
START but even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the UNK sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus and the UNK brain is UNK by the UNK STOP 
START UNK stressed correctly the importance of the UNK brain for preservation of the individual and the species as evidenced by the influence of the UNK brain including the hypothalamus on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions STOP 
START it should be added that in man UNK UNK probably play a role in the fusion of emotional processes with those underlying perception memory imagination and UNK STOP 
START previous experiences are obviously of great importance for the UNK and UNK emotional response STOP 
START the UNK brain as well as the UNK is known to contribute to memory but this UNK is beyond the scope of this paper STOP 
START 13 STOP 
START UNK balance and its significance after this brief discussion of UNK UNK and UNK relations let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and its physiological and UNK significance STOP 
START UNK processes take place between UNK and hypothalamus via UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START thus UNK UNK induced by UNK application of UNK to a minute area in the UNK UNK with UNK present in the hypothalamus and cause increased UNK UNK STOP 
START on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic UNK through the UNK of a UNK into the UNK hypothalamus causes a UNK in frequency and UNK of UNK UNK UNK until the hypothalamic UNK is restored STOP 
START apparently a positive UNK exists between the UNK hypothalamus and the UNK UNK STOP 
START consequently if for any reason the hypothalamic UNK falls below the physiological level the UNK UNK UNK lead to a UNK state of activity in the UNK with UNK reduction in the UNK UNK STOP 
START obviously a vicious cycle develops STOP 
START this tendency can be broken either by UNK hypothalamic UNK directly or via UNK UNK STOP 
START it is believed that drug therapy and UNK involve the former and UNK the latter mechanism STOP 
START before we comment further on these UNK conditions we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from UNK STOP 
START thus a low intensity of UNK UNK UNK in sleep and a high one during UNK resulting in UNK UNK UNK in the former and UNK in the latter condition STOP 
START moreover the dominance in UNK action with UNK UNK of the sympathetic at the hypothalamic level UNK by its UNK action the autonomic symptoms of sleep and by its action on the UNK a UNK in the reactivity of the UNK and motor apparatus of the UNK nervous system STOP 
START with the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus the opposite changes occur STOP 
START since electrical stimulation of the UNK hypothalamus produces the effects of UNK while stimulation of the UNK hypothalamus UNK sleep it may be said that the reactivity of the whole UNK is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus STOP 
START similar effects can be induced UNK via the UNK UNK in man and animals STOP 
START of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect STOP 
START although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it there is sufficient UNK to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a UNK dominance STOP 
START the former comprise UNK and UNK drugs the latter the UNK STOP 
START specific differences exist in the action of different drugs belonging to the same group as for instance between UNK and UNK STOP 
START important as these differences are they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the UNK side we produce UNK whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes UNK effects and eventually UNK changes STOP 
START the emotional states produced by drugs influence the UNK UNK in a characteristic manner UNK in the UNK of the experimental animal after administration of UNK but UNK after application of UNK and UNK drugs STOP 
START the shock UNK act likewise on the hypothalamic balance STOP 
START physiological experiments and clinical observations have shown that these procedures influence the UNK controlled UNK UNK and increase sympathetic UNK STOP 
START they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side STOP 
START this explains the beneficial effect of UNK therapy in certain UNK and a shift in the reaction from UNK to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system as shown by the UNK test STOP 
START some investigators have found a UNK between UNK and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated by the UNK test and UNK between clinical UNK and increasing deviation of this test from the UNK STOP 
START nevertheless the theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has a profound influence on the clinical behavior of UNK patients has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients STOP 
START the UNK and UNK tests applied with certain UNK are reliable UNK of this central autonomic balance but for the sake of UNK autonomic and clinical states and of studying the effect of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions additional tests seem to be desirable STOP 
START it was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring UNK in UNK patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the UNK cycle STOP 
START a change in the balance to the UNK side leads in the normal individual to sleep or in special circumstances to UNK UNK or UNK and UNK STOP 
START in both conditions the emotional and UNK sensitivity is UNK but no depression occurs such as is seen UNK or may be produced in normal persons by drugs STOP 
START the fundamental differences between physiological and UNK states of UNK and also of sympathetic dominance remain to be UNK STOP 
START perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic UNK which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to UNK UNK in reactivity STOP 
START a state of UNK UNK of the hypothalamus induced UNK causes not only an increase in the UNK reactivity of this structure to direct and UNK induced UNK but leads also to an autonomic UNK a stimulus acting UNK under control conditions UNK in this state of UNK a UNK response conditioned reactions are UNK altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is UNK beyond a critical level and several types of UNK changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic UNK are observed STOP 
START if for instance such a change is produced by one or a few UNK UNK or UNK previously UNK conditioned reactions UNK STOP 
START however if these procedures are applied more often conditioned emotional responses are temporarily UNK STOP 
START in other studies loss of UNK in previously established conditioned UNK resulted from repeated UNK UNK treatments suggesting a fundamental UNK in the balance between UNK and UNK UNK processes STOP 
START it has further been shown that 1 an experimental UNK in its initial stages is associated with a UNK shift in the central autonomic balance 2 drugs UNK the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions 3 in a state of depression the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to UNK a conditioned reaction but cause an increased UNK instead of the UNK UNK UNK effect on the aj STOP 
START these are few and seemingly UNK data but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental UNK in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic balance has been altered by physiological experimentation UNK action or clinical processes STOP 
START 14 STOP 
START UNK the physiological basis of some form of UNK the foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and UNK forms of emotion STOP 
START if this is the case one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise STOP 
START we pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to UNK UNK and UNK symptoms particularly in certain types of personality but it is also known that the UNK of a strong emotion UNK may cure a battle UNK STOP 
START this phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the UNK STOP 
START being a strictly physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself STOP 
START UNK experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area STOP 
START he showed UNK that anxiety is a learned conditioned reaction and is the basis of experimental and clinical UNK and assumed therefore that the UNK changes which UNK the UNK are functional and UNK STOP 
START an important observation of UNK served as a guide post to achieve such a UNK by physiological means STOP 
START in a conditioning experiment he demonstrated the UNK between feeding and pain STOP 
START a mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus and was followed by feeding STOP 
START the pain became thus the symbol for food and UNK UNK UNK conditioned UNK STOP 
START even when the intensity of the UNK was increased gradually it failed to UNK any signs of pain STOP 
START since strong UNK UNK produce an experimental UNK during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental situation UNK thought that he could UNK the UNK UNK to UNK the UNK symptoms through feeding STOP 
START appropriate experiments showed that this is indeed possible STOP 
START he then applied this principle of UNK UNK to human UNK STOP 
START he took advantage of the UNK between aggressive UNK and anxiety and found a relatively rapid UNK of anxiety when the former attitude was established STOP 
START for the interpretation of these significant investigations it should be remembered that UNK relations exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and UNK functions which are closely associated with the emotions STOP 
START the UNK UNK seems to be based on this UNK relation between the UNK and UNK systems STOP 
START furthermore a functional UNK exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety STOP 
START although in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present different UNK patterns UNK UNK and anxiety respectively as indicated by the rate of the UNK of the UNK the state of the muscle tone and the UNK test STOP 
START the psychological UNK of these emotional states seems to be reflected in or based on this marked difference STOP 
START 15 STOP 
START UNK remarks in our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and UNK range we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity of the UNK and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system and their influence on the UNK and UNK systems respectively STOP 
START we stressed the UNK relation of these systems with respect to the UNK downward discharge as well as regarding the UNK discharge STOP 
START although we are still far from a complete understanding of these problems as a first UNK it is suggested that UNK in the hypothalamic balance with UNK changes in the UNK UNK account for major changes in behavior seen in various UNK and states of emotions in man and UNK under physiological circumstances in experimental and clinical UNK and as the result of UNK agents STOP 
START in view of the important role which emotional UNK play in the UNK of UNK and UNK UNK and the UNK observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several instances it is further suggested that a hypothalamic UNK may play an important role in UNK mental changes STOP

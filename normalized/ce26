START UNK UNK represented a minimal chance of either UNK greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life STOP 
START he was born in the small UNK town of UNK on the island of UNK in the UNK part of UNK on august 14 UNK STOP 
START his father UNK was the village UNK whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family let alone UNK them in a town without even a school STOP 
START the two older boys hans and UNK his junior by a year therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly UNK nearby for instruction in german wife taught the two boys to read and write UNK STOP 
START other brothers later joined them for instruction with UNK the UNK and also UNK was added to bible reading german and UNK in the informal curriculum STOP 
START UNK contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned such as the pastor to supplement the simple teaching STOP 
START from the town UNK hans learned drawing and mathematics and from a university student some academic subjects STOP 
START the mayor of the town taught them english and french STOP 
START whatever hans or UNK learned separately they passed on to each other read every book that they could UNK in the village STOP 
START at 12 hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the UNK shop which helped UNK his interest in medicine and science STOP 
START his earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life STOP 
START in UNK the brothers decided to enter the university of UNK founded in UNK and the following spring found them at the university preparing to UNK for the autumn session STOP 
START while hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine physics and astronomy his brother studied law STOP 
START the brothers continued to help each other during their studies sharing a joint purse UNK together in the UNK and dining together at the home of their aunt STOP 
START they UNK their income by small government assistance by UNK and UNK wherever they could STOP 
START so impressive were those serious years of study at the university that hans later wrote to be perfectly free the young man must UNK in the great kingdom of thought and imagination is a struggle there in which if he falls it is easy for him to rise again there is freedom of UNK there which draws after it no UNK consequences on society STOP 
START i lived in this UNK contest where each day UNK a new difficulty gained a new truth or UNK a previous error STOP 
START he openly UNK his pleasure in UNK and writing about science STOP 
START in this third year at the university hans in UNK was awarded the first important UNK of recognition a gold UNK for his essay on limits of poetry and prose STOP 
START he completed his training in UNK also taking his degree with high honors in UNK and in UNK was awarded the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine STOP 
START he proposed a fresh theory of UNK which later was accepted in chemical practices STOP 
START UNK of scientific activity UNK student days were at a time when europe was in a new intellectual UNK following the UNK in america and in france germany and italy were rising from UNK UNK and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the continent STOP 
START the new century opened with oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an UNK shop in UNK and as UNK at the university STOP 
START he was stirred by the announcement of UNK discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the UNK pile to experiments with UNK and UNK STOP 
START the following year he devoted to the customary UNK traveling in germany france and the UNK meeting the UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START he also met count UNK born benjamin thompson in UNK mass. who was then serving the UNK of UNK and the UNK UNK were UNK main contacts in science STOP 
START from UNK UNK where he stayed for 10 days he wrote the first question asked everywhere is about UNK STOP 
START as everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes i have invented i have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes in UNK i used 30 and intend to carry it with me STOP 
START oersted joined UNK at UNK and stayed with him for 3 weeks continuing their correspondence after he left STOP 
START with UNK he was exposed to the fantastic UNK of ideas that UNK through his UNK UNK but UNK mind STOP 
START oersted UNK UNK notes into an essay in french which was submitted to the UNK de france for its annual prize of UNK UNK STOP 
START the sound UNK of this UNK genius were so UNK by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him STOP 
START in may UNK UNK in another flight of fancy wrote to oersted a letter that contained a remarkable UNK STOP 
START he related events on earth to UNK UNK phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum UNK of the UNK UNK with the years of important electrical UNK STOP 
START thus UNK UNK to the invention of the UNK jar by UNK UNK that of the UNK by UNK UNK produced the UNK of UNK and UNK the UNK pile STOP 
START UNK proceeded you now emerge into a new UNK in which late in the year UNK or UNK you will have to UNK STOP 
START this we might well witness STOP 
START UNK died in UNK and oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it STOP 
START in UNK oersted returned to UNK and applied for the UNK chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a UNK STOP 
START however he continued UNK and UNK publishing the results of his experiments in german and UNK UNK STOP 
START in UNK his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the UNK university though not realizing full UNK UNK until UNK STOP 
START during UNK attendance at the university it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for UNK in the sciences STOP 
START he was however fortunate in his contact with UNK j. g. l. UNK UNK teacher of chemistry who in addition to his academic chair was also proprietor of the lion UNK in UNK where oersted UNK him STOP 
START UNK maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at UNK disposal during and after his graduation STOP 
START in UNK UNK went abroad and oersted was appointed manager of the lion UNK STOP 
START in february UNK oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a UNK battery of UNK plates of UNK and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of UNK and lead STOP 
START in the following year UNK oersted simultaneously with UNK discovered that UNK increased the strength of a UNK battery more than did UNK STOP 
START eager as he was to pursue this promising line he was so loaded down with the management of the UNK and lectures in the medical and UNK UNK at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoons to UNK STOP 
START he assumed his academic career with the same intensity and UNK that had marked every step in his rise from UNK STOP 
START the university was the only one in UNK and the status of professor represented the upper social level STOP 
START his broad interest in literary political and philosophical movements opened many doors to him STOP 
START his friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong STOP 
START the years UNK and UNK saw him in germany and france again but on this visit to berlin he did not seek out the UNK as he had on his first journey STOP 
START in berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in german and this was issued in french translation paris UNK under the title UNK UNK UNK UNK forces UNK et UNK a work held in very high UNK by the new generation of research UNK STOP 
START his interest in finding a relationship between UNK electricity and UNK is here first indicated STOP 
START chapter 8 is entitled on UNK and in it are included such remarks as one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces STOP 
START the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic UNK and UNK and the UNK of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison STOP 
START it is true that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference STOP 
START the form of UNK activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form STOP 
START there forces are more UNK than in electricity and less than in UNK STOP 
START but in such an important question we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and UNK were only a difficulty and not a thing which is contrary to it STOP 
START one could also add to these UNK that steel loses its UNK by heat which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature just as electrical bodies do STOP 
START it is also found that UNK exists in all bodies of nature as proven by UNK and UNK STOP 
START by that one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces STOP 
START an attempt should be made to see if electricity in its most UNK stage has any action on the UNK as such STOP 
START his plan and intent were clearly UNK STOP 
START oersted returned in UNK and resumed an active part in university and political discussions STOP 
START in one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to UNK in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship STOP 
START he continued as a popular UNK STOP 
START he devised a UNK UNK in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current STOP 
START in UNK under royal command he UNK a very successful UNK expedition to UNK one of the UNK islands being one of three scientists in the expedition STOP 
START it was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition UNK UNK that oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in UNK vapor through which an electric current was made to flow STOP 
START together they also developed a new form of UNK cell in which the wooden UNK was replaced by one of copper thereby producing stronger UNK STOP 
START UNK was among those who witnessed UNK first demonstration of his discovery STOP 
START discovery of UNK the association between electric both UNK and UNK forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades STOP 
START electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had UNK iron and had altered the UNK of compass UNK STOP 
START in the late UNK UNK and van UNK among others had UNK iron by sending an UNK charge through it STOP 
START UNK had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and UNK when a discharge from a UNK jar was sent UNK through a piece of UNK steel making its ends magnetic STOP 
START the resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made UNK STOP 
START the experiments of UNK and others have already been noted but no one had determined the UNK relationship between these two primary forces STOP 
START UNK own earlier experiments were UNK possibly because he had like other UNK laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it STOP 
START the sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of UNK discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of UNK STOP 
START at this lecture oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle STOP

START except for the wine UNK in a restaurant always an UNK UNK unto himself the UNK with the keys to UNK the gates of the wine world are one's dealer and the foreign UNK or UNK who in turn supplies him STOP 
START in instances where both of these are persons or firms with UNK the situation is ideal STOP 
START it may on occasion be anything but that STOP 
START however by UNK a wine dealer and accepting his advice one will soon enough UNK whether he has any knowledge of wines as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and UNK and better yet whether he has a taste for wine STOP 
START again by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers one becomes familiar with the names and UNK of UNK wine dealers and UNK abroad STOP 
START this is important because despite all the efforts of the french government an UNK UNK of UNK UNK trade in wines is still UNK with a UNK approaching UNK UNK and there are many too many UNK who would rather turn a UNK than UNK a UNK reputation overseas STOP 
START a good UNK or UNK will not only be the man or the firm which has UNK the wines from the best UNK or the best parts of them may also be the one who makes and bottles the best UNK sound wines from UNK generally in his own district STOP 
START these are the wines the french themselves use for everyday drinking for even in france virtually no one drinks the UNK UNK on a UNK basis STOP 
START the UNK UNK are expensive and even UNK UNK tire of them STOP 
START and certainly in the case of the UNK or the comparatively UNK wine UNK the UNK and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the UNK UNK as a steady diet without frequent UNK to UNK of less UNK STOP 
START there is nothing UNK UNK about a good UNK from a good UNK STOP 
START some of them are very UNK indeed and there are many good ones UNK unfortunately along with others not so good and worse STOP 
START UNK with a UNK wine dealer and constant experimentation UNK ever from the known to the unknown are the UNK STOP 
START wine UNK are something else again if one is UNK or dining out a great deal their importance UNK STOP 
START most of them the world over operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in france and some other latin countries the customer is to be considered guilty of UNK ignorance until proven otherwise with the burden of proof on the customer himself STOP 
START now the drinking of wine and happily so is for the most part a UNK affair for UNK if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them the supply would dry up in no time at all STOP 
START this is the only valid and UNK argument that may be advanced in defense of the UNK attitude of the common wine UNK STOP 
START a really good wine UNK is paradoxically the UNK and not the UNK of his cellar against the UNK STOP 
START faced on the one hand with an always UNK supply of his best wines and on the other by a UNK usually equipped with UNK UNK it is a wonder indeed that all wine UNK are not UNK with chronic UNK STOP 
START the one way to get around them short of knowing exactly what one wants and UNK to it is to frequent a single establishment until its wine UNK is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money STOP 
START only then perhaps will he reveal his UNK and his UNK STOP 
START wine bought from a dealer should UNK be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served STOP 
START this is especially true of red wines and a practice which though not always UNK is well worth the effort STOP 
START it does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days but in terms of months and years it is fatal STOP 
START wine stored for a long time should be on its side the UNK UNK and air enters to UNK it STOP 
START when UNK wine on its side in a UNK care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the UNK STOP 
START fat bottles such as UNK have a way of rolling around in the UNK and often need little UNK such as a bit of UNK or a chip of wood to hold them in the proper UNK posture STOP 
START too much UNK in the cellar UNK the UNK again with ill effects STOP 
START the best rule of UNK for UNK UNK wine provided the eye has not already spotted it is to smell the wet end of the UNK after pulling it if it UNK of wine the bottle is probably all right it UNK of UNK one has grounds for suspicion STOP 
START UNK rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine they age it UNK STOP 
START the ideal storage temperature for long periods is about UNK degrees with an UNK range of five degrees above or below this provided there are no sudden or frequent changes STOP 
START prolonged UNK is also UNK one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or UNK driven UNK STOP 
START if one lives near a UNK or an express UNK the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time STOP 
START light especially daylight is always bad for wine STOP 
START all in all though there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking people go to extreme lengths in UNK UNK or UNK or UNK without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious UNK STOP 
START no one should wish to deny these UNK the obvious pleasure they derive from all this and to give fair warning where warning is due no one who becomes fond of wines ever UNK acquiring some degree of UNK the fact remains that in most restaurants including some of the best of paris and UNK and UNK the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the UNK is preparing the meal STOP 
START a white wine already at cool cellar temperature may be adequately UNK in a UNK of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator the former is far UNK in about fifteen minutes those who live in a winter climate there is nothing better than a UNK of water and snow STOP 
START though by no means an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time STOP 
START it may be a bit cold when poured again as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt wine should be served in a large UNK glass which is never filled more than half full STOP 
START in this way red wine UNK of itself quite rapidly and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and UNK until after the middle of the meal or the course in the meantime it will have run the UNK of many UNK and interesting stages STOP 
START the only cardinal sin which may be committed in UNK a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire STOP 
START this invariably UNK any UNK character and UNK its UNK underground STOP 
START it should not be forgotten that wines mature UNK in UNK less fast in full bottles slowly in UNK and UNK yet in UNK double UNK UNK UNK and UNK respectively STOP 
START very old red wines often require several hours of UNK and any red wine brought from the cellar within half an hour of UNK should be UNK and allowed some air STOP 
START but white wines never wines should be opened when served having been previously UNK in proportion to their UNK STOP 
START thus UNK or UNK should be very cold UNK or a UNK somewhat less cold STOP 
START UNK is an accepted method for covering up the UNK of many a cheap or poor white wine especially a dry wine and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as UNK STOP 
START the UNK and taste of any white wine will die a UNK death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air STOP 
START to quote professor UNK the last glass of UNK or UNK is as good as the first the first glass of UNK UNK or UNK is a great deal better than the last does not mean though that a red wine improves with prolonged UNK there is a reasonable limit and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day after they have once been opened are never as good STOP 
START if this must be done they should always be UNK and kept in a cool place should be remembered that their lasting qualities are UNK shorter than those of milk STOP 
START a few red wines notably those of the UNK are better consumed at cellar temperature STOP 
START by tradition a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature if anything a little cooler and be aged enough for the UNK and UNK to have worked out and the UNK have settled well STOP 
START thus red wine must if possible never be disturbed or shaken old red wine is often UNK so that the UNK bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be UNK with the wine itself STOP 
START a UNK between an old bottle and an UNK UNK may do as much harm as a week at sea STOP 
START the UNK should be pulled gradually and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward STOP 
START many people use UNK UNK for old red wine UNK the bottle carefully from the UNK into the UNK and eventually to the table without disturbing the UNK STOP 
START another school UNK on such a UNK and UNK that after leaving the UNK an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the UNK to roll to the very bottom after which the bottle may be gently UNK to a tilted position on its side in the UNK STOP 
START in france when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines one visits the restaurant well ahead of time UNK the wines and with the advice of the manager and his UNK UNK the UNK around them STOP 
START the wine UNK will see to it that the bottles are taken from the UNK and opened at least in time to warm and UNK preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and perhaps in the case of very old wines be UNK STOP 
START UNK old wine UNK it fully may also be practically speaking a matter of good economy STOP 
START for in the process of UNK the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table hence a minimum of the UNK mixture of wine and UNK STOP 
START though there are many exceptions which we have noted in preceding pages white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old and red wines nowadays between three and ten STOP 
START red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer average UNK is notably UNK than its opposite number red UNK STOP 
START some UNK do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age or even more STOP 
START if a red UNK of a good name and year is bitter or acid or UNK and UNK leave it alone for a while STOP 
START most of the wines of UNK on the other hand should be drunk while very young UNK may be STOP

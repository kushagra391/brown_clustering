START can UNK war be set off by accident steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of UNK that could trigger the destruction of UNK we as safe as we should be from such a disaster anything being done to increase our UNK of safety the danger increase or decrease have just asked these questions in the pentagon in the white house in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that UNK for months underwater with neat rows of green UNK tubes which contain UNK missiles and which are UNK known as UNK forest STOP 
START i asked the same questions inside the UNK rooms of an atlas missile base in UNK where officers who wear UNK are UNK the commit UNK that could start a war UNK or by design and in the command centers where other UNK men could give orders to push such UNK STOP 
START to the men in the UNK UNK UNK submarine UNK and the UNK UNK rooms that would be the UNK of UNK impersonal UNK wars the questions seem UNK STOP 
START there is UNK pressure but its sources are immediate STOP 
START readiness exercises are almost continuous STOP 
START each could be the real thing STOP 
START in the command centers there are special UNK ready to UNK off the minutes UNK since e hour STOP 
START e stands for execution the moment a go order would UNK an american nuclear strike STOP 
START there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these UNK STOP 
START they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels switches UNK colored lights on pale green or gray UNK that look like business machines STOP 
START they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details STOP 
START UNK war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of UNK complex tasks STOP 
START among the policy makers UNK UNK psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the UNK UNK and their hardware the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's UNK for what the UNK in this field call UNK STOP 
START as an air force UNK put it you can't have dry runs on this one STOP 
START the experts are thus forced to UNK UNK of events that have never occurred probably never will but possibly might STOP 
START only one rule UNK in my UNK with these men the more highly placed they are that is the more they know the more concerned they have become STOP 
START already UNK war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security STOP 
START only recently new holes were discovered in our safety measures and a search is now on for more STOP 
START work is under way to see whether new UNK devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons STOP 
START meanwhile the experts speak of wars UNK by false UNK UNK UNK behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report STOP 
START they UNK a secret world centered on go codes and gold UNK STOP 
START their UNK were almost invariably accompanied by the same UNK arms and pointed UNK UNK toward each other in UNK UNK motions STOP 
START one arm represented our bombers and missiles the other arm theirs STOP 
START yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions perhaps hundreds of millions perhaps you and me and the experts STOP 
START these men are not UNK STOP 
START it is their job to think about the UNK STOP 
START unanimously they believe that the world would become a UNK place if more of us and more russians and communist chinese too thought about UNK war STOP 
START the first systematic thinking about this UNK box within UNK boxes was done four years ago by fred UNK a UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START he was and is with the UNK corporation a UNK pool of UNK financed by the u.s. air force STOP 
START his investigations made him the paul UNK of UNK war and safety procedures were UNK increased STOP 
START in recent weeks as a result of a sweeping defense policy UNK by the kennedy administration basic united states strategy has been modified and large new sums UNK to meet the UNK danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible STOP 
START the chain starts at UNK ballistic missile early warning system in UNK UNK STOP 
START its radar UNK would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states STOP 
START UNK intelligence is simultaneously flashed to UNK north american air defense command in colorado springs colorado for interpretation the UNK command and control post UNK feet below the ground at UNK air force base near UNK UNK the joint war room of the joint UNK of staff in the pentagon and to the president STOP 
START UNK UNK several kinds of radio systems and in some cases television link all vital points STOP 
START alternate locations exist for all key command centers STOP 
START for UNK UNK UNK has alternate command posts on UNK jet UNK STOP 
START multiple UNK UNK and frequencies make the chain as UNK as possible STOP 
START the same principle of UNK applies to all communications on these special networks STOP 
START and no messages can be UNK on these UNK until UNK and UNK UNK in advance by special codes that the messages actually come from their UNK sources STOP 
START additional codes can be used to challenge and UNK the UNK STOP 
START only the president is permitted to UNK the use of nuclear weapons STOP 
START that's the law STOP 
START but what if somebody decides to break it president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger STOP 
START he makes the UNK decision STOP 
START hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the UNK UNK and to push the UNK STOP 
START what if one or more of them turn UNK or suddenly UNK decide to UNK the russians if the president himself in the language of the military goes UNK UNK decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets without UNK can be absolutely certain of the answers STOP 
START however the system is designed UNK and UNK so that no one man could UNK a UNK war STOP 
START even the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order STOP 
START even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike the go code STOP 
START in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the UNK circuit STOP 
START a system of gold actually yellow UNK UNK him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense the joint UNK of staff the UNK commander and other key men STOP 
START all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes STOP 
START all could help the president make his decision STOP 
START the talk would not be in code but neither would it UNK STOP 
START vital questions would be quickly answered according to a UNK UNK STOP 
START officers who participate in the UNK practice UNK assured me that the president's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from aj STOP 
START if communications work his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would UNK the actual go order STOP 
START for these centers too are on the gold circuit STOP 
START they include the navy's atlantic command at UNK virginia which is in contact with the UNK UNK headquarters in europe force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control UNK fighters on ships and land bases UNK which controls long-range bombers and atlas missiles STOP 
START let us look in on one of these nerve centers UNK at UNK and see what must still happen before a wing of UNK bombers could drop their aj STOP 
START in a word plenty STOP 
START the key man almost certainly would be UNK william w. UNK UNK senior UNK STOP 
START he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants all full UNK UNK the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day STOP 
START it is a quiet but impressive room UNK feet long UNK feet wide UNK feet high STOP 
START movable panels of UNK maps and UNK are UNK with intelligence information STOP 
START and bill UNK UNK a UNK son from UNK ohio is a quiet but impressive man STOP 
START his eyes are steady UNK of the deepest brown STOP 
START his movements and speech are precise clear and quick STOP 
START no question UNK him or causes him to UNK STOP 
START UNK who has had the chief UNK job for four years calls the signals for a team operating three rows of UNK UNK UNK with lights switches and UNK STOP 
START at least a dozen men some armed are never far away from him STOP 
START in front of him is a gold phone STOP 
START in UNK the UNK commander gen. thomas power or his deputies and their staff would occupy a UNK that UNK across the length of the room above UNK and his staff STOP 
START at general UNK seat in the UNK there is also a gold phone STOP 
START general power would participate in the decision making STOP 
START UNK below would listen in and act STOP 
START his UNK can give him instant contact with more than UNK bases around the world and with every UNK aircraft STOP 
START he need only pick up one of the two red telephone UNK at his extreme left right next to the big red UNK marked alert STOP 
START there are two UNK in case one should be dropped and UNK STOP 
START but UNK too does not know the go code STOP 
START he must take it from the red box STOP 
START in point of fact this is a UNK box with a bright red door about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to UNK right STOP 
START the box is UNK wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a UNK UNK it's real UNK STOP 
START now we must become vague for we are approaching one of the nation's most UNK secrets STOP 
START the codes in the red box there are several of them covering various UNK are contained in a sealed UNK unique device STOP 
START they are supplied a UNK at a time by a secret source and are continually changed by UNK or his staff at random intervals STOP 
START but even the contents of UNK box cannot start a war STOP 
START they are mere UNK just one portion of UNK messages STOP 
START what these UNK are and how they UNK the go order may not be revealed STOP 
START the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by UNK staff STOP 
START in addition to the UNK and UNK procedures which UNK and follow the sending of the go messages again in special codes each message also contains an internal UNK another specific signal to UNK the UNK that he is getting the real thing STOP 
START i asked UNK what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start UNK one STOP 
START i'd wind up full of bullet holes he said and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his UNK STOP 
START now let us imagine a wing of UNK on alert near their positive control or UNK points the spots on the map many miles from soviet territory beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets STOP 
START they too have UNK of the go code with them STOP 
START as UNK put it they have separate pieces of the pie and we have the whole pie STOP 
START once we send out the whole pie they can put their pieces into it STOP 
START unless we send out the whole pie their pieces mean nothing STOP 
START why does UNK UNK code always UNK with the UNK in possession of the UNK UNK answer is a UNK secret STOP 
START at any rate three men out of a UNK UNK crew are required to copy down UNK UNK message STOP 
START each must match UNK pie with the UNK that he carries with him STOP 
START all three must compare notes and agree to go STOP 
START after that it requires several minutes of concentrated work including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a UNK each with another man beside him to help for an armed bomb to be released STOP 
START unless all UNK are properly operated and the wires and UNK from the UNK removed first no damage can be done STOP

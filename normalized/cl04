START his UNK were UNK by UNK of UNK beard STOP 
START his small mean eyes regarded marty steadily UNK STOP 
START his eyes were UNK by little UNK of red as if tiny UNK had burst and UNK blood into them STOP 
START as he UNK his gum and UNK UNK breath marty UNK the UNK of bad whiskey STOP 
START marty recognized the man STOP 
START he had driven the car that passed them on the road outside UNK place STOP 
START this was UNK UNK proprietor of the UNK joint STOP 
START marty smiled at UNK UNK and said there was a cab waiting for me here STOP 
START do you know where it might have gone UNK his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm STOP 
START he looked straight at marty STOP 
START he did not answer STOP 
START marty UNK the faces of the others nearest him looked into their staring eyes STOP 
START did anyone see my cab asked keeping his voice casual STOP 
START he avoided showing any surprise or UNK when no one answered him STOP 
START i have to get back to UNK he went on STOP 
START i see there are some cars here STOP 
START i wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town be happy to pay for the favor of course STOP 
START the seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer STOP 
START and then a startling thing occurred STOP 
START it was so utterly unexpected that marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open UNK after it had happened STOP 
START there was no word spoken no apparent signal given STOP 
START yet the men all moved at the same instant STOP 
START they piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars UNK off STOP 
START the station wagon and the old plymouth headed east toward UNK STOP 
START the ford and the pickup truck UNK west toward UNK run STOP 
START in seconds all four cars were out of sight STOP 
START marty land stood alone on a UNK road as storm clouds gathered UNK in the sky again STOP 
START from a great distance thunder UNK and broke the silence STOP 
START land looked back toward the UNK house STOP 
START he thought he saw a pale face at a window STOP 
START perhaps it was UNK may STOP 
START perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him STOP 
START there were other UNK nearby STOP 
START across the road there was one no more than a hundred yards away STOP 
START there was another on this side a little further down STOP 
START there were many more between here and UNK STOP 
START telephone poles lined the road STOP 
START they UNK tall and UNK STOP 
START their wires stretched out into UNK STOP 
START not a single UNK of wire reached into the silent houses beside the UNK road STOP 
START there was nothing he could do but walk STOP 
START and UNK was more than three miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a UNK STOP 
START marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road STOP 
START after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned up the UNK of his UNK which were already damp and UNK STOP 
START the UNK mud was UNK and in places great UNK spread across the road and reflected the UNK light STOP 
START as he approached the first UNK thunder sounded behind him again closer now and louder like a steadily UNK drum corps STOP 
START there were several people on the porch of the UNK STOP 
START there was a very old man and a young woman and a UNK of children ranging from UNK to teen-agers STOP 
START for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help STOP 
START perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town STOP 
START then he realized the utter UNK of the idea STOP 
START they were staring at him in the same blank and UNK way that the men outside the gate had stared STOP 
START even the eyes of the smallest children seemed UNK STOP 
START on his side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning against a plow STOP 
START they too stared at him STOP 
START the drums of thunder were right behind him now STOP 
START a foolish thought came into his head STOP 
START he remembered a story he had read as a youth STOP 
START it was probably one of UNK tales of the british army STOP 
START it concerned an officer who had been UNK and UNK out STOP 
START the steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded and each man UNK and turned his back as the officer approached STOP 
START marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs STOP 
START the UNK by the UNK ended STOP 
START now the dirt highway was UNK on either side by a fairly deep drainage UNK too broad to leap over unless you were an UNK star STOP 
START the day's rain had been added to the UNK water STOP 
START he was UNK on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car STOP 
START it was coming toward him STOP 
START the car was now in sight STOP 
START UNK heart UNK a beat when he recognized it STOP 
START it was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the UNK farm STOP 
START UNK UNK station wagon STOP 
START it had headed back toward UNK STOP 
START that had only been a UNK to UNK him out on the deserted road STOP 
START now UNK and his friends were returning to seek him out STOP 
START the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him beside a UNK field STOP 
START then there was another sound STOP 
START a second car was coming from the west from the direction of UNK run STOP 
START it was the ford that had been outside UNK farm STOP 
START marty looked UNK in both directions STOP 
START it was a narrow road barely wide enough for two cars to pass STOP 
START he could not leave the road because of the UNK drainage UNK STOP 
START when the two cars were UNK from him the station wagon started up again and the ford gathered speed STOP 
START they bore down on him STOP 
START there was nothing he could do except jump into the UNK STOP 
START he jumped and sank to his knees in UNK water STOP 
START as the two cars roared by there was a UNK UNK UNK sound STOP 
START marty knew how the union soldiers must have felt at UNK and UNK and UNK when the UNK gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild UNK UNK they called the rebel UNK STOP 
START for moments he stood in water shivering and UNK for breath STOP 
START he had turned his UNK slightly and it UNK him STOP 
START the cars with their load of UNK men had disappeared in the distance STOP 
START there had been two more cars parked at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck STOP 
START they would be coming for him next bearing down on him from both directions STOP 
START and then the station wagon and the ford would seek him out again STOP 
START he would be UNK repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to UNK STOP 
START he still had three miles to go STOP 
START back east the more UNK juvenile UNK who could afford UNK UNK instead of switch blades as UNK weapons played this same game and called it chicken STOP 
START he could not go through the fields STOP 
START that way was UNK on both sides of the road by a high UNK fence STOP 
START he had to make for the section of road just ahead that was UNK by the rail fence the section by the UNK STOP 
START at least he could climb up on the fence when his UNK roared by again STOP 
START the UNK place could not be far now STOP 
START he would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest STOP 
START there was even a bare chance that the phone had not been UNK STOP 
START he did not dare climb back up to the road STOP 
START he was deep in water but at least they could not reach him there STOP 
START he UNK on mud UNK at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage UNK and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm STOP 
START he climbed back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted STOP 
START he stood UNK for a moment STOP 
START and then he saw something that he had not seen before and panic gripped him again STOP 
START the fence his only UNK when the metal death came UNK at him was made of UNK all right but the UNK were protected by a thick UNK of barbed wire that would UNK his flesh if he pressed against it STOP 
START he UNK on down the road UNK because there was no place else to go STOP 
START he lost all sense of dignity STOP 
START you could not stand on dignity when you were UNK and UNK and your life was at stake STOP 
START probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this UNK too but he did not bother to look STOP 
START he broke into a UNK breathing heavily UNK with sweat STOP 
START he had to reach UNK place STOP 
START it was his only UNK STOP 
START the fences on both sides of the road UNK with the barbed wire STOP 
START the fences stretched on UNK STOP 
START and then he heard them STOP 
START and now he saw them STOP 
START the plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west STOP 
START they had UNK it better this time STOP 
START they would reach him at almost exactly the same instant STOP 
START he stopped UNK STOP 
START if he backed against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he would be UNK UNK by the wire STOP 
START he stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect target STOP 
START the cars must have had their gas UNK pushed down to the floor boards STOP 
START they were coming on at UNK speed for such old vehicles STOP 
START they UNK at him STOP 
START he held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible STOP 
START when the plymouth UNK it UNK toward him and seemed about to run him down STOP 
START he forced himself to stay frozen there STOP 
START if he moved he would be in the path of the other car STOP 
START he thought the UNK of the plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by STOP 
START in a fraction of a second the pickup truck UNK by on the other side STOP 
START the UNK insane sound of the rebel UNK UNK again and UNK from the distant hills STOP 
START he did not leave the middle of the road STOP 
START he did not try to run STOP 
START he UNK on his UNK eyes focused straight ahead STOP 
START he was nearing the UNK house STOP 
START he was going to make it he told himself STOP 
START and then he heard a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and weep STOP 
START oh no not again he said aloud STOP 
START not again so soon STOP 
START there was a new sound a sound as UNK as the rebel UNK yet different STOP 
START it was the sound of a UNK STOP 
START now he saw that the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms UNK STOP 
START it was the UNK car from the UNK office STOP 
START the car drew up alongside him and stopped STOP 
START get in UNK UNK said UNK STOP 
START he staggered into the back seat and lay back fighting for breath STOP 
START there was someone in front with the sheriff STOP 
START it was pete holmes the UNK STOP 
START pete turned around and said to marty i guess you think i'm a UNK UNK STOP 
START but there wasn't no use in me staying there STOP 
START i couldn't fight a dozen or so of 'em STOP 
START if i'd stayed all that i'd have got was four UNK tires and one UNK head STOP 
START why didn't you wait at the UNK house UNK known i'd gone to get the sheriff STOP 
START i was lucky they let me go i guess STOP 
START the sheriff was occupied with UNK the car around in a very narrow space STOP 
START when it was finally pointed east he said you should never have come out here alone STOP 
START this is UNK country STOP 
START every man in every one of these houses is a night rider STOP

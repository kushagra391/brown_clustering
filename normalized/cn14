START while no larger than dutch springs this mining supply town had the appearance of being far UNK and more UNK STOP 
START men crowded the streets and freight UNK and teams were moving about STOP 
START although they were forced to maintain a UNK watch this activity enabled them to ride in and UNK their UNK without any particular attention being paid them STOP 
START UNK be UNK forth in some bar if he's here at all cobb declared UNK along the street as they stretched their legs STOP 
START there were no less than six or seven UNK in UNK not counting the lower class UNK all UNK for the trade of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START pat only nodded STOP 
START take one side of the street and i'll take the other he proposed STOP 
START if you spot UNK give a UNK before you move in STOP 
START UNK UNK was tight STOP 
START you do the same STOP 
START it's all i ask stevens STOP 
START UNK they took different sides of the main drag and UNK UNK the bars STOP 
START russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero STOP 
START suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate UNK UNK so casually even were he to prove the UNK STOP 
START he UNK out of the UNK rest with his hopes UNK and headed UNK for the palace saloon the last place of any consequence on this side of the street STOP 
START the palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on UNK in front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch STOP 
START behind its UNK UNK the UNK dive clung like a UNK nest to the UNK ribs of the UNK STOP 
START russ ran up the steps quickly to the UNK porch STOP 
START the front windows of the place were long and narrow reaching nearly to the floor and UNK an unusually good view of the interior STOP 
START heading for the UNK cobb glanced UNK through the nearest window and suddenly UNK aside STOP 
START nerves tight as a UNK he paused to gather his UNK STOP 
START against all expectation UNK was inside clearly enjoying himself to the UNK and already so UNK that it seemed unlikely he was UNK to note anything or anyone about him STOP 
START UNK anger UNK through russ STOP 
START he fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious UNK on the spot STOP 
START reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he UNK UNK the busy street below STOP 
START stevens was nowhere in sight STOP 
START UNK an UNK russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down STOP 
START as luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before pat appeared STOP 
START what luck cobb said swiftly STOP 
START russ pointed upward STOP 
START he's there he got out UNK UNK his rising excitement STOP 
START UNK his UNK belt around pat glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb at his side STOP 
START climbing the steps steadily they reached the top and headed for the door STOP 
START pat pushed through first STOP 
START forced behind him UNK russ followed at once and halted two steps inside STOP 
START his eyes UNK STOP 
START while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy UNK with UNK UNK a prominent figure it was now as UNK and dull as the day before UNK STOP 
START UNK himself was nowhere to be seen STOP 
START a man knocked the UNK ball about UNK in its track and another UNK at one of the card tables STOP 
START two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar while the UNK UNK UNK polished a glass STOP 
START looking the UNK over stevens started UNK for the rear of the place STOP 
START where UNK UNK was the UNK STOP 
START UNK pat turned to survey him deliberately STOP 
START he did not reply going on toward the back STOP 
START less assured than the tall UNK man in the lead cobb followed UNK a hand on his gun butt STOP 
START the UNK measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it STOP 
START he said no more STOP 
START a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an UNK STOP 
START pat moved into it STOP 
START small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side STOP 
START all the doors were open at this hour except one and it was toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder STOP 
START the door was locked STOP 
START a single kick made it spring open UNK STOP 
START pat saw UNK UNK UNK forward a UNK bottle UNK as if to strike STOP 
START russ sprang through to bat it UNK aside STOP 
START with a UNK UNK UNK at him STOP 
START but he was more than UNK and his UNK were UNK STOP 
START cobb UNK a single powerful UNK that sent UNK UNK wildly and UNK down with a UNK UNK STOP 
START he started to struggle up UNK desperately STOP 
START russ gave him a UNK thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach STOP 
START UNK cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him UNK STOP 
START okay stevens STOP 
START i've drawn his UNK he snapped STOP 
START go through his pockets will you we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of UNK pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing STOP 
START cobb watched this with UNK eyes his desperate hope UNK by the moment STOP 
START stevens was UNK over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly rose and UNK toward UNK hat which had tumbled UNK feet away when he first fell STOP 
START cobb got it STOP 
START UNK up his eyes UNK he held out the UNK UNK STOP 
START look at this the crown UNK behind the stained UNK could be seen thin UNK UNK of currency STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK for his UNK had been found STOP 
START by UNK stevens were right russ exclaimed UNK the loose bills out of UNK hat STOP 
START that is if we can be sure this is UNK money pat UNK STOP 
START where else would he get it what you've got there cobb STOP 
START we can soon tell STOP 
START russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any UNK would come by honestly STOP 
START pat nodded STOP 
START it's within a hundred of what UNK had he declared STOP 
START we know penny spent some and UNK must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on STOP 
START UNK the money over russ wiped his hands on his UNK as if UNK himself of something UNK STOP 
START his glance at UNK UNK was UNK STOP 
START shall we get out of here the card room they moved back through the palace the way they had come STOP 
START UNK looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt to UNK them STOP 
START UNK in the outside door to glance behind him pat looked his UNK warning and stepped out STOP 
START he and cobb UNK down the high steps to the street STOP 
START neither spoke till they reached their horses STOP 
START pat paused there looking across at the young fellow STOP 
START it'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to UNK and tell him about it russ STOP 
START he started to return it STOP 
START to his faint surprise russ held up his hand STOP 
START not me he ruled UNK STOP 
START i've had enough STOP 
START it was you that UNK it down anyway stevens he pursued strictly STOP 
START i'll UNK along home STOP 
START whatever you say STOP 
START pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed his UNK UNK STOP 
START you UNK it to penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you really he observed UNK STOP 
START old UNK wasn't UNK cobb UNK STOP 
START he'll know when you tell him STOP 
START but i want this to sink in UNK STOP 
START then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger STOP 
START pat had never UNK to give advice in such affairs STOP 
START you're the doctor he returned with a smile STOP 
START but i still think UNK an awful nice girl russ you don't have to tell me flashed cobb STOP 
START giving the other a dark look he UNK his UNK around and UNK down off the street STOP 
START pat let him go following more UNK STOP 
START at the first restaurant he UNK pulled up to go in for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the UNK for UNK STOP 
START the truth was the UNK was both UNK and UNK by his own mixed luck STOP 
START UNK always glad to see me over there he UNK UNK STOP 
START yet had he not visited the girl at saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest UNK STOP 
START over and above that however was his growing suspicion of chuck UNK part in recent events STOP 
START UNK UNK couldn't have known about UNK money unless he was told and who else would have told him asked himself STOP 
START it's the second time war UNK hands made a play for that money STOP 
START how much of an accident could that be home he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun STOP 
START in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot on the range UNK had a meaning STOP 
START UNK up russ listened carefully STOP 
START two minutes later it came again a double explosion followed by a third UNK more distant STOP 
START as near as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the UNK ranch house STOP 
START he UNK up in a UNK STOP 
START so far as he knew only his father could be there STOP 
START what did it mean UNK to the UNK he set off at a sharp UNK with growing alarm STOP 
START his first glimpse of the ranch house across the UNK UNK told him nothing STOP 
START still a UNK away the fresh UNK of guns only served to increase his speed STOP 
START setting a course straight for the house he was covering ground fast when an angry bee UNK past close to his face STOP 
START when it was followed by a second UNK even closer cobb UNK sharply aside into a depression STOP 
START he knew now what he was up against STOP 
START whoever was out there hiding in the UNK cover was UNK the UNK house and having spotted his approach was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight STOP 
START UNK himself for having UNK out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly STOP 
START if he wondered whether the UNK would allow him to pull away UNK he had his answer a moment later STOP 
START over this way ain't gone far harsh cry UNK to him across the brush STOP 
START a UNK cracked more loudly and a UNK UNK UNK from the brush off at one side STOP 
START the UNK UNK had his position figured pretty close STOP 
START UNK russ looked about hastily STOP 
START toward the west this depression led toward a draw STOP 
START leading his UNK he hurried that way not UNK till he was well below the level of the surrounding range STOP 
START swinging up then and UNK forward over the horn he urged his mount down the UNK draw STOP 
START he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind STOP 
START he had been UNK and his UNK UNK shot after shot STOP 
START a shot or two went wild before cobb felt something UNK at his foot STOP 
START a UNK had torn half of his UNK away STOP 
START a second UNK his UNK and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm STOP 
START another UNK close overhead STOP 
START UNK UNK get out of here the first shot russ had UNK his mount to the left toward the side of the UNK draw STOP 
START the long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless STOP 
START sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment STOP 
START he heard UNK from behind him but he could make out no words STOP 
START he UNK UNK for the next UNK turn in the draw and made it STOP 
START UNK UNK the UNK UNK into an UNK draw he plunged forward with UNK speed STOP 
START gradually the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range STOP 
START yet he must chance it STOP 
START he UNK out of the UNK wash the loose dirt flying behind him and flashed a look about STOP

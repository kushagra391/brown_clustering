START spencer said nothing STOP 
START is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense shook his head STOP 
START alexander said answer me properly spencer STOP 
START spencer was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing i want to say captain STOP 
START very well STOP 
START alexander walked away STOP 
START naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor STOP 
START philip spencer had UNK planned the murder of his captain yet it seemed in order to UNK him for a UNK of proper address STOP 
START during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no UNK effect upon the men of the UNK STOP 
START those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to UNK UNK under UNK of some call of duty so as to be near spencer watching an opportunity to communicate with him STOP 
START hostile UNK were flashed at both alexander and UNK STOP 
START the two met in the UNK cabin STOP 
START what is the next step captain more UNK i fear STOP 
START in your opinion who is this e. UNK on the certain list cromwell of course STOP 
START he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot STOP 
START he saw the dangers not the UNK of being identified as a UNK STOP 
START somehow he talked spencer into letting him use another name STOP 
START there was a tap at the door and UNK entered with the word that UNK wished to see the captain STOP 
START have him come in STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK brought the UNK news that the UNK UNK and UNK had been UNK removed from their customary places STOP 
START and also sir two articles which were considered UNK now must be regarded in another light entirely STOP 
START an african knife and UNK are at this moment being UNK by mckinley and green STOP 
START mckinley was UNK to say that he would like to get the knife into UNK possession and that where did you gather all this information UNK reported to you the UNK of UNK and UNK and who he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder with UNK and UNK behind him STOP 
START a glance revealed that the main UNK UNK had been carried away STOP 
START the UNK milling about of what had been a UNK UNK crew struck alexander with horror STOP 
START he UNK orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned their heads UNK toward the UNK figure as though for further instruction STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK to UNK side STOP 
START small violently jerked the UNK brace with full intention to carry away the UNK STOP 
START i saw him myself and it was done after UNK with cromwell STOP 
START i UNK it sir STOP 
START and it was clear that UNK was not mistaken for both small and cromwell took no step toward UNK in the sending up of the new UNK UNK till philip spencer had given the signal to UNK STOP 
START then with disappointment evident upon their faces they moved to the work STOP 
START alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and UNK STOP 
START their strategy was sound enough and he UNK had been defeated only by philip UNK UNK to sanction an idea he had not originated STOP 
START when the UNK was raised alexander gave the order for small and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in UNK sprawled upon the open deck and terror UNK the UNK STOP 
START UNK potential followers were openly UNK and UNK missing UNK without excuse expressing in ominous tones their UNK at the prisoners being kept in UNK UNK with the three by glance and signal STOP 
START one of the missing UNK came out of its hiding place after UNK UNK had been UNK UNK by UNK wilson STOP 
START UNK had reported the man to UNK and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson UNK the weapon STOP 
START wilson UNK and UNK was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green UNK and mckinley STOP 
START not a man on the UNK loyal or UNK could be UNK by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of UNK STOP 
START in the tiny cabin alexander met with UNK UNK and UNK to speak and to listen STOP 
START three days had passed since UNK arrest and each day had brought new dangers new fears STOP 
START UNK said it requires an UNK eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely STOP 
START to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed STOP 
START from actions aboard it is easy to guess that UNK UNK of twenty UNK followers was a modest estimate STOP 
START well UNK UNK why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and that would be worse than useless alexander broke in STOP 
START there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners STOP 
START besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will be UNK but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order STOP 
START mr. UNK does this sound like a truly UNK plan to you you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now said of course they would STOP 
START they are about to do so at any moment as it is STOP 
START all that is needed is for one man to feel UNK enough to take the lead STOP 
START as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed STOP 
START we are going to be rushed and UNK STOP 
START that is UNK language mr. UNK STOP 
START we are not going to be rushed and UNK alexander said STOP 
START we are going to bring the UNK into new york harbor safe and sound STOP 
START of course i agree with the captain UNK said thoughtfully but the conspiracy is UNK and desperate STOP 
START the instinct of discipline has been lost STOP 
START anything is possible when UNK has the upper hand STOP 
START he paused then added everything on a ship is a weapon STOP 
START UNK of wood and iron are available for close and UNK combat no matter where a man stands STOP 
START and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many STOP 
START we ourselves must stand UNK STOP 
START alexander said STOP 
START under arms day and night watch and watch about STOP 
START those of us present the UNK brothers UNK and the other UNK now have the responsibility of the UNK STOP 
START a great deal of labor we have as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed STOP 
START and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his head into his arms and UNK for he knew full well what must be done what in the end would be done STOP 
START with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy's UNK laws STOP 
START and when he did when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor he knew he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicated his soul STOP 
START where had he failed had he failed who had tried so hard who had UNK so UNK to be a great officer STOP 
START it came to him as he UNK there aboard the UNK that it was as foolish to UNK for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven STOP 
START it was given or it was not given STOP 
START one did one's best and if fortune smiled there was a reward STOP 
START one did one's best and if fortune UNK an UNK boy with murder in his heart UNK aboard one's ship STOP 
START and alexander UNK like a girl for the dreams he had had and he felt no shame STOP 
START god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with an UNK rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career STOP 
START another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any UNK STOP 
START it was for love that he had served the navy STOP 
START to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for STOP 
START now the hope was gone STOP 
START yes he would bring the UNK safely into new york harbor but at a price STOP 
START dear god at what a price STOP 
START and after a while he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity STOP 
START UNK he UNK the prisoners satisfying himself that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason STOP 
START the prisoners UNK their eyes but not before he had UNK hatred and anger STOP 
START only cromwell the giant UNK was UNK and UNK STOP 
START he said captain may i speak please i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship STOP 
START are you cromwell yes sir STOP 
START before god i UNK i am innocent STOP 
START i know nothing of any plot if there is such a thing STOP 
START you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt STOP 
START i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent STOP 
START he leaned closer to alexander UNK up at him from the deck STOP 
START surely captain you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything STOP 
START no cromwell i did not find your name STOP 
START you were careful about that STOP 
START now spencer seeming with effort to shake himself from UNK spoke STOP 
START he said cromwell is telling you the truth STOP 
START he is innocent STOP 
START alexander shifted his gaze to spencer STOP 
START the UNK and UNK of his tone suggested UNK of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell STOP 
START alexander knew spencer too well to think him naive or UNK STOP 
START and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized a UNK with spencer STOP 
START here was another human who understood the UNK of UNK with the inevitable STOP 
START there was good fortune and there was bad and philip spencer in UNK and UNK UNK knew it to be a truth STOP 
START he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for UNK STOP 
START the UNK captain towering above the UNK as a symbol of UNK and authority was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer STOP 
START this tragic UNK had UNK his own UNK STOP 
START but he could not have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him STOP 
START and because fortune had favored neither the UNK nor the UNK captain they would be each UNK UNK STOP 
START spencer if there is guilt if you do not deny your own how is it possible for cromwell to be innocent was your constant companion STOP 
START the UNK eyes met UNK STOP 
START i tell you he is innocent STOP 
START and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word yes STOP 
START i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell STOP 
START nothing to lose either spencer STOP 
START that's true spencer agreed and UNK himself from the conversation STOP 
START his eyes went back to UNK of the sea STOP 
START i am innocent captain cromwell said again STOP 
START before god captain i am innocent STOP 
START and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not UNK to speak an UNK still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell STOP 
START the UNK was as guilty as any STOP 
START no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four UNK prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper had seen it in UNK hands while spencer whispered explanations STOP 
START i thought UNK UNK had told alexander that spencer was teaching him UNK STOP 
START it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in UNK to the UNK where a class of UNK UNK him STOP 
START this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of UNK UNK here which alexander recognized STOP 
START some of these UNK were in physical strength already men and doubtless a percentage of them were UNK followers STOP

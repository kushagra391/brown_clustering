START the group upon the UNK of its first press release on december 21 1957 designated itself a committee of investigation STOP 
START in the course of its inquiry it took testimony from only seven witnesses STOP 
START it heard bang-jensen twice and his lawyer UNK a. UNK jr. once STOP 
START its second press release was on january 15 1958 and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed STOP 
START it also implied that paul bang-jensen had been UNK STOP 
START on january 18 UNK gross conducted a press conference at the u.n. lasting an hour STOP 
START here he openly attacked bang-jensen and referred to his UNK conduct STOP 
START this conference was held despite UNK assurance to UNK UNK who was leaving the same day for puerto rico that nothing would be done until his return on january 22 except that the secretary general would probably order the list destroyed STOP 
START on january 24 paul bang-jensen accompanied by UNK UNK was met by UNK UNK and colonel frank UNK former police chief of UNK UNK and now head of u.n. special police STOP 
START the four UNK in UNK mounted to the UNK roof of the u.n. there UNK lit a fire in a wire basket and bang-jensen dropped four sealed UNK into the flames STOP 
START in one of these he said were notes on the UNK of the UNK UNK STOP 
START the method of destroying the evidence UNK paul bang-jensen STOP 
START he knew it would be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence STOP 
START he was right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew UNK words on the subject well it seemed as good a place as any to do the job STOP 
START the gross group had been formed for the express purpose of UNK the secretary general STOP 
START UNK supposed desire to seek outside legal advice in the UNK of UNK gross is illusion at best STOP 
START UNK being outside the u.n. applied only to a physical state not an objective one STOP 
START but by the time the papers were finally disposed of the group had informed the world of its purpose its recommendations and its belief that paul bang-jensen was not of sound mind STOP 
START shortly the group would issue its report to the secretary general UNK paul UNK UNK from the united nations STOP 
START the contents of this UNK document would become known to many before it would become known to the man it was written about STOP 
START until this UNK committee matter came up bang-jensen was a fine and devoted individual STOP 
START i had known him for some years when i was a UNK and before and this manner had never been his STOP 
START UNK a. gross leaned back in his chair and told peter marshall how secretary general UNK hammarskjold had on december 4 1957 called him in as a private lawyer to review UNK conduct relating to his association with the special committee on the problem of UNK STOP 
START the result was the gross report prepared by gross as chairman with the assistance of two u.n. under UNK UNK UNK and UNK de UNK STOP 
START yes gross went on bang-jensen was an UNK young man STOP 
START he had always done well STOP 
START never well known but he had done his work UNK STOP 
START gross had received marshall UNK and they were discussing the case STOP 
START you know the lawyer said it's difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back STOP 
START gross was behind a UNK desk only a UNK UNK before him STOP 
START marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs STOP 
START outside the office windows twenty-four stories above wall street a light rain was falling STOP 
START mr. gross your report says that our function is UNK and advisory and does not in any way UNK from or prejudice mr. UNK rights as a staff member STOP 
START you know bang-jensen characterized your committee as having UNK his case STOP 
START gross swung his UNK chair STOP 
START well how could that have been don't consider that he was UNK STOP 
START we were given a job and we carried it out and later his case was taken up by the UNK committee STOP 
START we have nothing to hide under a UNK STOP 
START we did our job mr. UNK and mr. de UNK and myself taking evidence from a number of people STOP 
START what did you think about his mental state i think our report sums up our finding gross answered STOP 
START don't forget here was a man who had been UNK his colleagues for almost a year of UNK attempting to present an UNK report STOP 
START this was not merely UNK errors but was carried out by UNK UNK in UNK written charges of serious consequence STOP 
START this is a UNK thing STOP 
START UNK you or i were being accused in this manner and yet we were doing our level best to carry on our work STOP 
START no organization can carry on like that STOP 
START i've been in government and i can tell some pretty UNK stories about personnel difficulties so i know what a problem he was STOP 
START what i'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled at your committee STOP 
START what do you mean for instance regarding the fact that the gross committee issued two interim UNK to the press during its investigation STOP 
START you know bang-jensen was told the committee was to convey its views suggestions and recommendations to the secretary general STOP 
START in his own words bang-jensen took it for granted that the group would report to the secretary general privately and not in public STOP 
START he claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was UNK to his position STOP 
START gross UNK STOP 
START for an instant he UNK UNK at marshall STOP 
START listen he said STOP 
START i thought the entire report was going to be UNK from beginning to end STOP 
START but you know bang-jensen launched an active campaign against us in the press STOP 
START it was getting so that we the committee were being tried STOP 
START you can find it in the papers STOP 
START well as a matter of fact i've looked through UNK files of new york papers for december 1957 and haven't found a great deal gross shot another look at marshall STOP 
START it wasn't necessarily all here in new york STOP 
START don't forget the foreign press STOP 
START then what about the second interim public announcement cited UNK UNK conduct STOP 
START the reason for that report was to settle the matter of the list STOP 
START as far as i'm concerned it was a separate matter from the general committee study of UNK conduct STOP 
START the january fifteen report recommended that bang-jensen be instructed to burn the list the papers in the presence of a u.n. security officer STOP 
START how about your press conference three days later what was the reason for that said you told UNK that you had checked in advance to make sure the term UNK conduct was not UNK STOP 
START he claimed you made other UNK UNK STOP 
START gross paused and repeated himself STOP 
START the entire object of the press conference was to clarify the problem of the list since many in the press were UNK the u.n. about it STOP 
START what was the list don't know STOP 
START bang-jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that he had in his possession STOP 
START it was foolish of him to keep them whatever they were STOP 
START he could have been UNK or his family might have been threatened STOP 
START of course the matter caught the UNK attention STOP 
START we attempted to conclude this and did so by having the papers burned STOP 
START hammarskjold didn't like the way it was carried out STOP 
START it was a sort of UNK affair STOP 
START hammarskjold believes the u.n. is an organization that UNK matters in a UNK way STOP 
START peter marshall reflected STOP 
START if hammarskjold had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner and if bang-jensen had not wanted it who had ordered it mr. gross concerning the formation of your committee there's the fact that you have been a legal UNK to the u.n. in the past i understand it mr. hammarskjold wanted outside advice STOP 
START could you comment on that i've served as a counsel for the u.n. for some years UNK particularly in real estate matters or other problems that the regular u.n. legal staff might not be equipped to handle STOP 
START mr. UNK is the u.n. legal chief and a very good man but he is not fully UNK on some technical points of american law STOP 
START what did you think about UNK UNK of errors and UNK in the UNK report asked STOP 
START those answered STOP 
START why UNK UNK went over and over the report with UNK UNK trying to check them out STOP 
START even after the incident between bang-jensen and UNK in the UNK UNK and this was not the way the chicago tribune presented it STOP 
START gross reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper UNK STOP 
START one was an article on the u.n. by alice UNK from the UNK UNK STOP 
START the other was by UNK UNK in the chicago daily tribune STOP 
START gross pointed to the UNK story STOP 
START i know UNK he's a friend of mine STOP 
START he probably didn't mean to write it this way or maybe he did STOP 
START there wasn't any violent argument between bang-jensen and UNK as the tribune puts it STOP 
START that implies that UNK was on the enemy side STOP 
START you see what i mean it's UNK there the word violent STOP 
START the case was that bang-jensen came up to UNK claiming he had found further errors in the report STOP 
START i've found errors and i want you to look them over STOP 
START so once again UNK had to argue with him about this STOP 
START but it wasn't a violent discussion STOP 
START and after all this UNK went over all that bang-jensen had brought up STOP 
START UNK own report peter marshall reflected describes the encounter as UNK STOP 
START bang-jensen was in UNK condition STOP 
START gross stopped briefly then went on STOP 
START UNK was responsible for the report STOP 
START he has felt terrible about all this STOP 
START it was a good report he did all he could to make it a good report STOP 
START when i speak of how UNK felt i know well STOP 
START don't forget i am an old member of the club a former UNK STOP 
START i think you are being unfair to take these things up now STOP 
START you know this hits in many areas STOP 
START it appeals to those who were UNK in the outcome of the UNK situation STOP 
START don't forget the u.n. did no more than the united states did STOP 
START it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to get the impact of this fact STOP 
START chapter 22 from the home of his friend UNK UNK in washington d.c. paul bang-jensen sent a UNK dated december 9 1957 to UNK gross STOP 
START it said in part the matters to be considered are obviously of a grave character and i therefore UNK request that the hearing be UNK for two weeks in order that i might make adequate preparation STOP 
START UNK gross replied the next day putting the suspended UNK fears to rest STOP 
START this reveals some misunderstanding on your part STOP 
START the group conducting the review is not holding formal UNK STOP 
START it wished to pursue in the course of this review questions arising from the body of material already in its possession STOP 
START it sounded like a fair enough invitation peter marshall reflected and bang-jensen must have thought so too because on the UNK he met the group of three on the UNK floor of the u.n. STOP 
START there UNK gross further assured him we were requested by the secretary general as i understand it to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the UNK STOP 
START the only rules which i think we shall follow will be those of common sense justice and UNK STOP 
START peter marshall noted that bang-jensen had later referred to his two interviews with the gross group as unfortunate experiences and after his second meeting on the sixteenth the UNK refused to attend further UNK without legal counsel STOP 
START marshall UNK the reason for this and UNK too the replacement of one member of the UNK group STOP 
START j. a. c. UNK after serving gross one week left for england STOP

START it will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages UNK in table 1 STOP 
START great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network STOP 
START by monitoring we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers STOP 
START as a word of caution we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types question command statement or UNK STOP 
START for example suppose a man wearing a UNK watch driving a 1959 rolls UNK UNK to ask a man on the sidewalk what time is it sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the UNK has UNK the fact that he has no faith in his own UNK or the one attached to his car STOP 
START if the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question it has served as an UNK STOP 
START also since the man questioned feels a strong UNK to answer and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought UNK the question has assumed some UNK properties of a command STOP 
START however for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to table 1 STOP 
START on this basis certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for UNK purposes STOP 
START networks UNK some special types of organization the cocktail party STOP 
START presumably a cocktail party is expected to UNK the UNK desire to get together a number of people who are UNK acquainted and thereby UNK for bringing the level of UNK up to UNK for future cooperative UNK STOP 
START the party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another STOP 
START the information is furnished by each of the guests is sent by oral UNK over the air waves and is received by the ears STOP 
START since the air is a UNK the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points the people in the net STOP 
START as shown in figure 1 there is a connection for communication between every pair of points STOP 
START this and other qualifications make the cocktail party the most complete and most UNK communication system ever dreamed up STOP 
START all four types of message listed in table 1 are permitted although UNK and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum while UNK having UNK UNK are more than UNK encouraged STOP 
START the UNK of the connections provide that for n people there are af lines of communication between the pairs which can become a large number UNK for a party of fifty guests STOP 
START looking at the UNK we see that af connection lines come in to each member STOP 
START thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system but there is one weakness STOP 
START in spite of the dreams of the host for UNK in the group the af UNK messages for each guest UNK his receiving system beyond UNK if n UNK about six STOP 
START the crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six with a UNK for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes STOP 
START for the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored UNK then the open house system is UNK because the honored guests are fixed UNK points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door STOP 
START the rural community STOP 
START we consider a rural community as an UNK of UNK UNK whose UNK is determined by the location and size of the UNK land sites necessary for family UNK STOP 
START we assume for this illustration that the size of the land UNK is so great that the distance between UNK is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only as shown in figure 2 STOP 
START information beyond nearest neighbor is carried UNK UNK and UNK as a UNK UNK STOP 
START in figure 2 the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number STOP 
START the numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors STOP 
START it will be noted that point f has seven nearest neighbors h and e have six and p has only one while the remaining points have intermediate numbers STOP 
START in any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors a point like f in figure 2 would other things being equal be the dwelling place for the community leader while e and h would house the next most important citizens STOP 
START a point like p gets information directly from n but all information beyond n is indirectly UNK through n STOP 
START the UNK at p is last to hear about a new cure the UNK to announce to his neighbors his urgent UNK the one who goes the UNK to trade and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort STOP 
START since the UNK of poor communication are so great p can be justified as a UNK site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a UNK for milling purposes a mine or a sugar UNK camp STOP 
START location UNK have given these matters much consideration STOP 
START military organizations STOP 
START the networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war STOP 
START they also furnish proof that in modern war message sending must be UNK STOP 
START without monitoring a military UNK becomes a UNK party STOP 
START the need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military UNK STOP 
START alexander the great who used UNK as message carriers did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once STOP 
START as time has passed and science has progressed the speed of military vehicles has increased the range of missiles has been extended the use of UNK UNK on the UNK has been adopted and the range and UNK of message sending has increased STOP 
START next to the old problem of the UNK of decision making network structure seems to be UNK and without monitoring no network has value STOP 
START on the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in figure 3 STOP 
START the monitoring is the highest and most UNK of any organization in existence STOP 
START no questions statements or explanations are permitted only commands STOP 
START commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank STOP 
START the same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to UNK STOP 
START all orders UNK with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks STOP 
START even the officer in charge be it a captain for small display or a general is restrained by monitoring STOP 
START this is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden UNK up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility STOP 
START the commands are specified by the military regulations few in number briefly UNK all different in sound are UNK into UNK which permit any marching UNK that could be desired on a parade ground STOP 
START this monitoring is necessary because on a parade ground everyone can hear too much and without monitoring a confused social event would develop STOP 
START with troops UNK on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication STOP 
START years ago this was true but with the replacement of wires or UNK by radio and radar and perhaps television these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard STOP 
START in contrast to cocktail parties military organizations even in the field are more formal STOP 
START in the extreme and UNK example suggested in figure 3 the organization is more easily understood and more UNK in behavior STOP 
START a military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command STOP 
START this objective is UNK to throughout the duration of the action STOP 
START the UNK system or network is UNK to meet the requirements of the objective and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory a college or a rural village STOP 
START the assumptions upon which the example shown in figure 3 is based are a one man can direct about six UNK if the UNK are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal UNK UNK etc. STOP 
START b a message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be UNK more than about six UNK times STOP 
START c decisions of a general kind are made by the central command STOP 
START and d all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is UNK to the line of men on the lower rank STOP 
START these assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top six directly under him six under each of these and so on until there are six levels of personnel STOP 
START the number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of UNK men STOP 
START this UNK network would be of no UNK if there were no regulations UNK to the types of message sent STOP 
START of types of message listed in table 1 commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in figure 3 STOP 
START a further regulation is that commands always go down UNK by statements and statements always go up UNK by commands STOP 
START questions and particularly UNK are usually UNK along informal UNK lines not indicated in figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor STOP 
START it will readily be seen that in this suggested network not UNK different from some of the networks in UNK today greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice STOP 
START furthermore the network in figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks UNK to UNK and the like are UNK STOP 
START not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as UNK warfare where the UNK sending UNK and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the UNK STOP 
START such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to UNK primitive UNK for what they could teach STOP 
START a team for useful research STOP 
START this is an UNK problem which probably has never been seriously investigated although one frequently UNK the comment that we have UNK specialists of the kind who can compete with the germans or swiss for example in precision machinery and mathematics or the UNK in UNK STOP 
START we hear equally UNK concern over the belief that we have not enough UNK who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes STOP 
START this problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of UNK and specialists can be investigated on a UNK network basis STOP 
START since the difficulty of drawing the net is great we will merely discuss it STOP 
START first we realize that a pure specialist does not exist STOP 
START but for practical purposes we have people who can be considered as such STOP 
START for example there are persons who are in physical science in the field of UNK trained in UNK who use only UNK applying only the powder technique of x-ray UNK to clay minerals only and who have spent the last fifteen years UNK on the UNK persons in the social sciences in the field of UNK studying the lung capacity of seven UNK indians STOP 
START so we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops as UNK to the UNK who knows less and less about more and more STOP

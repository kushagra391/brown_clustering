START the death of a man is unique and yet it is universal STOP 
START the straight line would UNK its UNK the circle its UNK STOP 
START but how can one figure UNK both declares that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal UNK STOP 
START perhaps no church father saw this UNK of the unique and the universal as clearly or formulated it as precisely as irenaeus STOP 
START to be the UNK and the lord jesus christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own dare not be a cosmic UNK that UNK to earth for a while but never UNK itself with man's history STOP 
START yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind STOP 
START his history is his alone yet each man must recognize his own history in it STOP 
START his death is his alone yet each man can see his own death in the UNK of jesus STOP 
START each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death coming as the head of a new humanity STOP 
START not a circle then nor a straight line but a UNK represents the shape of death as irenaeus sees it a UNK has motion as well as UNK STOP 
START as represented by a UNK history may in some sense be said to repeat itself each historical event remains unique STOP 
START christ is both unique and universal STOP 
START the first turn of the UNK is the UNK history of humanity in adam STOP 
START as UNK UNK the end of history on the basis of its beginning so irenaeus UNK the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ STOP 
START UNK then comes the substance of the first man god's will and wisdom and from virgin earth STOP 
START for god had not UNK says the UNK before man was made and there was no man to till the earth STOP 
START from this earth then while it was still virgin god took dust and UNK the man the beginning of humanity STOP 
START irenaeus does not regard adam and eve merely as private individuals but as universal human beings who were and are all of humanity STOP 
START adam and eve were perfect not in the sense that they possessed perfection but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection STOP 
START they were in fact children STOP 
START irenaeus does not claim UNK for the human soul there is no need for him as there is for UNK to identify existence itself with the fall STOP 
START existence is created and UNK by god and is not the consequence of a UNK rebellion or of a cosmic descent from UNK into history STOP 
START historical existence is a created good STOP 
START the biblical symbol for this UNK is expressed in the words so god created man in his own image the UNK of god he created him STOP 
START there are some passages in the writings of irenaeus where the image of god and the UNK are sharply distinguished so most notably in the statement if the holy spirit is absent from the soul such a man is indeed of an animal nature being left UNK he will be an UNK being UNK the image of god in his formation but not receiving the UNK of god through the spirit STOP 
START thus the image of god is that which makes a man a man and not an UNK UNK of god by contrast is that which makes a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature STOP 
START recent research on irenaeus however makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction STOP 
START he does not mean to say that adam lost the UNK of god and his immortality through the fall he was created not exactly UNK nor yet exactly UNK but capable of immortality as well as of UNK STOP 
START therefore irenaeus describes man's creation as follows so that the man should not have thoughts of UNK and become lifted up as if he had no lord because of the UNK that had been given to him and the freedom fall into sin against god his creator UNK his UNK and take up an attitude of UNK UNK towards god a law was given him by god that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all STOP 
START and he laid down for him certain conditions so that if he kept the command of god then he would always remain as he was that is UNK if he did not he would become UNK melting into earth UNK his frame had been taken STOP 
START these conditions man did not keep and thus he became UNK he did not stop being human as a result STOP 
START there is no justification for UNK the random statements of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this nor for reading into his UNK usage the later theological distinction between the image of god humanity and the UNK of god immortality STOP 
START man was created with the capacity for immortality but the UNK promise of immortality in exchange for UNK cost adam his immortality STOP 
START he was in the words of irenaeus UNK by another under the UNK of immortality STOP 
START the true way to immortality lay through UNK but man did not believe this STOP 
START eve was UNK she did not UNK when as yet she was a virgin STOP 
START and even as she having indeed a husband adam but being nevertheless as yet a virgin having become UNK was made the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race also did mary having a man UNK to her and being nevertheless a virgin by UNK UNK become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race STOP 
START because he UNK the primitive state of man as one of mere UNK or capacity and believes that adam and eve were created as children irenaeus often seems inclined to UNK their UNK as being due no doubt to UNK but still UNK STOP 
START his interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end UNK him to draw these UNK between the virgin eve and the virgin mary STOP 
START that UNK affects his picture of man's UNK too as it was christ the word of god who came to rescue man so it was UNK to the word of god in the beginning that brought death into the world and all our UNK STOP 
START with this act of UNK and not with the UNK of his individual existence man began the downward circuit on the UNK of history UNK from the created capacity for immortality to an UNK UNK STOP 
START at the UNK of that circuit is death STOP 
START along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death because they did eat in UNK UNK to god UNK death STOP 
START UNK as they became UNK to death from that moment they were handed over to it STOP 
START this leads irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that adam and eve died on the same day that they UNK namely on a friday as a parallel to the death of christ on good friday sees a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the UNK STOP 
START in any case though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree they obtained UNK instead STOP 
START the wages of sin is death STOP 
START man's life originally shaped for immortality and for communion with god must now be UNK to the shape of death STOP 
START nevertheless even at the UNK of the circuit the UNK of history belongs to god and he still rules STOP 
START even death therefore has a UNK as well as a UNK function STOP 
START UNK also he god drove him man out of paradise and removed him far from the tree of life not because he UNK him the tree of life as some venture to assert but because he UNK him and did not desire that he should continue a UNK for ever nor that the sin which surrounded him should be UNK and evil UNK and UNK STOP 
START but he set a bound to his state of sin by UNK death and thus causing sin to cease putting an end to it by the UNK of the flesh which should take place in the earth so that man UNK at length to live in sin and dying to it might live to god STOP 
START this idea which occurs in both UNK and UNK fits especially well into the scheme of UNK theology it UNK the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in christ STOP 
START as man can live only by dying so it was only by his dying that christ could bring many to life STOP 
START it is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin is STOP 
START this applies to his picture of adam STOP 
START it is UNK out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next STOP 
START it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam who does indeed come to destroy sin but whose work UNK in the achievement of immortality STOP 
START this emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem irenaeus shares with many early UNK especially the UNK ones STOP 
START they speak of the work of christ as the UNK of UNK which can mean though it does not have to mean UNK from time and history STOP 
START death UNK man of his sin but it UNK him also of his UNK STOP 
START it represents a punishment that he knows he deserves but it also UNK most UNK that he lives his life within the process of time STOP 
START these two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated but they dare not be confused or identified STOP 
START the repeated efforts in christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated STOP 
START such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older in short whether UNK life was intended to be part of the process of time STOP 
START if it was then it must have been god's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to UNK STOP 
START one night so some of these theories run adam would have fallen asleep much as he fell asleep for the creation of eve thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal STOP 
START the UNK of these theories over the UNK of death is an illustration of the UNK that death cannot be only a punishment for some UNK seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change STOP 
START on the other hand christian faith knows that death is more than the natural UNK of UNK existence STOP 
START it is the wages of sin and its UNK is the law STOP 
START if this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural UNK the conclusion seems inevitable that UNK existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the creator STOP 
START this seems to have been the conclusion to which UNK was forced STOP 
START if death receives more than its share of attention from the UNK and if sin receives less than its share the gift of the life eternal through christ begins to look like the UNK appointed means of rescue from UNK i.e. created existence STOP 
START such an interpretation of death radically UNK the christian view of creation it teaches salvation from not salvation in time and history STOP 
START because christianity teaches not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic UNK of the christian understanding of the work of christ STOP

START she lived and was given a name STOP 
START helva STOP 
START for her first three UNK months she waved her UNK UNK kicked UNK with her UNK feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant STOP 
START she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery STOP 
START soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began STOP 
START one of the babies died in the initial UNK but of UNK class seventeen UNK in the metal shells STOP 
START instead of kicking feet UNK UNK responses started her wheels of UNK with hands she UNK mechanical UNK STOP 
START as she UNK more and more UNK UNK would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship STOP 
START for helva was UNK to be the brain half of a UNK ship UNK with a man or a woman UNK she chose as the mobile half STOP 
START she would be among the elite of her kind STOP 
START her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her UNK index was unusually high STOP 
START as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there were no UNK from the pituitary UNK helva would live a UNK rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary normal being STOP 
START however no UNK of her brain patterns no early UNK tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn STOP 
START they would have to UNK their official time and see UNK that the massive doses of UNK would UNK her too as the necessary UNK against her unusual UNK and the pressures of her profession STOP 
START a ship run by a human brain could not run UNK or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their UNK ships STOP 
START brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages STOP 
START most UNK survived the techniques of pituitary UNK that kept their bodies small eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells STOP 
START and very very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine STOP 
START shell people UNK mature UNK in size whatever their UNK UNK were but the UNK brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe STOP 
START so for happy years helva UNK around in her shell with her UNK playing such games as stall UNK studying her lessons in UNK UNK techniques UNK UNK mental UNK basic alien psychology UNK space history law traffic codes all the et UNK that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical informed citizen STOP 
START not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teachers helva UNK the UNK of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her UNK fluid STOP 
START she would one day be grateful to the patient UNK of the UNK instruction STOP 
START UNK civilization was not without busy UNK associations UNK possible UNK to UNK as well as UNK citizens STOP 
START one such group got all UNK over UNK children when helva was just turning fourteen STOP 
START when they were forced to central UNK shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories complete with photographs STOP 
START very few committees ever looked past the first few UNK STOP 
START most of their original objections about shells were UNK by the relief that these hideous to them bodies were UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program STOP 
START she had UNK one of her UNK tools which she would later use for minute UNK to various parts of her control panel STOP 
START her subject was large a copy of the last supper and her canvas small the head of a tiny screw STOP 
START she had UNK her sight to the proper degree STOP 
START as she worked she UNK UNK producing a curious sound STOP 
START shell people used their own vocal UNK and UNK but sound issued through UNK rather than UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK then had a curious UNK a warm UNK quality even in its UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START why what a lovely voice you have said one of the female visitors STOP 
START helva looked up and caught a fascinating UNK of regular dirty UNK on a UNK pink surface STOP 
START her UNK became a UNK of surprise STOP 
START she UNK UNK her sight until the skin lost its UNK look and the UNK assumed normal proportions STOP 
START yes we have quite a few years of voice training UNK remarked helva calmly STOP 
START vocal UNK often become UNK UNK during prolonged UNK distances and must be eliminated STOP 
START i enjoyed my lessons STOP 
START although this was the first time that helva had seen UNK people she took this experience calmly STOP 
START any other reaction would have been reported instantly STOP 
START i meant that you have a nice singing voice dear the lady amended STOP 
START thank you STOP 
START would you like to see my work asked UNK STOP 
START she UNK UNK away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further UNK STOP 
START work the lady STOP 
START i am currently UNK the last supper on the head of a screw STOP 
START no i say the lady UNK STOP 
START helva turned her vision back to UNK and UNK her copy UNK STOP 
START of course some of my color values do not match the old UNK and the perspective is UNK but i believe it to be a fair copy STOP 
START the UNK eyes UNK UNK out STOP 
START oh i forget and UNK voice was really UNK STOP 
START if she could have UNK she would have STOP 
START you people don't have UNK vision STOP 
START the UNK of this UNK grinned with pride and UNK as UNK tone indicated pity for the unfortunate STOP 
START here this will help suggested helva UNK a UNK device in one extension and holding it over the picture STOP 
START in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the UNK UNK and UNK executed last supper on the head of a screw STOP 
START well remarked one gentleman who had been forced to UNK his wife the good lord can eat where angels fear to UNK STOP 
START are you referring sir asked helva UNK to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin i had that in mind STOP 
START if you substitute atom for angel the problem is not insoluble given the UNK content of the pin in question STOP 
START which you are UNK to UNK of course STOP 
START did they remember to program a sense of humor as well young lady we are directed to develop a sense of proportion sir which UNK the same effect STOP 
START the good man UNK UNK and decided the trip was worth his time STOP 
START if the investigation committee spent months UNK the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school they left helva with a UNK as well STOP 
START singing as applicable to herself required research STOP 
START she had of course been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as UNK UNK UNK UNK oklahoma UNK de UNK the atomic age singers eileen UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK as well as the curious rhythmic UNK of the UNK UNK visual UNK and the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP 
START but singing for any shell person UNK considerable technical difficulties to be overcome STOP 
START shell people were UNK to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a UNK STOP 
START balanced properly between optimism and UNK the UNK attitude of the shell people led them to UNK themselves their ships and personnel from UNK situations STOP 
START therefore to helva the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not bother her STOP 
START she would work out a method UNK her limitations whereby she could sing STOP 
START she approached the problem by UNK the methods of sound UNK through the centuries human and instrumental STOP 
START her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal STOP 
START breath control and the proper UNK of UNK sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice STOP 
START shell people did not strictly speaking UNK STOP 
START for their purposes oxygen and other UNK were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained UNK by solution in their shells STOP 
START after experimentation helva discovered that she could UNK her UNK unit to sustain tone STOP 
START by UNK the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the UNK UNK she could direct the UNK sounds into the most UNK position for proper UNK through her throat UNK STOP 
START she compared the results with tape UNK of modern singers and was not UNK although her own UNK had a peculiar quality about them not at all UNK merely unique STOP 
START acquiring a UNK from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall STOP 
START she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy STOP 
START it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK as she pleased STOP 
START it was to helva only a matter of the correct UNK and UNK control required by the music attempted STOP 
START if the authorities remarked on her curious UNK they did so among themselves STOP 
START shell people were encouraged to develop a UNK so long as they maintained UNK in their technical work STOP 
START on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva was UNK graduated and installed in her ship the aj STOP 
START her permanent UNK shell was UNK behind an even more UNK UNK in the central shaft of the UNK ship STOP 
START the UNK UNK visual and UNK connections were made and sealed STOP 
START her UNK were UNK connected or UNK and the final UNK brain UNK were completed while helva remained UNK unaware of the proceedings STOP 
START when she UNK she was the ship STOP 
START her brain and intelligence controlled every function from UNK to such loading as a UNK ship of her class needed STOP 
START she could take care of herself and her UNK half in any situation already recorded in the UNK of central UNK and any situation its most UNK minds could imagine STOP 
START her first actual flight for she and her kind had made UNK flights on UNK panels since she was eight showed her complete UNK of the techniques of her profession STOP 
START she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner STOP 
START there were nine qualified UNK sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was UNK STOP 
START there were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva had been of interest to several department heads in central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section STOP 
START consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners STOP 
START the ship always chose its own partner STOP 
START had there been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have been guided to make the first move STOP 
START as it was while central UNK among itself robert UNK UNK out of the UNK UNK out to the field and over to UNK slim metal hull STOP 
START UNK anyone at home UNK STOP 
START of course replied helva logically UNK her outside UNK STOP 
START are you my partner asked UNK as she recognized the UNK service uniform STOP 
START all you have to do is ask he UNK UNK STOP 
START no one has come STOP 
START i thought perhaps there were no partners available and i've had no UNK from central STOP 
START even to herself helva sounded a little UNK but the truth was she was lonely sitting on the UNK field STOP 
START always she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians by the score STOP 
START the sudden UNK had lost its UNK charm and become UNK STOP 
START no UNK from central is scarcely a cause for UNK but there happen to be eight other guys UNK their UNK to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you you beautiful thing STOP

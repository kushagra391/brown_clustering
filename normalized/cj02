START the cooling requirements are particularly severe at the anode STOP 
START in UNK electric UNK for instance approximately UNK of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat UNK in excess of af as measured by the authors the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere STOP 
START in plasma UNK as currently commercially available for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the cooling medium of the anode STOP 
START the higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the UNK can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in free burning UNK STOP 
START in plasma UNK the UNK forced UNK may UNK the picture somewhat STOP 
START the heat transfer to the anode is due to the following effects 1 STOP

START 2 STOP 
START heat transfer by molecular UNK as well as by radiation from the arc column STOP 
START the heat transfer to the anode in free burning UNK is UNK by a hot gas jet flowing from the UNK towards the anode with UNK up af STOP 
START this phenomenon has been UNK investigated in detail by UNK UNK 1 STOP 
START the pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc rapid decrease of current density from UNK to the anode STOP 
START hence the flow conditions at the anode of free burning UNK UNK those near a UNK point STOP 
START it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of free burning UNK are large compared with those for the UNK STOP 
START the gas flow through a plasma generator will UNK these conditions the anode is still the part receiving the largest heat flux STOP 
START an attempt to improve the life of the UNK or the efficiency of the plasma UNK must therefore aim at a reduction of the anode loss STOP

START the UNK consisted of a 1 diameter UNK UNK rod attached to a water cooled copper tube STOP 
START this tube could be adjusted in its UNK direction by an electric drive to establish the required UNK UNK STOP 
START the anode in figure 2 was mounted by means of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk STOP

START the anode consisted of a 1 inch diameter porous UNK plug 1 inch long STOP 
START the UNK was national carbon UNK 60 which has a UNK of 50% and an average UNK size of 30 STOP 
START this small UNK size was required to UNK uniformity of the flow leaving the anode STOP 
START the anode plug figure 2 was inserted into a carbon anode holder STOP 
START a UNK UNK was used to measure the UNK temperature of the UNK gas STOP 
START it was exposed to a high velocity gas jet STOP 
START a plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided the chamber above the porous plug into two parts STOP 
START this arrangement had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the UNK by natural UNK STOP 
START two UNK shown in figure 1 and 2 UNK instrument co. model UNK served for UNK measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder STOP 
START three UNK were placed at different locations in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature STOP 
START another anode holder used in the experiments is shown in figure 3 STOP 
START in this design the anode holder is water cooled and the heat losses by UNK from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the UNK STOP 
START to reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon UNK was attached to the surface providing an air gap of 1 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder STOP 
START in addition the inner surface of the carbon UNK was covered with aluminum foil to reduce radiation STOP 
START temperatures of the UNK and of the surface of the UNK anode holder were measured by UNK to account for heat received by the UNK but not UNK from the anode plug STOP 
START the UNK flow from commercial bottles was UNK by a pressure UNK and measured with a gas flow UNK STOP

START experimental procedure and error analysis 1 STOP 
START UNK cooled anode with carbon anode holder the anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed with two goals in mind STOP 
START the heat losses of the holder were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be made STOP 
START in order to reduce the number of variable UNK all experiments were made with a constant arc length of UNK and a current of 100 aj STOP 
START the UNK flow through the porous anode was varied UNK between af and af STOP 
START the lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous UNK plug and that it became highly UNK STOP 
START the upper limit was determined by the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature see below since only a small region of the anode was struck by the arc STOP 
START this region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the anode surface changed size and location continuously STOP 
START for each mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured STOP 
START to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug the surface was UNK with a UNK STOP 
START as it turned out a very hot region occurred on the plug STOP 
START its temperature was UNK by af STOP 
START the size of this hot region was estimated by eye STOP 
START the rest of the surface had a temperature which UNK towards the outer diameter of the plug STOP 
START the mean temperature of this region was UNK by the temperature measured UNK between the edge of the hot spot and the UNK of the plug STOP 
START it was UNK by af STOP 
START the mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation af where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot STOP 
START assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the UNK UNK the gas UNK rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation af whereby the specific heat of UNK was taken as af STOP 
START this calculation results in an UNK rise which is somewhat high because it UNK a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures STOP 
START the UNK gas temperature measured with the UNK shown in figure 2 was af STOP 
START the af values are listed in table 1 together with the measured surface temperatures and arc UNK STOP 
START simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements UNK readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 STOP 
START some of these temperatures are UNK in figure 4 STOP 
START they showed no marked dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurements STOP 
START thus the UNK line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for all blowing rates STOP 
START the UNK in the aluminum disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of af STOP 
START this temperature was taken as UNK temperature to which the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned STOP 
START it is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode holder to make the energy flux UNK from the environment toward the anode holder UNK within the accuracy of the present measurements STOP 
START the reflection of radiation UNK from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific UNK STOP 
START the total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts STOP 
START it was calculated from the temperature gradient af at af inch as af STOP 
START the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby af STOP

START how he wondered does one enjoy one's spare time considered some interesting UNK but he was on the road every day from dawn to UNK STOP 
START then there was exercise boating and UNK which was not only good for you but also made you more UNK the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted STOP 
START perhaps golf with a fashionable companion but he'd lost his clubs hadn't played in years STOP 
START there was swimming over at the UNK hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a UNK STOP 
START perhaps a packing trip into the UNK let his beard grow but that was too UNK STOP 
START i could he thought take a long walk but where telephone rang STOP

START how do you do said UNK STOP 
START our church is UNK a group of very UNK women up in alaska STOP

START UNK owen thought UNK and UNK STOP 
START there was a slight nervous UNK in the region of her left eye STOP 
START it gave her a UNK UNK effect STOP 
START have you ever tried to reason with an UNK asked UNK wildly STOP 
START they are a very difficult group of people STOP 
START i don't know much about them owen admitted but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably UNK UNK coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do STOP 
START she smiled in a UNK fashion STOP 
START you know that's very interesting STOP 
START people don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that STOP 
START the more UNK i do the more i note how far most people are from their personal god STOP 
START UNK owen kept his peace STOP 
START what would happen next she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the pitch people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly UNK trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice STOP 
START how did you get by the desk asked curiously STOP 
START i'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're UNK around the UNK UNK on UNK doors and talking down UNK STOP 
START oh i just come once a week STOP 
START every day i visit a different hotel STOP 
START i feel it's my duty STOP 
START i do this work all on my own because i understand the difficulties and i want to help these UNK STOP

START do you have any idea how far i travel every day have the whole pacific northwest STOP 
START owen was aware he was getting UNK but he couldn't help himself STOP 
START mrs. UNK parker drew back STOP 
START that's hardly a christian approach she UNK STOP 
START you're in the secular world STOP 
START i didn't say it was christian STOP 
START i don't think you'll find many active christian salesmen STOP 
START not that religion isn't big business UNK and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses but they don't get top personnel STOP

START i have no card she said bitterly STOP 
START you haven't been listening to what i've been telling you STOP 
START i only hope my talking to you has helped you a little anyway because you need spiritual UNK STOP 
START she looked UNK as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race STOP 
START she stood UNK for a moment then walked down the hall heard her UNK on another door STOP 
START it took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself he realized he was hungry STOP 
START he UNK UNK dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast STOP 
START on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail STOP 
START there was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic UNK on new lines they always issued STOP 
START his lawyer had sent him a statement on his UNK UNK and there was a letter from the UNK of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's UNK STOP 
START he ate breakfast in a UNK mood but afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt UNK STOP 
START he looked off to the crest of the UNK still UNK UNK of the UNK river made a wide UNK STOP 
START he felt suddenly UNK UNK STOP 
START with any luck at all he could easily find a UNK STOP 
START although it was only three o'clock he stopped in at the golden calf STOP 
START the tables were all spinning the dice UNK the bar crowded STOP 
START just to test himself he played UNK for quarters on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he had won surprisingly twenty dollars STOP 
START the way was opening up the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its UNK around in his stomach STOP 
START the golden calf was dimly lit with UNK neon STOP 
START there were more women than men in the place but he couldn't find a UNK STOP 
START they all had the hard look of UNK who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly UNK what showed up STOP 
START the UNK around the wall UNK early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more UNK than the UNK STOP 
START the women had a bright shining UNK as they leaned out from the wall and UNK UNK into the distance while the men were stern but hopeful STOP 
START all of course except the UNK party who were bent on UNK to death STOP 
START i wonder if they did eat each other at the end owen UNK STOP 
START he sat down next to a UNK blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes STOP 
START she sighed a dirty word and left STOP 
START owen was surprised to see mrs. UNK parker playing the UNK UNK that were UNK arranged by the entrance STOP 
START she sat down and played two UNK at once looking grim as if UNK by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the UNK depending on her support STOP 
START a UNK cowboy sat down next to him in the UNK place STOP 
START he was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the UNK STOP 
START what you need is a steady UNK the cowboy announced after watching owen play STOP 
START you can't build on your UNK UNK STOP 
START what are you playing asked STOP 
START i'm just UNK the cowboy explained STOP

START he's a UNK and he photographs wonderfully STOP 
START five came up while owen was listening to the UNK and he neglected to play a loss of ten dollars STOP 
START this proved UNK that the UNK was a UNK so he walked on down to UNK an even more UNK gambling UNK than the golden calf STOP 
START when he looked in the back mrs. UNK parker was marking UNK cards STOP 
START his UNK spirit had UNK studied the pistol exhibition that UNK UNK as an added attraction STOP 
START he UNK a long UNK with green eyes but she was a UNK with her money in front of her STOP 
START he had no great prejudice against UNK just seemed such a dry run STOP 
START there was no cash around was UNK silver dollars STOP 
START the management UNK UNK the green stuff into the office and gave the customers UNK or checks or premium points STOP 
START he read a special announcement whereby UNK would feature a special UNK at three a.m. UNK UNK the body UNK and fourteen UNK UNK STOP 
START he wondered if he might bag a tourist but they looked frightened of him STOP 
START he passed two UNK both wearing UNK and they made him feel a little sad STOP 
START owen found buzz watching UNK STOP 
START buzz had on a UNK shirt and was carrying some UNK oil and dark glasses STOP 
START he was shorter and UNK than owen who felt good standing next to him STOP 
START we're all going over to lake UNK and try our luck at UNK buzz explained still UNK STOP

START his eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky they'd UNK at my noise growing red and raising up his rage STOP 
START i decided i hated the UNK kid too dying in our kitchen while i was away where i couldn't watch dying just to entertain hans and making me go up UNK steps and down a UNK hall pa UNK under the covers at the end like UNK covered with snow UNK and UNK STOP 
START oh he'd not care about the UNK kid STOP 
START he'd not care about getting UNK so he could give up some of his whisky to a UNK of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the UNK STOP 
START that would make him mad enough if he was sober STOP 
START i didn't hurry though it was cold and the UNK kid was in the kitchen STOP 
START he was all UNK up like i thought he'd be STOP 
START i pushed at his shoulder calling his name STOP 
START i think his name stopped the UNK but he didn't move except to roll a little when i UNK him STOP 
START the covers slid down his UNK neck so i saw his head UNK like a UNK gone to seed but his face was turned to the wall there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster and i thought well you don't look much like a UNK UNK now STOP 
START i couldn't be sure he was still asleep STOP 
START he was a UNK UNK STOP 
START i shook him a little harder and made some noise STOP 
START UNK i said STOP 
START i was leaning too far over STOP 
START i knew better STOP 
START he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him STOP 
START oh he was smart STOP 
START it put you off STOP 
START i knew better but i was thinking of the UNK kid UNK in all that dough STOP 
START when his arm came up i UNK away but it caught me on the side of the neck UNK my eyes and i backed off to UNK STOP 
START pa was on his side looking at me his eyes UNK the hand that had hit me a fist in the UNK STOP 
START get the hell out of here STOP 
START i didn't say anything trying to get my throat clear but i watched him STOP 
START he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear STOP 
START it was better though he'd hit me STOP 
START he was bitter when he missed STOP

START he was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the UNK STOP 
START he had long black hairs on his UNK STOP 
START they curled around the UNK of his UNK STOP 
START big hans made me come STOP 
START big hans said a fat hell on big hans STOP 
START he's an even bigger fool than you are STOP 
START fat hey taught him UNK and i'll teach you STOP

START UNK been UNK in that pot STOP 
START hans got an UNK STOP 
START he didn't even bother to UNK himself off and he UNK part of UNK door down before he stopped STOP 
START he might not have gone that far if pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house STOP 
START that pot put pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it STOP 
START i always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their UNK like a laugh or a UNK as eager as an animal to be out STOP 
START i heard pa UNK all the way downstairs STOP 
START hans had laid UNK towels over the kid's chest and stomach STOP 
START he was rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet STOP 
START water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough was turning UNK UNK to the kid's back and behind STOP 
START ain't he going to wake up what about your pa he was awake when i left STOP 
START UNK he say you get the whisky he said a fat hell on big hans STOP

START you want the kid to die you get your pa and get that whisky STOP 
START pa don't care about the kid STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START well he don't STOP 
START he don't care at all and i don't care to get my head UNK neither STOP 
START he don't care and i don't care to have his UNK flung on me STOP 
START he don't care about anybody STOP 
START all he UNK about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face STOP 
START get UNK that's what he wants STOP 
START he don't care about nothing else at all STOP 
START nothing STOP 
START not UNK kid neither STOP 
START that UNK STOP 
START not the kid neither STOP 
START i'll get the spirits ma said STOP 
START i'd wound big hans up tight STOP 
START i was ready to jump but when ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down STOP 
START ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off STOP 
START not any more STOP 
START not for years STOP 
START the first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the UNK on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot UNK and maybe she saw him UNK it again the dirty UNK UNK out as it flew STOP 
START it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for big hans to remember going after the UNK while he was still UNK with UNK yellow sick UNK STOP 
START no you won't big hans said STOP 
START yes hans if they're needed ma said STOP 
START hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her STOP 
START if we had then one of us would have had to go instead STOP 
START hans rubbed the kid with more snow rubbed rubbed STOP 
START i'll get more snow i said STOP 
START i took the UNK and UNK and went out on the porch STOP 
START i don't know where ma went STOP 
START i thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had STOP 
START she had surprised hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have because when i came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and hans was holding it UNK by the throat STOP 
START oh he was being UNK and careful UNK about in the UNK and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm STOP 
START he was awful angry because he'd thought ma was going to do something big something heroic even especially for her i know him i know him we felt the same sometimes while ma wasn't thinking about that at all not anything like that STOP 
START there was no way of getting even STOP 
START it wasn't like getting UNK at the fair STOP 
START they were always trying so you got to expect it STOP 
START now hans had given ma something of his we both had when we thought she was going straight to pa something valuable since she didn't know we'd given it to her there was no easy way of getting it back STOP 
START hans cut the foil off finally and UNK the cap STOP 
START he was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done STOP 
START ma had found one of UNK hiding places STOP 
START she'd found one and she hadn't said a word while big hans and i had UNK and UNK as we always did all winter every winter since the spring that hans had come and i had looked in the UNK and found the first one STOP 
START pa had a UNK for hiding STOP 
START he knew we were looking and he enjoyed it STOP 
START but now ma STOP 
START she'd found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago UNK been or how many other ones she'd found saying nothing STOP 
START pa was sure to find out STOP 
START sometimes he didn't seem to because he UNK them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't UNK one after all or had drunk it up STOP 
START but he'd find out about this one because we were using it STOP 
START a fool could see what was going on STOP 
START if he found out ma found it UNK be bad STOP 
START he took pride in his hiding STOP 
START it was all the pride he had STOP 
START i guess UNK hans and me took doing STOP 
START but he didn't figure ma for much STOP 
START he didn't figure her at all and if he found out a woman UNK be bad STOP 
START hans poured some in a UNK STOP 
START you going to put more towels on him no STOP 
START why not what he needs something warm to his skin don't he not where he's UNK good STOP 
START UNK bad for UNK STOP 
START that's why i only put towels on his chest and belly STOP 
START he's got to UNK slow STOP 
START you ought to know that STOP 
START colors on the towels had run STOP 
START ma UNK her UNK in the kid's clothes STOP 
START what are we going to do with these hans began UNK whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was UNK from his chin STOP 
START here help me UNK him up STOP 
START i got hold his mouth open STOP 
START i didn't want to touch him and i hoped ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to STOP 
START come on UNK STOP 
START all right STOP 
START lift don't UNK lift STOP 
START UNK i'm UNK STOP

START draw a line across the country at the UNK of lower pennsylvania STOP 
START any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be UNK in 10 years STOP 
START fortunately it is the UNK which has arrived at this conclusion for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress STOP 
START even if you live above that line the UNK will back you for they have decided that the UNK of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged STOP 
START new UNK UNK units recently devised UNK UNK UNK and improved UNK techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an UNK house for as little as $600 to UNK STOP 
START two men can often do the installation in a day STOP 
START you can UNK it yourself this is a central system that will cool every part of your house STOP 
START its UNK less an authority than the UNK UNK that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than UNK its operating costs STOP 
START is it UNK air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of UNK theaters and the thermal shock they UNK STOP 
START we know now that a UNK differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable and accurate controls assure the comfort we want STOP 
START we know too that health is never UNK by summer cooling STOP 
START on the contrary there are fewer UNK and smaller doctor bills STOP 
START the UNK air benefits UNK UNK UNK hay fever STOP 
START control of temperature and UNK is a UNK to the aged and the UNK STOP 
START heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by UNK heat STOP 
START UNK is easier STOP 
START the UNK air means less time spent pushing a vacuum fewer trips to the dry UNK lighter UNK for the washing machine STOP 
START the need for UNK UNK UNK becomes more UNK STOP 
START clothes hold their shape better and UNK and UNK become almost forgotten words STOP 
START it will improve your disposition STOP 
START when you're less UNK things just naturally look UNK STOP 
START the children can have their daytime UNK and hot meals and be put to bed on schedule in UNK rooms STOP 
START you'll sleep longer and better too awake UNK and free of hot weather nerves STOP 
START you can forget about UNK and leave the storm windows up all year around STOP 
START best of all central air conditioning is something you can afford STOP 
START like its UNK cousin the refrigerator a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more STOP 
START that brings its UNK cost down mighty low STOP 
START for any house STOP 
START UNK matter what style your home is ranch UNK colonial or contemporary central air conditioning is easily installed STOP 
START the equipment won't take up valuable space either STOP 
START it can go in UNK waste space STOP 
START but there's no UNK that the UNK and most economical way to get UNK UNK air conditioning is when you build STOP 
START if that's done the house can be designed and oriented for best operation and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself STOP 
START if you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building by all means make provision for its easy adding later STOP 
START manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances and your savings over starting from UNK will be substantial STOP 
START if your house is to have a forced warm air system cooling can be a part of it STOP 
START this costs less than having a completely separate cooling system for your regular heating UNK UNK and furnace UNK do double duty for cooling STOP 
START you can get UNK air UNK in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone high or low boy UNK or UNK STOP 
START the units can be installed in basement attic UNK or in a closet located in the living area STOP 
START the cooling UNK is located in the UNK UNK STOP 
START from the UNK small copper UNK UNK to a UNK refrigeration section set in the yard garage UNK or basement STOP 
START if you plan to add cooling later to your heating system there are things to watch for STOP 
START be sure UNK that require UNK get it when they are installed STOP 
START they may be UNK later STOP 
START be sure your UNK and UNK are big enough to handle cooling STOP 
START this is especially important if you live in a UNK zone STOP 
START be sure you get a UNK heating system and UNK that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating STOP 
START you can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house STOP 
START for cooling UNK water is UNK instead of hot water STOP 
START instead of UNK you'll have UNK units each with its own UNK STOP 
START these systems are more expensive than UNK forced air systems STOP 
START the minimum cost for an average UNK UNK house with basement is likely to run UNK above the cost of the heating alone STOP 
START separate systems STOP 
START -hlif the problems of UNK cooling with your heating are UNK it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system STOP 
START the UNK kind of separate system uses a single UNK unit STOP 
START it is in effect an UNK room conditioner equipped with UNK UNK UNK to UNK the cooled cleaned UNK air where it is wanted STOP 
START in a long UNK ranch two such units can be installed one serving the living area the other the sleeping zone STOP 
START in a UNK house one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor another in the attic to cool the second STOP 
START in each case having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of UNK individual zone control STOP 
START the heat pump STOP 
START UNK of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating STOP 
START as you know a conditioner makes UNK air cool by UNK the heat out of it and then UNK this heat UNK STOP 
START a relatively simple UNK arrangement UNK the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward and the heat is UNK from outdoor air and turned UNK STOP 
START up until recently this heat pump method of UNK air was efficient only in areas of mild UNK and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees STOP 
START now the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees STOP 
START you can get this added heating feature for as little as UNK more than the price of cooling alone STOP 
START consider it as a UNK UNK at UNK cost for those UNK when the furnace UNK a UNK holds up fuel delivery or for cool summer UNK or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant STOP 
START what size conditioner large a cooling unit you need and the method of its installation depends on a variety of factors STOP 
START among other things besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside it will depend upon your personal habits and the UNK of your family STOP 
START families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool STOP 
START if you are a party UNK you may need added capacity STOP 
START the body is a heat machine and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load STOP 
START cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of aj STOP 
START a UNK is a unit of heat and the UNK UNK of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour STOP 
START a very rough rule of UNK is that under favorable conditions you'll need 15 UNK of cooling for every square foot of your house STOP 
START this is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of UNK degrees STOP 
START you'll need more if the high average is above that less if it's below STOP 
START UNK are also UNK by tons STOP 
START a ton of cooling UNK to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice STOP 
START by accepted definition a UNK conditioner will provide UNK UNK of cooling in one hour STOP 
START you may find a conditioner UNK by UNK STOP 
START it is generally an UNK method of UNK for the UNK is that of the UNK motor and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get STOP 
START a UNK conditioner for example may vary in effectiveness from under UNK UNK to well over 10,000 aj STOP 
START the UNK procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need rather than trying to do this yourself STOP 
START don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough STOP 
START better to have your equipment slightly UNK than too big STOP 
START here's why reducing UNK is often as important as cooling STOP 
START an UNK unit will cool off your house quickly then shut down for a long period STOP 
START before it UNK on again UNK can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low STOP 
START with a unit of the right size a UNK will run continuously during hot weather reducing UNK as UNK as it does temperature STOP 
START UNK tips STOP 
START UNK to details can cut in half the size unit you need and UNK operating expense UNK STOP 
START a UNK UNK house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as UNK a year or UNK a month STOP 
START if you have a house which heat doesn't UNK easily your unit will have less heat to remove STOP 
START keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle STOP 
START in a new house generous roof UNK are a logical and effective solution STOP 
START if the house you plan to buy or build won't have big UNK you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed UNK fences and UNK STOP 
START shade trees too are a big help so keep them if you can STOP 
START drawn UNK and UNK do some good but not nearly as much as UNK devices on the outside of the house STOP 
START the more directly the sun strikes walls and roof the greater its heat impact STOP 
START the way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need STOP 
START a shift in the walls or a change in the roof slope so the sun hits them more UNK can save you money STOP 
START you can use UNK glass to stop the sun double glass and UNK glass to combat UNK STOP 
START restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house STOP 
START they're easier to shade there STOP 
START an attic space above UNK makes a house easier to cool STOP 
START you'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space and using an electric range instead of a gas one STOP 
START gas UNK to the UNK load STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK to the maximum STOP 
START in UNK the numbers to remember are UNK STOP 
START they stand for 6 inches of mineral UNK UNK in the ceiling 4 inches in the side walls 2 inches in the floors STOP 
START such UNK UNK not only permits a much smaller cooling installation but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling STOP 
START a UNK roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent STOP 
START it costs two to three times as much to remove a UNK in summer as it does to add one in winter so every solitary UNK is worth attention STOP 
START you'll foil them in UNK along with their UNK UNK by having and using a kitchen range UNK fan a bathroom UNK for when you shower and an outside UNK for the clothes UNK STOP 
START keeping UNK quiet STOP 
START UNK no use pretending that all UNK are quiet but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum STOP 
START good UNK is important in the installation so if you're doing your own UNK don't award the job on the basis of price alone STOP 
START avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom STOP

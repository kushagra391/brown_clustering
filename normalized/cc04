START the UNK UNK presents king of hearts by jean UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START directed by michael UNK by william david roberts STOP 
START the cast producer john holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his UNK UNK at UNK in jean UNK king of hearts STOP 
START the dialogue is sharp UNK and UNK typical don't eat the UNK material which has UNK the author throughout her books and plays and it was obvious that the UNK audience liked it STOP 
START the story is of a famous strip UNK an UNK individual whose UNK is the american boy and who UNK a UNK to provide him with fresh idea material STOP 
START this is when his troubles begin not to mention a UNK artist who he UNK and who turns out to have ideas of his own with particular respect to the UNK UNK STOP 
START john UNK playing UNK UNK the UNK carries the show in marvelous fashion STOP 
START his UNK of an UNK UNK artist is virtually UNK STOP 
START this may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint of david UNK UNK contribution to hollywood who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th UNK STOP 
START not that mr. UNK does not make the most of his role STOP 
START he does and more STOP 
START but the book is written around a somewhat UNK UNK and it has to be that way STOP 
START a word should be said for UNK morgan a broadway UNK who as the adopted son makes life miserable for nearly everybody and UNK in particular STOP 
START and for his UNK francis UNK of west warwick who has a bit part billy STOP 
START on the whole audiences will like this performance STOP 
START it is a tremendous book lively constantly moving and the UNK cast does well by it STOP 
START the newport UNK presents UNK for george dillon by john UNK and anthony UNK directed by UNK gray STOP 
START the cast the UNK young man in newport last night was at the UNK where UNK for george dillon opened as the jazz festival closed STOP 
START for the hero of this work by john UNK and anthony UNK is a UNK UNK by more than the lack of beer during a UNK session STOP 
START he's mad at a world he did not make STOP 
START furthermore he's something of a UNK an artist whose mind and feelings are all UNK STOP 
START this is in contrast to the family with whom he boards STOP 
START they not only think and feel UNK but live UNK as well STOP 
START it is into this household one UNK by UNK that have UNK the souls out of its people that george dillon enters at the beginning of the play STOP 
START an UNK UNK and actor he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists STOP 
START by the end of the third act the artist is dead but the body UNK on a shell among other shells STOP 
START not altogether a successful play UNK for george dillon UNK through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be UNK STOP 
START it is UNK UNK for instance and not all of the talk is terribly impressive STOP 
START but it strikes UNK on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten STOP 
START there is a fine second act as an example one in which samuel UNK as dillon has an opportunity to UNK away in one UNK passage after another STOP 
START this is an exciting young actor to watch STOP 
START just as exciting but in a more UNK UNK way is laura stuart whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch STOP 
START miss stuart is as UNK UNK as one could wish almost an icy UNK threatening to UNK at any moment STOP 
START also fine are sue UNK as a mother more protective and UNK than a female UNK and just as destructive harold UNK as her UNK UNK and UNK UNK as a UNK in human form STOP 
START UNK gray has directed a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste STOP 
START still his UNK is put together with taste and a most sensitive UNK of that pale UNK despair STOP 
START the warwick musical theater presents UNK UNK with music and lyrics by frank UNK directed by UNK UNK UNK by peter UNK musical direction by samuel UNK STOP 
START the cast everybody fell in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater and shelley UNK was to blame STOP 
START one of the finest soft shoe UNK ever invented once in love with amy is also of course one of the most UNK persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era STOP 
START so the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after act 2 got a UNK opening chorus UNK UNK and UNK UNK out all alone on the stage with the UNK UNK and beat of the song just UNK into being STOP 
START it is greatly to UNK credit that he made no attempt to UNK ray UNK STOP 
START he dropped his earlier and delightful UNK which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called UNK aunt and let himself go with as appealing an amy as anybody could ask STOP 
START in brief UNK played himself and not UNK STOP 
START the big audience started UNK even before he had finished STOP 
START the whole production this week is fresh and lively STOP 
START the costumes are UNK UNK of the UNK UNK and picture hats of the UNK girl days STOP 
START the ballet work is on the nose especially in the opening number by the new UNK marching society and UNK UNK band along with a UNK and UNK UNK UNK later STOP 
START UNK whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club UNK proved himself very much at home in musical comedy STOP 
START UNK virginia UNK with UNK blue eyes and a UNK smile made a UNK UNK amy while UNK UNK as the real aunt was UNK UNK in the very best UNK girl manner STOP 
START all told UNK UNK ought not to be missed STOP 
START it has a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good UNK but an appealing person in his own right mr. UNK STOP 
START the broadway theater league of rhode island presents c. edwin UNK and martin UNK production of UNK at veterans memorial auditorium STOP 
START the book is by UNK UNK and george UNK music by jerry UNK lyrics by UNK UNK UNK by peter UNK scenery costumes and lighting by william and jean UNK musical direction by jack UNK and the production was directed by mr. UNK STOP 
START the cast this is one of the happier events of the season STOP 
START the company which performed the UNK prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of UNK the politicians are in fine voice the UNK UNK happy memories and the little flower UNK to break a UNK again STOP 
START i saw UNK performed in new york by the original cast and i think this company is every bit as good and perhaps better STOP 
START certainly in the matter of UNK there is nothing lacking STOP 
START bob carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to UNK as tom UNK does but i was amazed at the way he became more and more UNK as the evening progressed until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this wasn't really UNK come back among us again STOP 
START then UNK bond was simply grand as ben the UNK republican party district UNK STOP 
START and paul UNK as morris the faithful one who never gets home to his UNK dinner was fine too STOP 
START as for the ladies they were full of charm and sincerity and deep and UNK affection for this UNK driving honest little man STOP 
START charlotte UNK was excellent as the loyal UNK who became the second mrs. UNK singing and acting with remarkable conviction STOP 
START UNK nelson as UNK his first wife managed to make that short role impressive STOP 
START and little UNK north a UNK with real spirit and UNK was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for UNK the cop who becomes UNK commissioner and then is promoted into UNK or just dancing to display her UNK feelings STOP 
START such fascinating UNK in the score as the UNK treatment of on the side of the angels and politics and UNK were handled UNK and i thought UNK bond and his band of UNK UNK made little tin box even better than it was done by the new york cast the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity STOP 
START the party at UNK UNK gave the UNK a chance for a UNK UNK through all those UNK UNK which have become a classic UNK statement of the UNK nonsense STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK when he is running for congress are well staged and wind up in a wild jewish UNK that is really great musical theater STOP 
START martin UNK has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START not a corner has been UNK cut in this one STOP 
START the sets are remarkably elaborate for a UNK that doesn't pause long in any one place and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of UNK or UNK STOP 
START several times recently i have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes STOP 
START i'm glad to say there's none of that UNK in this UNK it has all been done in superb style and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person UNK who UNK good musical theater STOP 
START UNK theater presents where the boys are an UNK picture produced by joe UNK and directed by henry UNK from a UNK by george wells STOP 
START the cast since the hero a UNK and upright fellow is a rich brown senior while two UNK are cast as UNK UNK i suppose i should UNK myself from sitting in judgment on where the boys are but i shall do nothing of the sort STOP 
START instead and not just to prove my UNK i UNK to report that it's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the easter vacation UNK of UNK down in fort UNK and that it seems to come to UNK quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly UNK youngsters in this age group that is to say sex STOP 
START the answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and UNK individual STOP 
START if most of them weren't exactly specific well that's the way it is in life i guess STOP 
START but at least it's UNK to see some UNK who don't UNK to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead STOP 
START where the boys are also has a juvenile UNK that makes for a UNK venture in comedy STOP 
START there are some sharp and UNK lines and some UNK funny situations the best of the latter being a mass UNK UNK into a UNK tank where a UNK is performing STOP 
START most of the female faces are new or at least not too familiar STOP 
START dolores hart is charming in a leading role and quite UNK STOP 
START i was delighted with paula UNK comedy performance which was as fresh and UNK as one's highest hopes might ask STOP 
START a couple of the males made good comedy too jim UNK and frank UNK STOP 
START the only performance which was too soft for me was that of UNK UNK but since someone had to become the victim of UNK just to emphasize that such things do happen at these UNK i suppose this was the attitude the part called for STOP 
START i must say however that i preferred the acting that had something of a UNK edge to it STOP 
START to anyone who remembers newport at its less than maximum violence this view of what the boys and girls do in the UNK before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertaining STOP 
START the second feature the price of silence is a british detective story that will talk your head off STOP

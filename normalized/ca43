START UNK of UNK bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the UNK STOP 
START long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward STOP 
START higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues STOP 
START result is a better prospect for a full UNK by bonds that once were regarded as highly UNK STOP 
START things are looking up these days for many of the state UNK on which investors depend for income from their UNK bonds STOP 
START traffic on nearly all the UNK has been growing STOP 
START that added traffic means rising streams of UNK and quarters at toll gates STOP 
START as a result of the new outlook for UNK investors who bought UNK bonds when these UNK UNK as UNK UNK are now finding new hope for their UNK STOP 
START another result is that UNK are UNK to bid up the prices of these UNK bonds STOP 
START other UNK bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 according to standard UNK average STOP 
START on balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then STOP 
START however in the same UNK period UNK bonds as a group have UNK this trend STOP 
START on these bonds price rises since february 21 easily UNK price UNK STOP 
START UNK returns STOP 
START UNK however still see an element of UNK risk in the UNK bonds STOP 
START you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page STOP 
START many of the UNK bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that STOP 
START and this is true in the case of some UNK on which revenues have UNK close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds STOP 
START that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds STOP 
START it's not much more in fact than the return that is offered on u. s. treasury bonds STOP 
START for investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a UNK yield of 4 per cent is high STOP 
START it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an UNK UNK with more than UNK of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than UNK of taxed income STOP 
START swelling traffic STOP 
START -hla new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent UNK period ending in february or march shows what is happening STOP 
START the report is based on a survey by UNK company investment bankers STOP 
START nearly all the UNK show gains in net revenues during the period STOP 
START and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic UNK late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business UNK STOP 
START many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter STOP 
START indication the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward STOP 
START look for example at the ohio turnpike STOP 
START traffic on that road UNK sharply in january and february as compared with those same months in 1960 STOP 
START then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs STOP 
START as a result the UNK net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were UNK per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds STOP 
START that was up from UNK per cent in the preceding 12 months STOP 
START that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike STOP 
START operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in march STOP 
START costs were held down despite a bitter winter STOP 
START for the year the road earned UNK per cent of its interest costs against UNK per cent in the preceding period STOP 
START the UNK engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston STOP 
START slow successes STOP 
START UNK UNK have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do STOP 
START the UNK illinois state toll highway for example was not opened over its entire length until december 1958 STOP 
START in the 12 months ended in february 1960 the highway earned enough to cover UNK per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial UNK STOP 
START in the 12 months ended in february 1961 this highway earned UNK per cent of its interest STOP 
START that improvement is continuing STOP 
START in the first two months of 1961 earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up UNK per cent from early 1960 STOP 
START success for many UNK has come hard STOP 
START traffic frequently has failed to measure up to UNK UNK estimates STOP 
START in these cases the turnpike UNK have had to turn to UNK increases or to costly improvements such as UNK or better connections with other highways STOP 
START many rate increases already have been put into effect STOP 
START higher UNK are planned for july 1 1961 on the UNK UNK turnpike and proposals for increased UNK on the texas turnpike are under study STOP 
START easier access STOP 
START UNK is being made too in improving UNK access to many UNK STOP 
START the kansas turnpike offers an illustration STOP 
START net earnings of that road rose from UNK per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to UNK per cent in the 12 months ended feb. 28 1961 STOP 
START further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new UNK at UNK and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city UNK and kansas city UNK STOP 
START meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the UNK reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years STOP 
START for some roads troubles STOP 
START UNK studying the UNK bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals STOP 
START traffic and revenues on the chicago UNK have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike STOP 
START if nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in UNK of interest in 1962 STOP 
START west virginia toll bonds have UNK in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues UNK of the bonds are faced with more of the same STOP 
START these however are exceptions STOP 
START the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement STOP 
START it's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the UNK bonds will pay out in full STOP 
START already however several of the UNK are UNK enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable UNK STOP 
START many others are UNK the traffic needed to push revenues up to the UNK point STOP 
START a top american official after a look at UNK factories thinks the u.s. is in a very serious situation UNK STOP 
START commerce secretary UNK hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on may 10 UNK plants of two of UNK biggest companies fiat the auto producer and UNK maker of UNK and UNK machines STOP 
START our staff man UNK from UNK as follows follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this one modern equipment much of it supplied under the marshall plan UNK fiat to turn out UNK cars a day STOP 
START about half of these are UNK STOP 
START two wage costs are a fraction of the u.s. costs STOP 
START a skilled worker on the assembly line for example UNK UNK a week STOP 
START three labor troubles are UNK STOP 
START fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years STOP 
START said secretary hodges it's a tough combination for the u.s. to face STOP 
START UNK had a special interest for hodges STOP 
START UNK took over UNK the u.s. UNK maker in late 1959 STOP 
START within a year without reducing wages UNK production costs were cut one third prices were UNK STOP 
START the result has been that exports of UNK products have doubled STOP 
START the UNK plant near UNK has modern UNK modern machinery STOP 
START the firm is UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the u.s. STOP 
START the UNK of foreign capital would help the u.s. balance of payments STOP 
START hodges predicted i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the u.s. STOP 
START there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas STOP 
START foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is UNK new ways of handling competitive imports STOP 
START the recently UNK kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines STOP 
START important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these an international conference of the big UNK and UNK countries will be called shortly by president kennedy STOP 
START chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting STOP 
START the u.s. will try to get agreement among the UNK countries to take more textile imports from the UNK countries over the years STOP 
START point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet STOP 
START if they have trouble UNK international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would STOP 
START idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible STOP 
START at the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain UNK countries to control textile exports especially UNK of specific products to UNK UNK countries STOP 
START japan since 1957 has been UNK UNK exports of textiles to the u.s. STOP 
START hong kong india and UNK have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the UNK UNK STOP 
START none of these countries is happy with these arrangements STOP 
START the japanese want to increase exports to the u.s. while they have been UNK shipments they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big u.s. market STOP 
START hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain while spanish and UNK textiles UNK into british market UNK STOP 
START the indians and UNK are UNK under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons STOP 
START the kennedy hope is that at the conference or through UNK talks the UNK UNK countries in asia and europe will see that UNK practices cause friction all around and may result in import UNK STOP 
START gradual controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what president kennedy wants STOP 
START this may point the way toward international UNK agreements in other products STOP 
START it's an important clue to washington thinking STOP 
START note too that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or UNK of the u.s. textile industry STOP 
START get competitive or get out STOP 
START in UNK terms that's what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry STOP 
START the government will help in UNK companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesn't seem feasible STOP 
START special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed STOP 
START government research will look into new products and methods STOP 
START import UNK aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved STOP 
START but the kennedy administration doesn't favor import UNK STOP 
START rather they are impressed with the british government's success in forcing and helping the british textile industry to UNK and to change over to other products STOP 
START what's happening in textiles can be UNK on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from UNK countries STOP 
START among the UNK workers in the world are u.s. coal UNK STOP 
START yet u.s. coal is cheap enough to make foreign UNK UNK water STOP 
START steel company of UNK a british UNK wants to bring in virginia coal cut down on its UNK of UNK coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets STOP 
START virginia coal delivered by ship in UNK will be about UNK a ton cheaper than UNK coal delivered by rail from nearby mines STOP 
START u.s. coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread UNK of mines wide coal UNK UNK rates on ocean freight STOP 
START many of the coal UNK in the UNK british mines are twisting narrow and very deep STOP 
START productivity of u.s. UNK is twice that of the british STOP 
START UNK coal UNK UNK are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal STOP 
START they threaten to strike STOP 
START the british government will have to decide whether to let u.s. coal in STOP 
START the british coal industry is UNK has large coal stocks it can't sell STOP

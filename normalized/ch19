START while there should be no general age limit or UNK to one sex there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women STOP 
START the peace corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family unless the wife is also accepted for full-time peace corps work on the same project STOP 
START there should be no draft UNK because of peace corps service STOP 
START in most cases service in the corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary UNK STOP 
START peace corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the united states STOP 
START nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid STOP 
START the UNK principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services STOP 
START rather the principle should be UNK to that of the allowance STOP 
START peace corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living STOP 
START they should live in modest circumstances avoiding all UNK consumption STOP 
START wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts STOP 
START some special health requirements might have to be met STOP 
START for example it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers STOP 
START perhaps existing public health service state department and armed services medical facilities can be UNK STOP 
START for UNK to the u.s. volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service based on the length of time served STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START -hlin what part of the government should the peace corps be established idea of a peace corps has captured the imagination of a great many people STOP 
START support for it cuts across party regional ethnic and other lines STOP 
START the peace corps therefore offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world an opportunity for the american people to think UNK and start UNK in their participation in world development STOP 
START for this the peace corps should be administered by a small new alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation STOP 
START pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program the peace corps should be established as an agency in the department of state STOP 
START when the aid operations are UNK the peace corps should remain a UNK functional unit STOP 
START meanwhile the peace corps could be physically located in UNK facilities and depend on the state department and UNK for administrative support and when needed program assistance STOP 
START in this way the peace corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for united states foreign policy and our overseas operations STOP 
START 8 STOP 
START UNK and when should the peace corps be launched peace corps can either begin in very low gear with only UNK work undertaken between now and when congress finally UNK special funds for it or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action with sufficient funds and made available from existing mutual security UNK to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer STOP 
START the peace corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to UNK the most qualified people from this year's UNK classes will not be lost STOP 
START nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university UNK STOP 
START if launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks the peace corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall STOP 
START within a year or two several thousand might be in service STOP 
START it can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated STOP 
START 9 STOP 
START what would the first projects be the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects STOP 
START the need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to UNK and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest STOP 
START there would however be a variety of other skills medical agricultural engineering which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of UNK UNK to existing development projects STOP 
START the first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in latin america africa and asia STOP 
START 10 STOP 
START UNK will the peace corps be received abroad the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the united states will vary from country to country STOP 
START a certain UNK about the coming of americans is to be expected in many quarters STOP 
START UNK political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active UNK STOP 
START but there are indications that many developing nations will welcome peace corps volunteers and that if the volunteers are well chosen they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends STOP 
START it is important however that the peace corps be advanced not as an arm of the cold war but as a contribution to the world community STOP 
START in UNK it to other governments and to the united nations we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the united nations sponsor the idea and form an international UNK committee STOP 
START we should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands STOP 
START in any case our peace corps personnel should be offered as UNK UNK in development projects of the u.n. and other international agencies STOP 
START the peace corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership STOP 
START our aim must be to learn as much as we teach STOP 
START the peace corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the united states the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower STOP 
START if presented in this spirit the response and the results will be UNK better STOP 
START 11 STOP 
START UNK will it be financed already appropriated funds within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act are the only immediately available source of financing this UNK pilot programs of the peace corps STOP 
START if it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds in order to carry out the purposes of the mutual security act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign to the world STOP 
START congress should then be asked to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year STOP 
START specifically congress should consider UNK the peace corps to receive contributions from american businesses unions civic organizations and the public at large STOP 
START for this must be the project of the whole american people STOP 
START an advisory council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a UNK point for public understanding STOP 
START steps should also be taken to link the food for peace program with the peace corps so that foreign UNK UNK by the sale of u.s. surplus food under UNK UNK can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of peace corps personnel STOP 
START the extent to which participating bodies such as u. s. voluntary agencies universities international organizations and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the peace corps programs must be fully explored STOP 
START 12 STOP 
START UNK it worth the cost and the UNK matter how well conceived and UNK run there probably will be UNK STOP 
START these could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad STOP 
START but as the popular response suggests the UNK of the peace corps is very great STOP 
START it can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions STOP 
START it can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country STOP 
START it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world STOP 
START with thousands of young americans going to work in developing areas millions of americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before STOP 
START with colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program and with students looking toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student UNK STOP 
START the letters home the talks later given by returning members of the peace corps the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policies toward the world STOP 
START and this is meeting the world's need too since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world STOP 
START the peace corps thus can add a new dimension to america's world policy one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting STOP 
START as you said in your state of the union message the problems are towering and unprecedented and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well STOP 
START to the congress of the united states i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corps a pool of trained american men and women sent overseas by the u.s. government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower STOP 
START i have today signed an executive order establishing a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis STOP 
START the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in UNK more effective plans for a permanent organization STOP 
START in addition by starting the peace corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall STOP 
START this temporary peace corps is being established under existing authority in the mutual security act and will be located in the department of state STOP 
START its initial expenses will be paid from UNK currently available for our foreign aid program STOP 
START throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires STOP 
START our own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity UNK from the bonds of hunger ignorance and poverty STOP 
START one of the greatest UNK to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly UNK economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages the mountains the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations STOP 
START the vast task of economic development UNK requires skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the schools construct development projects demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge STOP 
START to meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are UNK the establishment of a peace corps an organization which will UNK and train american volunteers sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations STOP 
START this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work STOP 
START they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice STOP 
START there is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them STOP

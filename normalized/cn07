START let's move STOP 
START they filed out through the UNK door into the UNK square STOP 
START there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to UNK but they were in other cell blocks STOP 
START there was no chance STOP 
START they moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall STOP 
START there was no moon STOP 
START they had chosen this night UNK STOP 
START they reached the guard house without UNK the men on the walls above and powers slipped through the door STOP 
START two men were on duty inside playing UNK relaxed STOP

START the sergeant UNK STOP 
START powers had not followed STOP 
START powers was covering the remaining guard STOP 
START the man UNK for the UNK of the alarm bell STOP 
START powers knocked his arm aside STOP 
START deliberately with none of UNK UNK he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the UNK head STOP 
START they were free STOP 
START even barton could not quite believe it STOP 
START it had gone without a UNK STOP 
START they slid through the UNK in the big gate UNK across the dark ground STOP 
START five minutes later they reached the horses STOP 
START barton was relieved to see that carl dill and UNK foster had brought extra UNK STOP 
START he had been worried that with miller and UNK added to the escape party they would be short STOP 
START no one hurried STOP 
START they walked the horses heading along the river barton and UNK foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night STOP 
START the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the UNK suits of UNK STOP 
START five miles STOP 
START in a small grove against the river they halted turning deep into the protection of the trees STOP 
START foster had brought extra clothing also STOP 
START a good man UNK STOP 
START he had been one of the original night riders one who had escaped the trial STOP 
START it was to him that barton had sent carl dill on UNK release from the prison STOP

START you're the only man the night riders will follow STOP 
START we've been UNK and i don't like to UNK STOP 
START barton turned away his eyes falling upon UNK beside his horse STOP 
START good luck STOP 
START the murderer lifted his head STOP 
START meaning you want me to ride out you aren't one of us STOP 
START there's nothing for you here STOP 
START i got no place to go STOP 
START barton hesitated STOP 
START he did not trust UNK his violent temper his killer instinct STOP 
START but ten years in prison had taught him realities STOP 
START they were in a fight UNK in both numbers and money STOP 
START it was all right to put a bunch of UNK onto horses to call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure STOP 
START but if they really hoped to succeed they needed UNK men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the UNK on the other side STOP 
START your choice he said briefly and turned to kid UNK STOP 
START UNK those uniforms so they won't be found STOP 
START then barton touched carl UNK arm and moved off up the river bank STOP 
START he wanted a careful UNK report from dill on the conditions in the valley STOP 
START they UNK on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a UNK in his breast pocket passing it over silently STOP 
START he too knew the UNK of going for weeks sometimes months without the UNK of tobacco STOP 
START mitchell barton drew in the UNK deeply letting the smoke lie warm and UNK in his throat for a moment before he UNK STOP 
START through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly STOP

START the UNK washed badly said dill but there's a trail you can get over with a horse STOP 
START a company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were UNK that trail STOP

START i've got to get the boy STOP 
START let's ride STOP 
START chapter two UNK men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places carrying away whole sections to make UNK more difficult STOP 
START it was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state STOP 
START it reached donald UNK in his massive home in UNK STOP 
START it reached the mines at north san UNK and UNK STOP 
START it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences STOP 
START for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder UNK and mitchell barton the UNK which could send it into explosive violence STOP 
START UNK UNK sat in his office above the UNK pit STOP 
START the office was of UNK four rooms each heated by an iron stove STOP 
START the building was UNK by the scene outside STOP

START a million UNK of gold a month STOP 
START a million tons of rock and soil and brush STOP 
START the UNK ran twenty-four hours each day STOP 
START their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred UNK could be heard for miles STOP 
START UNK like all who worked near the UNK was partly UNK from the constant assault against his UNK STOP 
START he was a big man wearing a neat UNK shirt against the cold UNK air STOP 
START fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt STOP 
START ten years older than UNK barton he had UNK his way up from UNK in the UNK to manager of the operation STOP 
START he was proud of his UNK proud of his job proud that donald UNK and his associates trusted him STOP 
START he lived and UNK for the mining company STOP 
START no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being UNK and UNK had made a virtue of UNK all of his life STOP 
START there came a ghost of noise at the office door and UNK swung to see UNK in the entrance from the outer room STOP 
START UNK had never accustomed himself to UNK STOP 
START the man was tall thin with a narrow face and a UNK nose STOP 
START the eyes always held UNK eyes of a dead man UNK as a UNK with the fixed intensity of a UNK STOP 
START even UNK was UNK by the UNK UNK that was UNK STOP 
START he knew nothing about the man's history STOP 
START UNK had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from UNK STOP

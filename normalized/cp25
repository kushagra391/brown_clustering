START UNK next interest seemed the product of his UNK STOP 
START his broad reading took him into certain UNK of religion and the subject of religion began to UNK him STOP 
START when he was twelve he took to reading st. UNK and UNK then UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK by endless UNK and numerous UNK papers STOP 
START for his birthday because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the UNK and a little image of the indian god UNK STOP 
START and one day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy STOP 
START he was UNK happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to read STOP 
START at dinner one night when he was fourteen richard announced there is only one god STOP 
START did you think there were two his father STOP 
START you don't understand richard said UNK STOP 
START through quiet laughter his mother said don't speak to your father like that richard STOP 
START richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again STOP 
START his interest in the formal study of religion UNK when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in UNK affairs STOP 
START although he still didn't speak to anyone he grew fond of saying the future lies in asia when the opportunity arose and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new york to give him a foundation they said for his life in UNK studies STOP 
START richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired in his UNK a thorough if UNK knowledge of UNK UNK literature life politics and history STOP 
START he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the UNK upon which he had been practicing and his image of UNK and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country STOP 
START the week at home was not comfortable STOP 
START his mother who had seen little of him for four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an UNK which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be UNK STOP 
START she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested STOP 
START do you still have the book of the dead asked him and laughing she added i was nervous about buying a book with a title like that but i knew you'd like it STOP 
START yes he UNK to UNK the conversation i still have it STOP 
START he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father no matter the subject STOP 
START as for the book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been UNK in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york STOP 
START he had UNK each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open the big furnace given them up to the flames STOP 
START then he UNK from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried STOP 
START richard left america with his clothes his UNK and his image of UNK and on the UNK which took him to japan he UNK at the UNK trying to make the sounds he UNK UNK an ancient japanese UNK he had once heard STOP 
START during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the UNK to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure STOP 
START he UNK from his cabin late that night and crept out into a UNK north pacific wind and dropped the UNK into the water STOP 
START it was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the UNK rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it STOP 
START it was as though the UNK had been eaten up by the wind STOP 
START in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his UNK with a friend STOP 
START an american student named charlotte adams had refused to take notice of his evident UNK to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her STOP 
START he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching UNK of tokyo STOP 
START in charlotte richard saw a UNK and a UNK for doing things which after a fashion he UNK STOP 
START in time he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity STOP 
START she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small UNK parties she held at her rooms and in the end he UNK with her wishes although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random UNK STOP 
START at one such gathering charlotte announced i was at UNK today STOP 
START have you ever been to UNK one had STOP 
START well it's at UNK and there was a UNK young man quite naked taking a shower in the pool STOP 
START i was thoroughly startled STOP 
START richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but UNK manner during the UNK was more UNK and UNK than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the UNK words which had preceded it STOP 
START three of the four persons present all foreign students in tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and tea were in because they could be taken UNK STOP 
START UNK was out because it was UNK STOP 
START UNK was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little UNK STOP 
START richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game the very sound of the UNK nearly painful to his ears STOP 
START he wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him said charlotte STOP 
START did you watch him a UNK girl named UNK UNK STOP 
START i shouldn't have been able to do that STOP 
START well i was able to do it charlotte said with no sign of UNK STOP 
START for a minute anyhow STOP 
START i'm surprised no one has been there STOP 
START i've been there a number of times STOP 
START sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo STOP 
START you've never been to UNK i've heard about it samuel burns said STOP 
START there's a little place there called UNK mound dedicated to UNK and UNK STOP 
START yes a little UNK place charlotte said and concluded anyhow it's all very nice STOP 
START and the man who brought sweet potatoes into UNK is buried there next to a beautiful seated statue of UNK STOP 
START oh that's what i meant to tell you STOP 
START this is the interesting part richard she had a UNK habit of trying to pull him into the talking STOP 
START there was that fellow out there in the bitter cold my god it was cold today said samuel burns STOP 
START UNK or UNK STOP 
START and the water would be still UNK UNK seemed to UNK at the thought of it STOP 
START and your golden god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured himself into a UNK bath STOP 
START it would kill one of us STOP 
START but the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked in a little stream of water at UNK all in worship of UNK the god of fire STOP 
START UNK dark eyes came up and seemed for the UNK moment to reflect sharp light STOP 
START it was true the god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of UNK STOP 
START the conversation went on but richard stopped listening STOP 
START he found himself trying to remember something but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall STOP 
START he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his UNK into the icy UNK of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching STOP 
START perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the UNK and the UNK at UNK he was unable to put it together STOP 
START that night after leaving UNK apartment richard walked about for a time before returning to his room STOP 
START when he at last did go to his room he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of UNK thinking first of UNK tale of the man at UNK then of his UNK and the UNK pacific waters STOP 
START and the next morning not sure of why he went he took the train to UNK and walked to UNK STOP 
START he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned STOP 
START he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and UNK at the two thin falls which dropped from large UNK high at the back of the pool STOP 
START on the UNK above was UNK what might have been an UNK of UNK or perhaps a UNK STOP 
START the strange creature housed in wire made him UNK STOP 
START the sensation he so UNK realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited to be UNK to the UNK green water or the little UNK or the green UNK UNK beyond his reach STOP 
START he left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him STOP 
START into a little well before the temple he dropped a UNK UNK and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze the spirit he wished to call out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest STOP 
START instead he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated UNK at their head STOP 
START the black UNK seemed to stare UNK back at him and UNK eyes were caught by the UNK in UNK and then richard was shocked as all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of UNK face and there was a terrible UNK UNK sound as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it STOP 
START then the flames were gone the UNK fell upon the severe black face and richard began to UNK violently STOP 
START suddenly he UNK his pockets of all his UNK and dropped them into the box before the seated UNK and hurried back down both UNK and away from the temple never looking back STOP 
START he walked all the miles back to his room STOP 
START he seemed to have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small UNK and felt a bit hot STOP 
START he stayed home reading and UNK to think about his frightening experience at UNK STOP 
START but the process of UNK to think about it was an active UNK in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day STOP 
START the cold UNK making sleep difficult that night and he remained in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about the UNK sight of burning metal the UNK sound the UNK feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life STOP 
START all of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at UNK STOP

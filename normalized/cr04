START up to date however his garden was still more or less of a mess he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it STOP 
START it wasn't his fault that these things were so STOP 
START the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its UNK of details which must be cleaned up immediately STOP 
START as a result life had become a kind of continuous UNK STOP 
START once he disposed of these items which screamed so UNK for attention he could undertake the things which really counted STOP 
START then at last his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read or garden or just UNK through the woods in the late afternoon accompanied by his dogs STOP 
START his dogs had almost forgotten them although they had played such an important part in his early dreams STOP 
START then they had always been UNK around him on these walks UNK with delight UNK off into the UNK on UNK hunting UNK returning to jump up on him UNK with UNK UNK STOP 
START dogs did something to one's ego STOP 
START they were constantly UNK you that you were one of the world's great guys STOP 
START regardless of how much of a UNK you knew yourself to be you could be certain they would never find out and even if they did it would make no difference STOP 
START now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture STOP 
START what in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous UNK STOP 
START why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to worried him this inability to get the UNK things done in the course of a day STOP 
START he would wake up in the middle of the night and UNK about it STOP 
START how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business raise a family be on half a dozen boards work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a UNK brief case it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed it be that it UNK up for the aged in some mysterious way as if a bored universe were UNK through the end of the chapter just to get it over with was the answer less metaphysical older people work more slowly it take a man of UNK longer to write a letter UNK clean out a barn read a newspaper than a man of thirty men become UNK as they grew older UNK UNK reluctant to let go might be that certain people were born with a UNK to UNK their lives while others could live UNK UNK almost UNK like UNK in the sun too UNK to UNK their eyes STOP 
START perhaps it was his UNK or good fortune UNK way one looked at it to belong to the former group and he was struggling UNK to build up pressure in a world which demanded none which was UNK UNK to it STOP 
START and then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement reading UNK UNK lying on his back and watching the clouds go by was because he didn't want to do them STOP 
START there was no UNK behind them STOP 
START they could be done or left UNK and nobody really gave a damn STOP 
START during all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done STOP 
START this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed UNK to do anything for which no one was waiting STOP 
START he looked at the luminous UNK of his UNK watch STOP 
START it was five minutes after four STOP 
START on some distant farm a UNK UNK and far down the valley an associate answered STOP 
START he turned over UNK and pulled the sheet over his head against the UNK UNK of the dawn STOP 
START at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop STOP 
START thus committed action might follow STOP 
START he went down to mills and UNK hardware store and bought a full set of UNK tools including a UNK power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr. mills said were essential for UNK and UNK whatever they were STOP 
START he also bought a huge square of UNK for hanging up his tools and lumber for his UNK UNK and UNK and UNK nails levels and t squares and UNK lines and several UNK that he had no idea how to use or what they were for STOP 
START there said mr. mills STOP 
START UNK get you started STOP 
START best not to get everything at once STOP 
START add things as you find you need 'em STOP 
START he didn't even ask the cost of this collection STOP 
START after all if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that STOP 
START when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools UNK had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using the recently purchased second car STOP 
START he was glad STOP 
START it gave him a chance to UNK the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a UNK of acid comments STOP 
START he had made such a UNK about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable STOP 
START he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall STOP 
START that was where the UNK would go on which he would hang his hand tools STOP 
START in front of it would be his UNK STOP 
START the old UNK which had caused him so many UNK hours came UNK in on him once more only this time he couldn't UNK it with a sleeping pill and send it away STOP 
START how in the world did one attach a UNK to a stone wall did one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter the UNK there would be the UNK STOP 
START he sat down on an old box and focused on the problem STOP 
START perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric UNK STOP 
START but then when you stuck things into the holes why didn't they come right out again all seemed rather hopeless STOP 
START he turned his attention to the UNK STOP 
START perhaps that was the first thing to do STOP 
START a UNK had a heavy top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't UNK like a UNK calf and ultimately UNK when you leaned on it mills had done some UNK on a UNK of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and UNK which properly handled would he had assured him turn into a UNK STOP 
START they lay on the cellar floor in a UNK pile STOP 
START mr. crombie UNK at it UNK with his foot STOP 
START how could anyone know what to do with an UNK like that he had better have someone help him put up the UNK and build the UNK someone who knew what he was about STOP 
START then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on STOP 
START after that everything should be simpler STOP 
START he went upstairs to phone UNK STOP 
START to his UNK he reached him STOP 
START mr. UNK was laid up with a bad cold STOP 
START he didn't seem to think that UNK a UNK to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the UNK equally lightly STOP 
START the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job STOP 
START that was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch STOP 
START no he didn't know of any UNK STOP 
START there wasn't any such thing any more STOP 
START UNK all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could UNK nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job STOP 
START there was a fellow named UNK over UNK way STOP 
START nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk STOP 
START mr. UNK would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night STOP 
START if he was sober which was doubtful he'd have him get in touch with mr. crombie STOP 
START mr. UNK had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest UNK that had come into mr. UNK life since he moved to UNK in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time and he didn't like to work at all unless mr. crombie hung around and talked to him STOP 
START he said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the UNK in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you STOP 
START so mr. crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr. UNK mind from funny things STOP 
START at the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached UNK to stone walls but mr. UNK was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to UNK his ignorance STOP 
START while mr. UNK was putting up the UNK and starting the UNK mr. crombie told him of this idea about UNK the whole end of the cellar STOP 
START mr. UNK agreed that this would be pretty STOP 
START without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards UNK over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the UNK which he then stained and UNK according to his taste STOP 
START now he said we got to put in some UNK for them power tools a couple of UNK UNK over the UNK UNK i guess we're about through down here STOP 
START it all did look very efficient and UNK STOP 
START there was no question of that STOP 
START by the way said mr. UNK packing his tools into a UNK UNK them power tools needs extra voltage STOP 
START i guess you know about that STOP 
START before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new UNK box for the extra UNK STOP 
START that ain't too bad UNK the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do UNK STOP 
START instead of being depressed by this news mr. crombie was actually relieved STOP 
START at least the moment was UNK when he had to face the mystery of the power tools STOP 
START he followed mr. UNK up the cellar stairs STOP 
START as usual mrs. crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK sat down in the only UNK kitchen chair STOP 
START well he said got your man fixed up nice down there STOP 
START he UNK be able to build a new house with all them UNK STOP 
START mr. crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression STOP 
START i was just UNK to him that i'm all ready now for anything else you want done STOP 
START mr. crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing STOP 
START oh that's wonderful cried mrs. crombie STOP 
START i have a thousand things for you to do STOP 
START doors that won't open and doors that won't close and UNK and broken but those are the things i built the workshop for protested mr. crombie STOP 
START those are the things i can do now that i'm set up STOP 
START i've been waiting to get these things done for months she said STOP 
START we won't live long enough if i wait for you besides which you don't need to worry UNK be plenty more STOP 
START but the discussion was academic STOP 
START mr. UNK was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink STOP

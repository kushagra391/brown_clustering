START i don't really believe in intuition STOP 
START but i UNK to you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a bad day STOP 
START part of it was the weather so UNK it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital STOP 
START part of it was being so tired i'd not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well that kept me up late STOP 
START but the rest of it the main part wasn't based on logic at all STOP 
START it was just going to be one of those days STOP 
START for the UNK time i wished i'd chosen some nice UNK UNK profession STOP 
START and for the UNK time i answered myself STOP 
START i hadn't chosen medicine it had chosen me STOP 
START actually i shouldn't complain i told myself in the UNK mirror STOP 
START i had a lot to be UNK for STOP 
START a profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be UNK at STOP 
START maybe i didn't see as much of UNK as i'd like but how much worse it would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice went send my daughter to an UNK or a UNK STOP 
START at least we were together and we had mrs. hodges UNK her to look after us no mother could be UNK of UNK than mrs. hodges was STOP 
START i was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it STOP 
START especially in the way UNK had turned out STOP 
START growing up without a mother from the time she was three it wasn't a good thing for a child even knowing the kind of mother alice had been STOP 
START but i UNK start on alice STOP 
START she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look at STOP 
START if she'd kept on as she'd been going the story i'd told UNK would probably have been true by now anyhow as usual UNK bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table STOP 
START her first class wasn't until ten but she always got up to have breakfast with me STOP 
START it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided all on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too STOP 
START oh i knew that i couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision STOP 
START i had a feeling that young pete UNK the most promising UNK at UNK had something to do with it too STOP 
START she'd been out with pete the night before and her gay UNK about their date UNK my mood a little STOP 
START but once i was alone again driving to the hospital the UNK returned STOP 
START if she and pete were really getting serious i'd have to do some hard thinking STOP 
START should i tell him the truth about alice he have a right to know the secret i'd kept from UNK all these years boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to UNK STOP 
START two UNK and dick UNK the other resident STOP 
START i'm chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with me taking the boys on the rounds STOP 
START pete was down on seven dick told me and he'd meet us there STOP 
START there wasn't anything of special interest that morning no one UNK than they should have been STOP 
START pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven he'd had a case of UNK shock but it was all taken care of now STOP 
START seven is a women's floor and as it happened not very busy right then STOP 
START when we'd finished our regular rounds pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor STOP 
START got a new one in last night he said STOP 
START i haven't seen her yet but i hear she's a UNK wasn't surprised STOP 
START the ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female UNK STOP 
START we didn't get many at UNK and they were never pretty sights STOP 
START it was thought UNK to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular UNK ward STOP 
START the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed STOP 
START they'd cleaned her up some of course and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk STOP 
START but there was something about her and i felt my lips forming a name STOP 
START alice but this woman's name was rose UNK looked at the chart for UNK STOP 
START yes rose UNK diagnosis acute UNK STOP 
START she looked about sixty though i recalled that the chart gave her age as UNK STOP 
START an ugly UNK UNK the somewhat familiar UNK face already UNK by the UNK network of broken red UNK that heavy UNK carry STOP 
START her UNK hair was UNK UNK blonde and its real dirty gray STOP 
START oh could it be no it was an unfortunate resemblance that was all it was and i turned to dick forcing myself to put my UNK out of my mind STOP 
START in a low voice dick filled us in she'd been picked up downtown passed out in the doorway STOP 
START although quiet when they brought her in she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out STOP 
START it was the old story STOP 
START we'd keep her a day or two and the UNK people would talk to her STOP 
START but if she wasn't interested she'd just go back to the same life she'd left STOP 
START turning toward the patient again i i can't describe what happened to me then except to say that i felt sick STOP 
START i tell you it took every UNK of control i had to be able to speak STOP 
START now miss or is it mrs. UNK never liked going straight into an examination with patients it UNK them i've always thought to UNK first STOP 
START this was one time i'd have UNK broken my own rule but habit was too strong STOP 
START hey voice was flat and dull STOP 
START but those penetrating eyes i had to turn my head away STOP 
START it was then that i saw what the UNK covers revealed STOP 
START there were UNK on the sheet STOP 
START what's this asked STOP 
START your period shook her head STOP 
START i been UNK a little now and then she said quietly no emotion in her voice STOP 
START have you spoken to a doctor about it again there was a negative shake STOP 
START i told miss UNK to move her down the hall where we had an UNK table STOP 
START better do a UNK i told pete STOP 
START it was only a few moments before miss UNK had her in the proper position for a UNK but i couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination STOP 
START pete stood by with a slide and took the UNK sent it down to the UNK with a request for the test STOP 
START that done i told miss UNK to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind STOP 
START i was busy the rest of the day STOP 
START late in the afternoon i was up on seven again STOP 
START one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled STOP 
START on my way to the elevator i ran into pete STOP 
START i've got the results on the UNK UNK test he said STOP 
START there's something there all right STOP 
START class three they said STOP 
START do you want to talk to her doctor well i didn't i didn't ever want to see that woman again STOP 
START but that was ridiculous of course STOP 
START all right STOP 
START we'll do a d. and c. and get her permission for a UNK STOP 
START maybe it's nothing maybe it's UNK or in UNK can't take any chances STOP 
START if you can keep her here that long pete said UNK STOP 
START UNK tells me she's started UNK already wants to get out STOP 
START wants to get to her UNK i guess STOP 
START i UNK in UNK STOP 
START well better see what i can do STOP 
START we'd been standing right outside miss UNK door and as i went to turn the UNK to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly UNK STOP 
START but she seemed to be UNK and in any case we'd been talking in low tones STOP 
START her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though and once again i felt an UNK UNK STOP 
START i sure can't complain about the service in this place she said STOP 
START i just got through seeing one of you guys STOP 
START what do you want was something almost UNK in her tone but i UNK it STOP 
START i've just been talking to dr. UNK i said STOP 
START we'd like you to have a UNK and UNK STOP 
START that's quite minor nothing to worry about STOP 
START but we would like your permission to do that is to go further if it proves necessary STOP 
START no STOP 
START it was flat definite STOP 
START suppose you let me explain STOP 
START actually i rather doubt that we'll have to do this STOP 
START even if we do you'll be out of here in a week probably STOP 
START i was sure that was the difficulty she just didn't want to stay here where she couldn't get to the liquor STOP 
START no STOP 
START i looked at her in UNK STOP 
START i'd had patients UNK refused UNK before of course but never one who didn't show in one way or another the reason why STOP 
START mostly it was fear but this woman's voice didn't UNK and her hands were still on the UNK STOP 
START will you tell me why asked STOP 
START she smiled a smile without humor STOP 
START you shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door she said STOP 
START i've got cancer haven't i went on UNK my protests STOP 
START i'm not going to be one of your UNK UNK STOP 
START let your pupils learn on someone else doctor STOP 
START just let me die in peace STOP 
START i stared at her almost UNK STOP 
START her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought she was STOP 
START even her voice had taken on a more UNK tone STOP 
START this was someone UNK come down in the world i thought STOP 
START a long long way down STOP 
START again there was something familiar about her something you haven't got cancer i said as strongly as i could STOP 
START i don't know what you heard that would make you think so but i assure you i don't even know myself so how can you be so sure even if don't give me a lot of talk joe STOP 
START i UNK at her STOP 
START she could have found out my first name of course that wouldn't be difficult STOP 
START but there was that something some UNK in the way she spoke STOP 
START she was watching me UNK a funny little UNK on her lips STOP 
START surprised baby i've changed haven't i you haven't changed much joe STOP 
START i knew then knew with a UNK shock STOP 
START alice i UNK through dry lips STOP 
START alice for goodness sake alice she UNK UNK STOP 
START what's the matter joe you scared of me i'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife don't worry STOP 
START just let me UNK here but why did you come back found my voice STOP 
START where have you been all these years shrugged STOP 
START here and there STOP 
START as for coming back here well i'll tell you the truth i didn't even know where i was when i came to STOP 
START the last thing i remember is a bar in san UNK the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her UNK UNK made me UNK STOP 
START and this was UNK mother i never asked you for any UNK joe she went on but i'm asking one now STOP 
START let me UNK here doctors are all alike all you want is to cut up people and what's the good i want out joe looked at the UNK UNK of a woman before me STOP 
START let her out let her out that would be the solution wouldn't it she'd said was true in all these years she'd never asked for anything from me STOP 
START if i let her go she'd disappear once more STOP 
START and UNK would be safe STOP

START a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end STOP 
START but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away STOP 
START the man was king UNK 2 of the belgians who in UNK concluded that he had better grab a colony while the UNK was still good STOP 
START by force he took under his protection or UNK UNK square miles of wilderness in central africa STOP 
START this is an area nearly as large as western europe it was filled then as now by UNK tribes with no political or historical unity STOP 
START its boundaries had nothing to do with UNK or ethnic UNK were determined by the points at which UNK UNK and UNK got tired of walking STOP 
START the population of the congo is UNK million divided into at least seven major culture UNK and UNK tribes speaking 400 separate UNK STOP 
START the religions of the people include christianity UNK UNK UNK worship and UNK STOP 
START the climate UNK from the UNK UNK to the UNK STOP 
START the hospitals contain patients UNK by UNK or run over by sports cars STOP 
START to make one nation out of these UNK would be a problem large enough in any case has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done or failed to do in the congo since UNK STOP 
START at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property STOP 
START but by UNK its record of brutality had touched the national conscience STOP 
START the belgian government itself took over administration UNK a program of UNK UNK in the history of UNK STOP 
START one definition of UNK is the principle or practice on the part of a government of UNK the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children STOP 
START the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned only their judgment STOP 
START ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child if one UNK him to have been born in UNK was UNK and had until then been treated as an infant STOP 
START the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in copper tin UNK UNK UNK and UNK and cotton and palm oil STOP 
START the colony was administered from UNK with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote STOP 
START the UNK of this administration were a number of huge UNK in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock STOP 
START in inside africa john UNK describes one of these the UNK UNK as the kind of UNK that might be UNK if let us say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were UNK together with the united states government as a heavy partner STOP 
START had they been truly UNK the belgians might have UNK the congolese without UNK STOP 
START but they were not STOP 
START they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent put much effort into public housing STOP 
START they also instituted a UNK system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food STOP 
START but instead of UNK the UNK either in actual commodities or in cash at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged to UNK it out more often STOP 
START would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry belgians also placed great emphasis on education STOP 
START during the UNK there were as many as UNK schools in the congo STOP 
START but almost all the schools were primary STOP 
START the average congolese can do little more than UNK out the meaning of la UNK and le UNK and write his name STOP 
START some schools were technical the belgians needed UNK and mechanics to help UNK the land and trained many STOP 
START but they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college STOP 
START it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some UNK future some might be ready to UNK history economics and political science STOP 
START indeed the belgians discouraged higher education UNK the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause UNK STOP 
START when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were among its UNK million people exactly 14 university graduates STOP 
START why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so UNK UNK to accept it one large UNK it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the UNK of nationalism sweeping africa STOP 
START they lacked time to prepare the congo as the british and french had prepared their UNK STOP 
START the congolese were UNK for their independence even though most were UNK what it meant in UNK street crowds shouted UNK UNK UNK de sang not one drop of blood STOP 
START the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the UNK UNK than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess STOP 
START it is hard to blame them for this STOP 
START yet there were other UNK and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them UNK STOP 
START as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than UNK political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate STOP 
START there were four principal ones STOP 
START first there were those congolese among them joseph UNK who favored UNK the country into small independent states UNK it STOP 
START second there were those UNK UNK who favored UNK a loose UNK having a central government of limited authority with much power UNK in the states STOP 
START third there were those notably UNK lumumba who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government STOP 
START and fourth there were UNK who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up STOP 
START however the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting STOP 
START a final factor which contributed greatly to the UNK of the congo immediately after independence was the UNK structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration STOP 
START they had divided the congo into six provinces UNK UNK UNK katanga UNK and eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic UNK STOP 
START thus some provinces contained tribes which UNK each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war STOP 
START the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a UNK UNK form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a UNK legislature elected by universal UNK in the provinces STOP 
START UNK around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations STOP 
START if internal UNK arose they could be handled by the UNK congolese army the force UNK which had been trained and was still UNK by white belgians STOP 
START the president joseph UNK seemed an able administrator and the premier UNK lumumba a reasonable man STOP 
START twenty-four hours after independence the wild UNK UNK fighting each other STOP 
START presently the UNK members of the force UNK many of them drawn from savage and even UNK tribes UNK in UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START terror UNK the thousands of belgian UNK who had remained in the country STOP 
START the belgian government decided to act and on july 10 UNK UNK to the congo STOP 
START on july 11 the head of the UNK province of katanga UNK UNK announced that his province had UNK from the country STOP 
START confusion became chaos UNK day brought new acts of violence STOP 
START lumumba and UNK UNK it all on the military intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations to send troops to UNK them STOP 
START on july 14 the security council with france and great britain UNK voted the resolution which drew the u.n. into the congo STOP 
START vague in UNK it called for UNK of belgian troops and authorized the UNK to take the necessary steps to provide the congolese government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks STOP 
START UNK hammarskjold decided that it would be UNK if the u.n. troops sent into the congo were to come from african or at least UNK nations certainly not from the u.s. russia great britain or france STOP 
START he quickly called on UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK which UNK troops within hours STOP 
START ultimately the u.n. army in the congo reached a top strength of UNK including about UNK from india and a few soldiers from UNK and UNK who were the only whites STOP 
START it took the u.n. three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo STOP 
START the belgians were reluctant to UNK their troops and often UNK u.n. efforts STOP 
START the wildly UNK nature of UNK lumumba caused constant problems he frequently announced that he wanted the u.n. to get out of the congo along with the belgians and appealed to russia for help STOP 
START however there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist STOP 
START before appealing to the u.n. or to russia he first appealed to the u.s. for military help and was rejected STOP 
START lumumba further complicated the UNK mission by UNK small wars with the UNK province of katanga and with south UNK which under albert UNK wanted to UNK as well STOP 
START meanwhile russia took every opportunity to UNK in the congo sending lumumba equipment for his wars UNK technicians and even threatening on occasion to UNK openly STOP 
START but by the end of the UNK period in october 1960 something approaching calm settled on the congo STOP 
START president UNK became UNK with lumumba and fired him STOP 
START lumumba fired UNK STOP 
START control of the government such control as there was and such government as there was passed into the hands of joseph UNK chief of staff of the congolese army STOP 
START UNK promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have UNK their UNK efforts at u.n. headquarters in new york STOP 
START the belgians at least officially UNK from the congo as well UNK all of their UNK troops STOP 
START but they left behind them large numbers of officers UNK called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of UNK UNK in katanga the UNK province which according to UNK holds UNK of the mineral wealth of the entire country STOP 
START from october 1960 to february 1961 the u.n. forces in the congo took little action STOP 
START there was no UNK for it the security UNK resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not UNK in the political affairs of any nation whether to UNK it UNK it or UNK it STOP 
START during the UNK UNK civil war UNK and UNK throughout the congo STOP 
START in february the murder of UNK lumumba who had been UNK into katanga and executed on order of UNK again stirred the u.n. to action STOP 
START on feb. 21 the council passed another resolution UNK the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including the use of force if necessary in the last resort STOP 
START although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably UNK than the earlier one STOP 
START it also urged that the u.n. UNK and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers an investigation of UNK death the UNK of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army STOP

START every library UNK or at least those whose taste goes beyond the UNK fiction UNK knows what it is to hear the UNK say UNK i'm sorry but we don't have that book STOP 
START there wouldn't be much demand for it i'm afraid STOP 
START behind this reply and its many variations is the UNK budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest STOP 
START what to buy out of the year's UNK of nearly UNK book titles to buy for adult and child readers for UNK of fiction and UNK for a UNK whose wants are UNK UNK when your budget is UNK small library UNK are UNK inadequate STOP 
START a UNK high percentage do not exceed $500 annually which includes the UNK salary and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs this in the world's UNK city STOP 
START the UNK of a small community library is UNK worse STOP 
START confronted with this situation most libraries either UNK the severe limitations of their UNK and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the UNK of UNK and local governments to supplement their annual funds STOP 
START in some parts of the country however a UNK movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a UNK or regional basis STOP 
START new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these UNK systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow STOP 
START because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new york UNK offers a UNK of how the plan works STOP 
START at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large UNK populated area STOP 
START at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system in a UNK area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve STOP 
START both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state STOP 
START it was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the UNK systems of today STOP 
START under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts STOP 
START an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit STOP 
START some library boards are UNK of the plan STOP 
START a large UNK library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great STOP 
START a small library may UNK its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board STOP 
START within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved STOP 
START the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system STOP 
START all services are given without cost to members STOP 
START so obvious are these advantages that nearly UNK per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system and enthusiastic UNK UNK the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a UNK STOP 
START to set up a UNK library system the law requires a central book collection of UNK UNK volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it STOP 
START the collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection STOP 
START each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency STOP 
START the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library UNK a certain number of dollars STOP 
START in nassau county for example the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since 1950 STOP 
START this system by virtue of its variety and size offers an UNK view of the plan in operation STOP 
START the nassau system UNK that its major task it to UNK reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area STOP 
START the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford STOP 
START nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its UNK headquarters which will reach its goal of UNK volumes by UNK STOP 
START the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers STOP 
START basic reference tools are the UNK of the collection but there is also UNK in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries STOP 
START on UNK headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in UNK to the present day as well as bound volumes of important UNK STOP 
START the entire headquarters collection is available to the UNK of all members on UNK loans STOP 
START headquarters gets about 100 requests every day STOP 
START it is connected by UNK with the state library in albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide STOP 
START the books are carried around by truck in canvas UNK from headquarters to the other libraries STOP 
START each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon STOP 
START east meadow has philosophy psychology and religion houses social science pure science and language biography and education are centered in UNK has applied science business and literature UNK is the UNK of art music and foreign languages STOP 
START the reference UNK at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local UNK in helping to strengthen local reference service STOP 
START this kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course STOP 
START public libraries in nassau county have been UNK books to each other by mail for a UNK but the system UNK this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis STOP 
START local libraries find too that the new plan UNK tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger UNK than would be available to an individual library STOP 
START the system passes on these savings to its members STOP 
START further money is saved through economy in UNK and UNK detail as the result of central UNK STOP 
START books are not the only UNK of the system STOP 
START schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for UNK art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities STOP 
START the most recent film UNK available at each library lists UNK titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge STOP 
START this UNK lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some UNK cut across age groups such as UNK of the north the UNK UNK and the red UNK STOP 
START UNK are conducted by the UNK UNK consultant for the UNK of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service STOP 
START the system well UNK that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together an experienced children's UNK at headquarters UNK a guidance program designed to promote UNK library activities UNK with the children's UNK in member libraries by means of individual conferences UNK and frequent visits STOP 
START headquarters has also set up a central juvenile UNK and UNK center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection STOP 
START sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where UNK may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups STOP 
START story hours UNK programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant STOP 
START headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries STOP 
START in addition to the UNK loan service and the children's program headquarters has a public relations director who UNK to get wider UNK support for quality library service in the county UNK cooperative displays UNK UNK UNK and other UNK material for use in member libraries maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used it UNK sum and substance a monthly UNK which reports the UNK activities to the UNK and trustees of member libraries STOP 
START the system itself is governed by a board of trustees UNK representing its membership STOP 
START in nassau as in other systems the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general STOP 
START UNK a patient breed of men and women who have UNK much with dedication can begin to see results today STOP 
START library use is UNK daily and the bulk of the UNK are those UNK americans the teen-agers STOP 
START to them especially the UNK with the help of UNK hope they will never have to say i'm sorry we don't have that book STOP 
START today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned STOP 
START the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated UNK in the western world STOP 
START the need for UNK reading is apparent STOP 
START education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society STOP 
START the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life STOP 
START we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read we are not UNK in our reading we do not know how to use what we do read STOP 
START we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word STOP 
START a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries STOP 
START although progress has been made in america's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america STOP 
START the problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand STOP 
START the UNK of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition STOP 
START there are for example approximately UNK people in this country with no public library service and about UNK with inadequate service STOP 
START in college libraries UNK per cent of the total number of books are owned by UNK of UNK institutions UNK last year by the u.s. office of education STOP 
START and over UNK per cent of the elementary schools with UNK or more pupils do not have any library at all STOP 
START in every aspect of service to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities the library of today is failing to render UNK needed services STOP 
START only public understanding and support can provide that service STOP 
START this is one of the main reasons for national library week april UNK and for its theme for a UNK UNK life read STOP

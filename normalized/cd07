START the lord is my light and my salvation shall i fear lord is the strength of my life whom shall i be afraid UNK 27 1 a certain teacher scheduled a fear party for her fourth grade pupils STOP 
START it was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely STOP 
START the teacher thought it was so successful that she asks wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar UNK of their fears and worries george w. UNK a medical UNK thinks it would STOP 
START he says that would reduce UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors STOP 
START of this number 50% or 10 million patients have no UNK physical UNK whatever STOP 
START they are worry UNK STOP 
START yet they keep running from one physician to another largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles STOP 
START one of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group UNK where people could admit of their inner tensions STOP 
START we are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days STOP 
START it must be getting more serious STOP 
START people are giving their doctors a hard time STOP 
START one doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles and he reported that UNK of them worried about things that never happened of them worried about past UNK which were completely beyond their control of them worried about their health although their UNK were imaginary of them worried about their friends neighbors and relatives most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves STOP 
START only UNK of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention STOP 
START well most of our fears may be UNK but after you discover that fact you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fears is the real cause of them is there about us that makes us so anxious at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries STOP 
START we spend millions of dollars every year on fortune UNK and UNK STOP 
START we spend UNK of dollars at the race tracks and more UNK on other forms of gambling STOP 
START we spend UNK of dollars on liquor and many more UNK on various forms of UNK entertainment STOP 
START we UNK tons of UNK and UNK and sleeping UNK in order to get a UNK relief from the tensions that are UNK us apart STOP 
START a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our UNK parks and after he had seen it all he said to a friend you must be a very sad people STOP 
START sad was not the right word of course STOP 
START he should have said UNK for that's what we are STOP 
START and that's worse than sad STOP 
START watch people UNK to UNK houses cocktail UNK and night clubs that UNK continuous entertainment which means an endless flow of noise and UNK by paid UNK who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of UNK UNK watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something STOP 
START in one of his writings UNK speaks of this UNK for UNK as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot UNK without such UNK STOP 
START yes and as tension UNK in this world fear is increasing STOP 
START does that explain why there is now such a big UNK in the bomb shelter business have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons UNK things which are too horrible to UNK STOP 
START i doubt that fear parties and group UNK will help very much STOP 
START suppose we do get our fears out in the open what then that where most of them are already right out on the front page of our newspapers we are talking about them too much STOP 
START the question is what are we going to do about them the enemy will UNK on our fears if he can STOP 
START UNK did just that 23 years ago building up tensions that first led to a UNK and then to a world war STOP 
START the fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise or too UNK and too nervous to UNK for peace as long as there is any chance to UNK STOP 
START it is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that UNK animals to attack STOP 
START it could have the same effect on communists STOP 
START the president of the united states has said we will never UNK out of fear and we will never fear to UNK STOP 
START that is a sound position but it is important that moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid STOP 
START and that's another reason why it is UNK for us these days to UNK our fears to develop the UNK that UNK peace STOP 
START turning to the word of god we find the only sure way to do that STOP 
START in UNK 27 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that UNK you or to drive them out if they have you in their grip the lord is my light and my salvation shall i fear lord is the strength of my life whom shall i be afraid you say those are beautiful words all right but it was easy for the UNK to sing them in his day STOP 
START he didn't live in a world of UNK UNK like ours STOP 
START he didn't know anything about the problems we face today STOP 
START no the next two UNK when the UNK even mine enemies and my UNK came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell STOP 
START though an host should UNK against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident STOP 
START that is almost a perfect description of the UNK in which we find ourselves today isn't it enemy is also threatening to UNK us STOP 
START he has already UNK huge areas of the world putting men behind concrete walls and iron UNK and barbed wire reducing them to slavery UNK UNK not only their bodies but their souls and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison STOP 
START yes indeed we too can see a UNK host of UNK UNK against us STOP 
START what a terrible thing that UNK wall in berlin man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family STOP 
START another man tried to swim across the river from the east to the west but was shot and killed STOP 
START a middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall she threw out a few UNK and then jumped was UNK injured STOP 
START the entrance to a church has been UNK up so that the congregation most of which is in the western sector cannot worship god there UNK STOP 
START practically everybody in berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city STOP 
START people stand at the wall giving UNK to their feelings UNK UNK it with their fists pleading for loved ones STOP 
START but the enemy answers them from UNK that UNK out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible UNK STOP 
START there is only one escape left a tragic one and too many people are taking it suicide STOP 
START the normal rate of UNK in east berlin was one a day but since the border was closed on august 13 it has jumped to 25 a day things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door STOP 
START we are all involved in them deeply involved STOP 
START and nobody knows what comes next STOP 
START we live from crisis to crisis STOP 
START and there is only one way for a man to UNK his fears in such a world STOP 
START he must learn to say with true faith what the UNK said in a similar world the lord is my light and my salvation shall i fear lord is the strength of my life whom shall i be afraid that this man had a UNK conception of god which is the secret of his faith STOP 
START first the lord is my light STOP 
START he lived in a very dark world but he was not in the dark STOP 
START the same god who called this world into being when he said let there be light those were his very first creative words he began the world with light this god still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness STOP 
START for those who put their trust in him he still says every day again let there be light there is light fact he came into this world himself in the person of his son jesus christ who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said i am the light of the world he that UNK me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life STOP 
START the UNK could say that god was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of christ STOP 
START he lived in the dawn could only see the light coming over the horizon STOP 
START we live in the bright daylight of that great event us it is a fact in history STOP 
START why should we not have the same faith and an even greater experience of the light which it gives is the faith that moved the UNK to add his second conception of god the lord is my salvation STOP 
START he knew that his god would save him from his enemies because he had saved him from his sins STOP 
START if god could do that he could do anything STOP 
START the enemies at his gate threatening to eat up his flesh were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul STOP 
START and god had UNK that one by his grace why worry about all the others UNK paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament he that UNK not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely give us all things god be for us who can be against us shall separate us from the love of christ UNK or distress or UNK or UNK or UNK or UNK or UNK UNK 31 32 35 salvation is the key to the UNK of fear STOP 
START this gets down to the heart of our problem for it UNK us with god whom we fear most of all because we have UNK against him STOP 
START when that fear has been removed by faith in jesus christ when we know that he is our UNK that he has paid our debt with his blood that he has met the demands of god's justice and thus has turned his UNK away when we know that we have peace with god in our hearts then with this god on our side we can face the whole world without fear STOP 
START and so the UNK gives us one more picture of god the lord is the strength of my life STOP 
START the word is really UNK STOP 
START it recalls those words of another UNK god is our UNK and strength a very present help in trouble STOP 
START therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come UNK the works of the lord what UNK he UNK made in the earth STOP

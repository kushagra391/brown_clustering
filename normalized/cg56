START criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for our study of three UNK if we see how certain critics in the past have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature STOP 
START i have chosen five contrasting pairs ten men in all and they are arranged in roughly UNK order STOP 
START such a list must naturally be selective and the treatment of each man is brief for i am interested only in their general ideas on the moral measure of literature STOP 
START altogether the list will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones for these critics range all the way from UNK to those who consider art above ethics all the way from plato to UNK STOP 
START and most of the great periods are represented because we will compare plato and aristotle from the golden age of greece UNK and sir philip UNK from renaissance england johnson and william UNK of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in england james russell UNK and UNK UNK UNK of nineteenth century american letters STOP 
START plato and aristotle plato and aristotle agree on some vital literary issues STOP 
START they both measure literature by moral standards and in their political writings both allow for UNK but the differences between them are also significant STOP 
START while aristotle UNK literature only for the young plato would UNK all poets from his ideal state STOP 
START even more important in his UNK aristotle UNK somewhat from plato when he moves in the direction of treating literature as a unique thing separate and apart from its causes and its effects STOP 
START all through the republic plato UNK to the way art UNK to the general life and ultimately to a good life for his citizens STOP 
START in short he is constantly concerned with the ethical effects STOP 
START when he UNK the subject matter of poetry he asks what moral effect the scenes will have STOP 
START when he turns briefly to literary style in the third book he again looks to the effect on the audience STOP 
START he explains that his citizens must not be UNK by any of the UNK of the gods or heroes that one finds in much poetry and he UNK that all these UNK gentlemen will be sent to another state STOP 
START only those story UNK will remain who can UNK the style of the UNK STOP 
START plato is at times just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he is of their work STOP 
START when he UNK UNK in the eighth book of the republic he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst UNK STOP 
START but the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears in the UNK book and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms STOP 
START in plato's mind there is an UNK conflict between the poet and the philosopher because the poet UNK only particular objects and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction much less the highest level of ideal forms STOP 
START true reality of course is the ideal and the poet knows nothing of this the philosopher knows the truth STOP 
START poets moreover UNK on human passions STOP 
START and with this point about the passions we encounter plato's UNK STOP 
START the same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both UNK and more that we must examine it in some detail STOP 
START plato feels that man has two competing aspects his rational faculty and his UNK STOP 
START we can be UNK only if we control our lower UNK the passions in this case and strengthen our rational side poetry with all its emphasis on the passions UNK the audience to give way to emotion STOP 
START for this reason then poetry tends to UNK the power of control the reason because it UNK one to UNK his passions and even the best of men he maintains may be UNK by this subtle influence STOP 
START plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something of an UNK because he is so completely sensitive to its charm STOP 
START his whole objection indeed seems to rise out of a deep conviction that the poets do have great power to influence but plato seldom pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself STOP 
START he is rather concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets to join his fight for justice STOP 
START he wants them to use their great power to strengthen man's rational side to teach virtue and to encourage religion STOP 
START while plato finally allows a few acceptable UNK to the gods and famous men still he clearly leaves the way open for further discussion of the issue STOP 
START he even calls upon the poets to defend the UNK and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue STOP 
START he says we may further grant to those of her UNK UNK who are UNK of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a UNK spirit if this can be proved we shall surely be the UNK i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight STOP 
START when we turn to UNK ideas on the moral measure of literature it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned about the influence of the art STOP 
START in the ideal state for instance he UNK that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully selected tales and stories STOP 
START for this reason he would UNK UNK pictures and speeches from the stage the young people should not even be permitted to see UNK till they are old enough to drink strong wine and sit at the public tables STOP 
START by the time they reach that age however aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence of UNK STOP 
START in UNK analysis of tragedy in the UNK we find an attempt to UNK the art to consider only those things proper to it to discover how it UNK from other arts and to deal with the effects peculiar to it STOP 
START he UNK us early in the UNK that all art is imitation and that all imitation gives pleasure but he UNK between art in general and poetic art on the basis of the means manner and the objects of the imitation STOP 
START once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms he UNK down his famous definition of tragedy which sets up standards and so UNK direction to the remainder of the work STOP 
START a tragedy by his definition is an imitation of an action that is serious of a certain magnitude and complete in itself STOP 
START it should have a dramatic form with UNK language and it should UNK incidents which so UNK pity and fear that it UNK these emotions in the audience STOP 
START any tragedy he maintains has six elements plot character and thought the objects of imitation UNK and melody the means of imitation and spectacle the manner of imitation STOP 
START throughout the rest of the UNK aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics of these six parts and their UNK and he refers frequently to the standards suggested by his definition of tragedy STOP 
START UNK method in the UNK then does suggest that we should UNK the work STOP 
START the chicago UNK of modern critics follow aristotle so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation STOP 
START but there are however several features of UNK approach which open the way for the moral measure of literature STOP 
START for one thing aristotle UNK that plays may UNK the audience STOP 
START in addition his definition of a tragedy UNK our attention because a serious and important action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author or of the characters STOP 
START and there is one other point in the UNK that UNK moral evaluation UNK notion that the distinctive function of tragedy is to UNK one's emotions by UNK pity and fear STOP 
START he rejects certain UNK because they do not contribute to that end STOP 
START the point is that an ethical critic with an assist from UNK can UNK on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with a UNK UNK for our hostile UNK STOP 
START in his study samuel johnson joseph wood UNK takes this line when he says that what aristotle really means by his theory of UNK is that our evil passions may be so UNK by the dramatic ritual that it is less likely that we shall UNK them through our own acts STOP 
START in UNK view this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without UNK the explicit methods of a UNK STOP 
START and we can add that UNK interpretation of UNK is also one answer to plato's fear that poetry will encourage our passions STOP 
START if UNK is correct tragedy may have quite the opposite effect STOP 
START it may UNK our passions and so UNK the rule of reason STOP 
START or in more UNK terms the experience may serve to UNK our destructive UNK and strengthen the ego and UNK STOP 
START UNK and UNK the second half of the sixteenth century in england was the setting for a violent and long controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature especially the drama STOP 
START no one suggested that the ethical effects of the art were irrelevant STOP 
START both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral test but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or a bad influence STOP 
START both sides claimed that plato and aristotle supported their cause STOP 
START those who wanted to close the theaters for example pointed to plato's republic and those who wished to keep them open called on the plato of the UNK to UNK in their behalf STOP 
START the most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps sir philip UNK an UNK for UNK published in UNK STOP 
START many students of literature know that classical defense STOP 
START what is not so well known however and what is quite important for understanding the issues of this early quarrel is the kind of attack on literature that UNK was answering STOP 
START for this reason then i want to describe first two examples of the UNK attacks stephen UNK the school of abuse UNK and his later UNK UNK published in UNK STOP 
START second we will see how UNK answered the charges for while UNK essay was not specifically a reply to UNK his arguments do support the new theater STOP 
START according to william UNK study stephen UNK the theater business in london had become a UNK enterprise by UNK and in the opinion of many a thoroughly bad business STOP 
START aroused by what they considered an evil influence some members of the clergy joined by city authorities merchants and master UNK began the attack on the plays and the actors for what they called the UNK of the art but by UNK some of them began to UNK the whole idea of acting STOP 
START although this kind of UNK objection came at first from some men who were not UNK UNK still once the UNK gained power they UNK the affair by passing the UNK UNK of UNK which UNK that all public UNK shall cease and be UNK STOP 
START with that act of parliament the opponents of the stage won the day and for more than two decades after that england had no legitimate public drama STOP 
START in the early days of this controversy over the theater one of the interested parties stephen UNK published a little tract in which he objected UNK to the UNK of art rather than the art itself STOP 
START but his opposition hardened and by UNK in the school of abuse he was ready to UNK all players STOP 
START he UNK women to UNK of those places which in UNK UNK you and UNK you in UNK STOP 
START he does not really approve of UNK and laughter but sex is the deadly sin STOP 
START he UNK that a single glance can lead us into temptation for looking UNK have UNK UNK and UNK UNK may UNK in UNK STOP

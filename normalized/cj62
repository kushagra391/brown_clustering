START those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me STOP 
START it may well be that when UNK UNK and i visited your country last spring you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked STOP 
START as american artists it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as possible STOP 
START this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful STOP 
START even though we did not see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune to encounter that we had been in your midst STOP 
START i am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the UNK STOP 
START i can well understand your curiosity STOP 
START we ourselves are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live STOP 
START it is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the union of soviet artists STOP 
START there should be no reason to UNK or ignore the intent of this letter STOP 
START UNK and i UNK earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily UNK STOP 
START the UNK of little more than a month cannot UNK me to pose as an expert on anything i saw STOP 
START too much damage is done by experts who have spent even less time if any at all in the UNK STOP 
START nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific UNK interests STOP 
START if this attitude is seriously questioned in the soviet union it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view STOP 
START it is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own UNK are too UNK to UNK any symbolic significance to the UNK of a minority such as artists in any social order STOP 
START i encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union about my reactions to that experience STOP 
START that which i found most profound and most disturbing appeared to UNK a curiously UNK reaction STOP 
START almost as if i were talking about something quite UNK STOP 
START apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen UNK or at least UNK to individual impressions of a subject which UNK a good deal of their waking moments STOP 
START personal UNK tend to UNK the ear and in turn the voice as well STOP 
START i cannot be content with the UNK small talk of a somewhat unusual UNK STOP 
START i am equally UNK with the UNK of the shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long aggressive UNK of those who are UNK lost in a UNK jungle of the word revolution UNK UNK by the sick UNK of ignorance who try to build a UNK wall of UNK on our physical UNK STOP 
START difficult as it may have been at times UNK and i saw enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear STOP 
START artists and poets are the raw UNK of humanity are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life STOP 
START by themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would be very little left worth saving STOP 
START it cannot be said that our very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one STOP 
START on that cold but bright april day we were guests of your government in the UNK stand of red square to witness the UNK celebration for UNK UNK and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive UNK of the kremlin STOP 
START if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people UNK a new hero and a great national achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence STOP 
START we stood under a UNK tree in the rolling country just outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor STOP 
START the grave about UNK between his home and the blue UNK of a small church rose above the forms and spaces of gently UNK UNK of green the sounds of birds the silence of other UNK and the casual paths through small forests STOP 
START just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his ability of UNK his ideas and his craft more UNK STOP 
START but today we were aware of only two men STOP 
START one had taken a flight into UNK space in the service of science to return as a living hero STOP 
START the other had assumed the right to explore the equally UNK space of the human spirit STOP 
START the flowers on his grave UNK to the fact that he as well was UNK hero STOP 
START these two UNK form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which to me at least UNK the UNK in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between UNK and UNK STOP 
START a struggle that is being UNK all over the world in the UNK of UNK STOP 
START the UNK opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was UNK even further with an incredible UNK UNK STOP 
START the socialist environment it was stated had UNK these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit STOP 
START when i UNK on one such occasion that the new growth like other UNK might be unable to UNK i was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice STOP 
START i could not bring myself to answer that some of my best friends are UNK UNK STOP 
START this kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to STOP 
START after a while we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and UNK UNK STOP 
START a chance remark about UNK sealed train brought the UNK that this was a myth UNK to george UNK UNK tree STOP 
START theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific UNK concerning the UNK of UNK masses STOP 
START no wonder that UNK and i had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural exchange STOP 
START typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union of soviet artists STOP 
START we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of UNK artists STOP 
START instead we became involved in a series of friendly but UNK formal UNK addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind STOP 
START the terms of friendship understanding cooperation etc. tend to become somewhat UNK because of constant and UNK use STOP 
START i can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion STOP 
START the UNK female UNK of massive proportions and UNK appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of UNK gentlemen representing the arts STOP 
START it was only after we had responded with what i fear were similar UNK that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and UNK actions by the u.s. government in cuba and laos STOP 
START she UNK by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there STOP 
START unfortunately she returned later just as i had taken advantage of the UNK atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange program would be the UNK of abstract art in russia with social realism UNK dominance in the u.s. STOP 
START this gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the UNK UNK that we should not UNK to lecture her on abstraction STOP 
START she did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that abstraction as well as UNK were a russian invention that had been UNK as UNK by the people of the UNK STOP 
START UNK and i could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere STOP 
START we were to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with us the impression that in contrast to other soviet regions UNK atmosphere is UNK UNK and official STOP 
START to have one's intentions deliberately or UNK UNK is always a waste of time STOP 
START until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or UNK STOP 
START artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion furthermore i could not UNK the UNK that i spoke for american artists as a group STOP 
START to save time some UNK seemed necessary STOP 
START the following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in UNK we have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and UNK your ideas and your ways STOP 
START our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all people STOP 
START we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and UNK of ideas between individuals STOP 
START in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit STOP 
START we are UNK aware that yours is a society which in spite of several wars and many UNK has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world STOP 
START your past history is UNK with the fruits of the UNK STOP 
START your present history is equally UNK for its industrial and scientific achievements STOP 
START we have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to UNK you with that of ours STOP 
START while we as american artists believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole STOP 
START in stating this position we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect STOP 
START as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not UNK to speak for all other american artists STOP 
START but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for UNK between you and us but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding STOP 
START like UNK we have pride and love for our country STOP 
START to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from UNK terror in order to live in UNK freedom STOP 
START as artists we feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation STOP

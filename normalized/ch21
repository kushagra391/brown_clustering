START strategy and tactics of the u.s. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest UNK in history STOP 
START the change of emphasis from UNK to UNK warfare must be made with care UNK that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other STOP 
START our military forces must be capable of UNK successfully with any UNK which may be forced upon us from limited UNK to UNK nuclear general war STOP 
START forces and military personnel strength STOP 
START -hl-- this budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level a UNK strength of UNK men and women in the active forces STOP 
START the forces to be supported include an army of 14 divisions and UNK men navy of UNK active ships and UNK men marine corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with UNK men an air force of UNK combat wings and UNK men STOP 
START if the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war their basic organization and objectives must UNK to the changing character and missions of the active forces STOP 
START quality and combat readiness must take UNK over mere numbers STOP 
START under modern conditions this is especially true of the ready reserve STOP 
START i have requested the secretary of defense to UNK the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare STOP 
START last year the congress UNK its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the army reserve STOP 
START similar restrictions on the strength of the army national guard contained in the 1960 department of defense UNK act should likewise be dropped STOP 
START i strongly recommend to the congress the UNK of UNK floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity STOP 
START i again proposed a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve from their present UNK of UNK and UNK respectively to UNK and UNK by the end of the fiscal year 1961 STOP 
START these UNK are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the UNK in support of our national security objectives STOP 
START military personnel costs STOP 
START -hl-- about UNK of the expenditures for the department of defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs including pay for active reserve and retired military personnel STOP 
START these expenditures are estimated to be UNK billion an increase of UNK million over 1960 reflecting additional UNK pay of career personnel more UNK an increased number of men drawing UNK pay and social security tax increases effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 STOP 
START retired pay costs are increased by UNK million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel STOP 
START these increased costs are partially UNK by a decrease of UNK million in expenditures for the reserve forces largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the army reserve components during 1961 STOP 
START UNK rates of pay for retired military personnel have been UNK to current rates of pay for active personnel STOP 
START the 1958 military pay act UNK from this established formula by providing for a UNK increase rather than a UNK increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of june 1 1958 STOP 
START i UNK pending legislation that will UNK the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates STOP 
START operation and maintenance STOP 
START -hl-- expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the armed forces are estimated to be UNK billion in 1961 which is UNK million more than in 1960 STOP 
START the increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment STOP 
START a substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential STOP 
START also the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures STOP 
START further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the congress last year STOP 
START other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour up UNK in two years and of each UNK hour up UNK STOP 
START in total these increases in operating costs UNK the savings that result from UNK programs and from economy measures such as reduced numbers of units and installations smaller inventories of major equipment and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the armed forces STOP 
START in the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 i recommended immediate UNK of section UNK of the act of september 28 1951 65 UNK UNK STOP 
START this section UNK the military departments and the office of civil and defense UNK from carrying out certain UNK involving real property unless they come into agreement with the committees on armed services of the senate and the house of representatives STOP 
START as i have stated previously the attorney general has advised me that this section UNK fundamental constitutional principles STOP 
START accordingly if it is not UNK by the congress at its present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to UNK the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise STOP 
START basic UNK communications in alaska are now provided through federal facilities operated by the army air force and federal UNK agency STOP 
START the growing communications needs of this new state can best be met as they have in other states through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise STOP 
START legislation has already been proposed to UNK the sale of these UNK systems in alaska and its early UNK is desirable STOP 
START procurement research and construction STOP 
START -hl-- approximately UNK of the expenditures for the department of defense are for procurement research development and construction programs STOP 
START in 1961 these expenditures are estimated at UNK billion compared to UNK billion in 1960 STOP 
START the UNK which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement are UNK in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks vehicles guns and electronic devices STOP 
START expenditures for UNK are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 STOP 
START new UNK authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement excluding amounts for related research and construction UNK UNK million which is UNK million below that enacted for 1960 STOP 
START on the other hand the new authority of UNK million proposed for missile procurement excluding research and construction in 1961 is UNK million higher than for 1960 STOP 
START these contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our armed forces in the years ahead STOP 
START the department of defense UNK acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive UNK by firms in other countries on certain military supply items STOP 
START as i have repeatedly stated this provision is much more UNK than the general law UNK known as the buy american act STOP 
START i urge once again that the congress not UNK this rider STOP 
START the task of providing a reasonable level of military strength without UNK other vital aspects of our security is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress STOP 
START the last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history STOP 
START some weapons systems have become UNK while still in production and some while still under development STOP 
START furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological UNK on any one weapon system in itself often UNK the relative importance of other competitive systems STOP 
START this has necessitated a continuous review and UNK of the defense program in order to UNK resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been UNK by events STOP 
START thus in the last few years a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was UNK have since been completely eliminated STOP 
START for example the importance of the UNK 2 a very promising UNK UNK missile designed to be launched by UNK submarines was greatly UNK by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced UNK ballistic missile launched by UNK submarines STOP 
START another example is the recent UNK of the UNK a long-range UNK with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the UNK STOP 
START the substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles STOP 
START considering the high cost of the UNK system over UNK billion for the force that had been planned and the time period in which it would become operational it was decided to stop further work on the project STOP 
START meanwhile other air defense forces are being made effective as described later in this message STOP 
START the size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans STOP 
START notable in this category are the UNK and UNK intermediate range ballistic missiles which have been successfully developed produced and UNK but the relative importance of which has UNK with the increasing availability of the atlas UNK ballistic missile STOP 
START the impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the UNK fuel program STOP 
START this project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a UNK fuel to provide an extra UNK of range for high performance aircraft particularly our heavy bombers STOP 
START continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means have now raised serious questions about the value of the UNK fuel program STOP 
START as a result the scope of this project has been sharply UNK STOP 
START these examples UNK the importance of even more searching UNK of new major development programs and even more penetrating and UNK analyses of the UNK of future technology STOP 
START the cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development in determining the most satisfactory rate of development and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it STOP 
START strategic forces STOP 
START -hl-- the UNK power of our armed forces comes from both their nuclear UNK capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war STOP 
START the first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers UNK aircraft and UNK and intermediate range missiles STOP 
START the second capability is represented by our UNK ground naval and air forces in essential forward areas together with ready UNK capable of UNK early emergency UNK STOP 
START the strategic air command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability STOP 
START one of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the UNK a long-range UNK UNK STOP 
START this aircraft which was planned for initial operational use about UNK would be UNK to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems all of which are scheduled to become available earlier STOP 
START the first atlas UNK are now operational the first two UNK submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year and the first UNK UNK next year STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK is planned to be operational about UNK STOP 
START by UNK several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their UNK established STOP 
START thus the need for the UNK as a strategic weapon system is doubtful STOP 
START however i am UNK that development work on the UNK UNK and engines be continued STOP 
START it is expected that in UNK two UNK aircraft will be available for flight testing STOP 
START by that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system STOP 
START i am UNK additional UNK of the improved version of the UNK the UNK with the new UNK engine and procurement of the UNK UNK medium UNK together with the supporting UNK UNK in each case STOP 
START these additional modern bombers will replace some of the older UNK medium bombers UNK can do the work of several UNK which it will replace STOP 
START funds are also included in this budget to continue the UNK of the UNK wings with the UNK dog UNK missile STOP 
START in the coming fiscal year additional quantities of atlas UNK and UNK missiles also will be UNK STOP

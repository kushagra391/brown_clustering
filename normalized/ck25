START he was in his UNK at this time long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be UNK yet once again and it was almost a decade since he had UNK off UNK STOP 
START there was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received was always the same UNK success now STOP 
START he could no longer build anything whether a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in UNK without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same UNK technique they were such UNK and sometimes even UNK buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality of authentic UNK about them which once established by an artist as his private vision is no longer UNK as to its other values STOP 
START UNK UNK was UNK famous a UNK of a genuine UNK in foreign eyes an original designer whose UNK UNK with steel and concrete was made even more UNK sincere by his personality STOP 
START he had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone UNK with the same wife a remarkably childish thing in itself rose at UNK six every morning made himself some french coffee had his corn UNK and more coffee UNK four cigarettes while reading last UNK herald tribune and UNK pittsburgh UNK then put on his UNK UNK shoes and walked under a UNK UNK to his workshop STOP 
START this was an UNK long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil UNK STOP 
START the UNK of his other careers was piled everywhere pile of wire UNK for UNK from his time as a UNK and a UNK lying on its side on the window UNK vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with UNK steel UNK UNK out into the air UNK UNK on the floor from the time he was UNK his disastrous UNK whose smoke would pass through a whole house visible all the way up through wire UNK on each floor STOP 
START his files desk UNK board and a high UNK formed the only clean island in the chaos STOP 
START everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form his models drawings UNK UNK in UNK from his painting days and UNK a UNK of UNK books that looked as though their UNK had been UNK by a UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK he had once used as the basis of the design for the UNK UNK company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of UNK UNK which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house STOP 
START he worked standing with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment UNK with the surprised stare of one who was watching another UNK hand STOP 
START sometimes he would UNK softly to some UNK UNK beside him sometimes he would look stern and UNK as his pencil did what he UNK STOP 
START it all seemed if one could have UNK in at him through one of his windows as though this UNK man with the muscular arms and UNK neck was merely the UNK trying his hand at the UNK work STOP 
START this air of UNK carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things and people often UNK it for boredom in him or a surrender to UNK routine STOP 
START but he was not bored at all had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he should alter it STOP 
START there are after all fortunate souls who hear everything but only know how to listen to what is good for them and UNK was as things go a fortunate man STOP 
START he left his home the day after new year's wearing a UNK and UNK UNK and without a hat STOP 
START he would wear this same UNK in florida despite his wife UNK UNK over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him STOP 
START but he was too busy to hear what she was saying STOP 
START so they UNK when she was in an UNK humor STOP 
START when he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his UNK UNK for the UNK key which he had dropped a moment before she came out of the house with an enormous UNK UNK over her head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad and handed him a clean UNK through the window STOP 
START finding the key under his shoe he started the engine and while it UNK up he turned to her standing there in the UNK fog and said UNK the refrigerator STOP 
START he saw the surprise in her face and laughed as though it were the UNK expression he had ever seen STOP 
START he kept on laughing until she started laughing with him STOP 
START he had a deep voice which was full of good food she had UNK and good humor explosive laugh which always carried everything before it STOP 
START he would settle himself into his seat to laugh STOP 
START whenever he laughed it was all he was doing STOP 
START and she was made to fall in love with him again there in the UNK dirt driveway standing in the cold fog mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by STOP 
START she was UNK at this time a UNK woman of UNK with an UNK narrow face which had the distinction of a UNK or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer STOP 
START her UNK were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders STOP 
START there was an air of blindness in her gray eyes the UNK look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an UNK line long since UNK from UNK and which besides has kept its estate intact STOP 
START she was personally UNK and when she had UNK would blow her nose in the same UNK all day and keep it UNK wet UNK from her waist and when she UNK she would eat dinner with dirt on her UNK STOP 
START but just when she seemed to have UNK into some UNK of UNK she would disappear and come down UNK brushed and taking UNK of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a UNK UNK a grace of history so to speak and for an instant one saw how UNK proud she was and UNK on certain questions of personal value STOP 
START she even spoke differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp STOP 
START now drive carefully for god's sake called trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure STOP 
START but he did not notice and was already UNK the car down to the road saying UNK the UNK of a tree as he passed it the same UNK which had UNK the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed STOP 
START she stood UNK her UNK around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road STOP 
START then when he had it pointed down the hill he stopped to gaze at her through the window STOP 
START she had begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell STOP 
START he looked at her out of himself she thought as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised her even now when his UNK hair was UNK a little and his breath came hard through his UNK lungs the look of the UNK youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the UNK gallery on a thursday once STOP 
START now she kept herself UNK ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said UNK more and roared off into the fog his foot evidently surprising him with the UNK with which it pressed the UNK just as his hand did when he worked STOP 
START she walked back to the house and entered feeling herself returning UNK some kind of opportunity in the empty building STOP 
START there is a death in all UNK she knew and promptly put it out of her mind STOP 
START she enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially alone in her house was the UNK part of life STOP 
START now she could let out the three UNK without fear they would be stepped on or that UNK would let them out one of the doors could dust the plants then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on UNK on the UNK finally the best part of all simply sit at the UNK table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers reading the UNK as well as the news UNK nothing on her mind but letting her soul UNK itself above all UNK and desire STOP 
START she did this now comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon it was getting to be STOP 
START she fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the house UNK as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years hearing the birds UNK in their UNK and the occasional UNK of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to UNK in the UNK of her arm STOP 
START every few minutes she would UNK for a moment to review things UNK yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and nothing was burning on the stove and UNK was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers STOP 
START then she fell asleep again as UNK as a person with fever and when she UNK it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes STOP 
START she stood up UNK her hair down UNK her clothes feeling a UNK for the UNK darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of the need to answer to respond to be aware even of UNK coming in or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she UNK a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her head UNK and in a moment she found it hard to wait for UNK to come with her guests STOP 
START she went into the living room and turned on three UNK then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the UNK on the barn UNK the driveway STOP 
START she knew she was feeling afraid and UNK laughed at herself STOP 
START they were both so young after all so UNK for any final UNK STOP 
START how could it have been thirty years already she wondered yes nineteen plus thirty was UNK and she was UNK and she had been married at nineteen STOP 
START she stood still over the leg of UNK rubbing UNK into it quite suddenly conscious of a UNK in her stomach and a feeling of UNK a sensation of violence that started her shivering STOP

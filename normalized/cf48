START the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch UNK not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following UNK between attorney general UNK and the heads of certain national chain stores should of course be UNK STOP 
START but for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a UNK throughout the nation would require the UNK of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case STOP 
START the UNK in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic UNK of stores located in new york and general company policy STOP 
START then the UNK would not be secondary but a primary one STOP 
START it would be directed against the actual location of the UNK policy which for UNK sake and for the sake of justice must be removed and UNK from this to the economic injury of the people directly and UNK a part of this policy STOP 
START perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic UNK of an entire national chain in order by threatening potential injury to its entire economy to effect an UNK of the policy of its local stores in the matter of UNK STOP 
START such a general UNK might still be a UNK or UNK instrument and therefore of UNK justification STOP 
START action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate STOP 
START moreover UNK alone would indicate that unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which UNK to these customs leading to greater UNK and local autonomy within the company or even as the final UNK of an UNK application of economic pressure to correct injustice to its going out of business in certain sections of the country as for that matter the UNK who once had many meetings in the UNK war south largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue never to recover a large number of southern UNK STOP 
START in any case anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic UNK as a means which broke out a few years ago or was UNK organized by white UNK UNK in the entire state of mississippi against every local UNK dealer in that state in protest against a UNK program over a national tv network on which was presented a drama showing it seemed a high yellow UNK UNK with a white man STOP 
START it is true of course that the end or objective of this action was different STOP 
START but since this is a world in which people UNK about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice and since in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force STOP 
START the need that we not give UNK approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual UNK of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that white UNK UNK seem resolved to maintain UNK mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence STOP 
START an unlimited use of economic pressures for UNK opposite causes could UNK the UNK of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously UNK means STOP 
START the end or aim of the action of course is also important especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to UNK a person from UNK forward to claim his legal rights e.g. against negroes who register to vote in UNK county tennessee at the present moment STOP 
START here the UNK is in steps to give economic UNK to those being UNK and to legal UNK STOP 
START this however is sufficient to show that more or less UNK resistance and economic conflict if both sides are strong enough can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used STOP 
START it is also sufficient to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just i.e. that if economic pressure has to be UNK to this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some UNK change in business or UNK practices while if injury fall upon others it fall upon them indirectly and UNK however inevitably and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them STOP 
START it is clear that UNK resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and UNK in christian morality like any other form of resistance STOP 
START the language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory perhaps to be chosen above all others STOP 
START one of the UNK leaders has said nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell can stop the march to freedom STOP 
START everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them STOP 
START the present writer certainly agrees with that statement and would also affirm this in the order of justice STOP 
START however it is also a christian insight to know that unless UNK UNK justice it is not likely to be freedom that UNK forward STOP 
START and when UNK UNK man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply UNK this with a sentimental good will STOP 
START it also definitely UNK conduct in the way explained above and this means far more than in the choice of UNK means STOP 
START r. b. UNK has written that UNK and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the UNK of physical UNK to cause the UNK to lose his moral balance STOP 
START he suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him again that the object of UNK resistance is partly UNK to this object of war namely to UNK the opponent to break his will to destroy his confidence enthusiasm and hope STOP 
START in another respect it is UNK for UNK resistance UNK the opponent only to UNK in him a new morale that is UNK because it is based on UNK values STOP 
START a trial of strength however is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone UNK in UNK resistance will be convinced that his action is based on UNK values than those of his opponent in warfare with any means men commonly UNK over the justice of the cause STOP 
START this makes necessary a morality of means and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified STOP 
START the question then is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even UNK means of UNK is to be found in the fact that such conduct UNK and UNK the opponent while UNK and UNK him STOP 
START here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives to them it will seem UNK that it is proposed to defeat such causes UNK STOP 
START a technique by which it is proposed to enter with UNK into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited UNK STOP 
START among christian groups the UNK have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine UNK raises UNK the question of the christian use of all forms of pressure STOP 
START since the will and word of god are for them concentrated in UNK love it seems clear to them that UNK resistance is quite another thing STOP 
START the primary objective of UNK writes the outstanding UNK UNK is not peace or UNK to the divine will but rather certain desired social changes for personal or class or national advantage STOP 
START without UNK with every phrase in this statement we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance and then go on beyond the UNK position and affirm that christian UNK must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance STOP 
START these principles we have now set forth STOP 
START economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted but clearly specified when this is done it will be found that the principles governing christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and UNK means and apply to both alike UNK either on occasion and always limiting either action STOP 
START economy in the use of power means more than UNK a barely UNK pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed STOP 
START that would amount to UNK the means and UNK them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals STOP 
START there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance violent or UNK STOP 
START the justification in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also UNK down its UNK in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall and those who may never be directly UNK for the sake even of achieving some great good STOP 
START in these terms the economic UNK of the negroes of UNK tennessee from trading in the center city for example was clearly justified since these distinctions do not require that only people UNK guilty be UNK out STOP 
START we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action UNK economic pressure or else action that would seem to UNK the principles set forth above STOP 
START there may be instances in which if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people STOP 
START an excellent article was published recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african UNK on the UNK economic conditions of the UNK in south africa UNK to UNK slavery and the economic UNK of both the government and the people of the united states in these conditions STOP 
START UNK of american dollars not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of u.s. taxpayers this author states are being poured into south africa to support a system dedicated to the UNK the UNK and the almost UNK UNK of 12 million people the color of whose UNK happens not to be white STOP 
START both the conditions and the UNK are UNK in considerable detail STOP 
START this leads to the conclusion that the fact is UNK that america does have a say in whether or not UNK shall continue STOP 
START our leadership in a wide economic UNK of south africa would be not only in UNK it seems with the moral conscience of america not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country but also in UNK with our law u.s. code title 19 section UNK which UNK the UNK of goods made by forced or UNK labor STOP 
START not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which this author believes must surely be supported by every american who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can UNK and UNK contribute to the UNK of another nation STOP

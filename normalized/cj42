START in the century from UNK to UNK the law of nations became international law STOP 
START several factors contributed to this change STOP 
START the congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it both UNK and symbolized what was to follow STOP 
START here in UNK the great nations assembled to UNK not merely for europe but for the world STOP 
START thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century STOP 
START international law had to fit the conditions of europe and nothing that could not fit this system or the interests of the great european nations UNK could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense STOP 
START essentially this imposed two conditions first international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive suspicious and UNK in their political UNK with one another it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared STOP 
START in both respects international law was UNK STOP 
START it was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions STOP 
START on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain UNK each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality thus UNK for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the flexibility of UNK that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous UNK experience STOP 
START but there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world STOP 
START thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere STOP 
START political interference in africa and asia and even in latin america though limited in latin america by the special interest of the united states as expressed in the monroe doctrine itself from the outset related to european politics and long dependent upon the balance of power system in europe was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the european balance itself STOP 
START a nation such as switzerland could be UNK by agreement and could be UNK upon to protect its UNK doubtful but possible with an assist from the north was the UNK of the latin american countries of the question was the UNK of asia and africa STOP 
START this UNK of the law was made explicit by a number of UNK century scholars STOP 
START more emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of civilized nations and story the great early american scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase or of christian nations which is a substantial equivalent STOP 
START UNK stated that the public law was essentially limited to the civilized and christian peoples of europe or to those of european origin STOP 
START of course it had always been of european origin in fact but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory STOP 
START now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules thus established by the advanced UNK of europe were to be imposed on others STOP 
START the european customs on which international law was based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states STOP 
START hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of UNK countries STOP 
START they must do something with the UNK of the latter or some of them which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its UNK beyond all possibility of UNK STOP 
START during the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the latin american writers though UNK just as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect today STOP 
START a number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the UNK of the law of nations into international law is from aspects of a universal system of justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states STOP 
START the difference is important for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among UNK this was by no means its exclusive UNK STOP 
START the law of nature governed UNK in their relationship to their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a UNK unified system STOP 
START the theory of international law which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america broke this unity and this UNK STOP 
START it lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially UNK with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations STOP 
START no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action STOP 
START to appreciate this development we must UNK it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy STOP 
START first and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state and the individual's identification with the state as UNK other ties of social solidarity STOP 
START national identification was not new but it was UNK in intensity and scope throughout europe as new UNK occurred STOP 
START it reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of state will put forward by the germans especially by UNK although political UNK will recognize its UNK in the rejected UNK of UNK STOP 
START national identification was reflected UNK in law theories which incorporated this UNK abstraction and saw law domestic and international simply as its formal reflection STOP 
START in the international community this reduced law to UNK UNK STOP 
START a state the highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected to law only by a UNK of UNK or consent STOP 
START according to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical UNK STOP 
START he no longer sought to find the law made it could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be STOP 
START there was no law domestic or international except that UNK by acknowledged by or UNK to by states STOP 
START hidden behind UNK UNK were more practical reasons for a changing UNK STOP 
START related to but UNK from nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another STOP 
START increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions STOP 
START the efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of UNK led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through UNK institutions STOP 
START law became a conscious process something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms STOP 
START particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were UNK STOP 
START the old way of doing things which UNK on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer adequate to the task STOP 
START first was the period of UNK of existing law the code UNK in france and the peculiar UNK that in fact resulted from UNK UNK and ordering of the common law in england STOP 
START UNK was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting the older law much dealing with entirely new situations STOP 
START the legislative mills have been UNK ever since and when its UNK processes were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority was UNK in one form or another to the executive STOP 
START whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law STOP 
START indeed with developed UNK the separation of law from justice or from morality generally became quite specific STOP 
START in municipal systems we tend to view what is called UNK as UNK a movement to UNK policy by increasing the power of parliament the elected representatives at the expense of the more conservative UNK STOP 
START when the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit when norms were UNK and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in UNK hands two purposes were served government was made UNK to an UNK popular will and law became a rational system for UNK that will for serving conscious goals for UNK the public policy STOP 
START it is true that initially the task was to remove restrictions that it was thought UNK the free flow of money goods and labor even UNK was a conscious policy STOP 
START law was seen as an UNK of the sovereign will STOP 
START however the sovereign was not UNK absolute UNK but rather the UNK sovereign of austin STOP 
START it was too an optimistic philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means an UNK or UNK one STOP 
START man through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny STOP 
START the theory did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a UNK UNK STOP 
START it was merely a UNK and ordering of new institutions of popular government STOP 
START it was not opposed to either justice or morality merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who UNK public authority STOP 
START particularly was this true as UNK capitalism became the dominant UNK of western society STOP 
START to free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising UNK and this objective required that governmental authority administrative officials and judges be limited as precisely and UNK as possible old customs which UNK trade be UNK business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might UNK the automatic adjustments of the free market obligations of status that were UNK with the new politics and the new economics be done away with STOP 
START contract conceived as the free UNK of formal UNK replaced the implied obligations of a more static and UNK society STOP 
START indeed contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the UNK of the free society STOP 
START government itself was based upon contract organization the corporation was analyzed in UNK terms was based on freedom of contract and money was UNK and borrowed on UNK terms marriage and the family was seen as a UNK arrangement STOP 
START it is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract STOP 
START in fact some UNK is the principle example went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the displacement at least to a considerable extent of the ethical UNK of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by UNK UNK both international law theory and doctrine STOP 
START in the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law UNK the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system STOP 
START one result was to UNK much that had been regarded as the law of nations STOP 
START UNK law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all UNK from the older law of nations and made dependent on the several national laws STOP 
START private international law which americans call the conflict of laws was thus segregated from international law proper or as it is often called public international law STOP 
START states were free to UNK within broad though perhaps UNK limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts to vary the law merchant and to UNK legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high UNK STOP 
START the change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be UNK by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation and then largely in marginal situations STOP

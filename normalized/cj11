START many other probably nearly all snakes at maturity are already more than half their final length STOP 
START UNK m. UNK put length at maturity at two UNK the ultimate length for some UNK and charles c. UNK data on michigan UNK and ribbon snakes UNK show that the smallest UNK females are more than half as long as the biggest adults STOP 
START felix UNK states that when the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its UNK length but goes on to UNK the UNK python as an exception with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity STOP 
START it is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow UNK after UNK maturity was working with species of UNK so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect STOP 
START certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity but it is impossible to know whether this is due to UNK conditions STOP 
START additional records of slow growth have been omitted STOP 
START it is possible to make a few UNK about the six giants themselves STOP 
START there seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths starting with the smallest UNK UNK and ending with the largest anaconda STOP 
START data on the former are UNK but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others thereby UNK support to the belief that the anaconda does indeed attain the greatest length STOP 
START for four of the six the anaconda and the UNK python cannot be included for lack of data there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length the UNK UNK being the smallest and the indian python the next in size at the former stage STOP 
START let us UNK a little on the maximum size of the anaconda STOP 
START if in a certain part of the range it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other relatively large giants and reaches maturity at let us guess 18 inches longer than the others a UNK of the maturity length would result in a maximum of nearly 40 feet STOP 
START when it comes to rate of early growth the indian python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years more or less STOP 
START the african rock python a close second is followed in turn by the UNK python STOP 
START there are few data on the UNK UNK those for the anaconda are UNK and there is nothing at all on the UNK python STOP 
START it seems likely that the indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently UNK UNK well to UNK and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep STOP 
START i cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet STOP 
START until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions it will be wise to UNK from drawing conclusions STOP 
START it is often stated that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity but this apparently is an UNK STOP 
START the best way to determine the correct figure in UNK is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth a method that produced surprising results UNK of a male indian python in less than two years his mate in less than three on the UNK UNK about match this STOP 
START another approach is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at maturity STOP 
START results from this approach UNK confirm the direct observations about three years are required there being a possible slight difference between males and females in the time required STOP 
START only the UNK python and the anaconda must be UNK for lack or UNK of data STOP 
START the following information on snakes varying greatly in size but all with less than a UNK maximum shows when considered with the foregoing that there is probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature STOP 
START UNK in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the united states could supply data on the UNK period for only three species in addition to the UNK which i shall consider separately STOP 
START these three were much alike lined snake UNK one year and nine months snake UNK two years UNK two years STOP 
START UNK investigated the UNK carefully himself and also UNK what others have found STOP 
START he concluded that in the southern species which are rapidly growing types females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they are three STOP 
START other UNK have UNK that in the northern united states the prairie UNK may not give first birth until it is four or even five years old and that the young may be born every other year rather than annually STOP 
START UNK study showed that female common UNK and ribbon snakes of michigan mature at about the age of two STOP 
START maximum length UNK UNK are never brought home either alive or preserved and field measurements are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to UNK dimensions STOP 
START measurements of UNK are of little value snake hide is UNK longer than its UNK and UNK stretching presents no difficulty to the UNK UNK STOP 
START in spite of all the UNK there is a certain amount of agreement on some of the giants STOP 
START the anaconda proves to be the fly in the UNK but the reason for this is not clear relatively wild conditions still found in tropical south america might be responsible STOP 
START there are three levels on which to treat the subject STOP 
START the first is the strictly scientific which demands concrete proof and therefore may UNK on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh STOP 
START this approach rejects virtually all field measurements STOP 
START the next level attempts to UNK varied evidence and come to a balanced sensible conclusion measurements by experienced UNK are not rejected and even reports of a less scientific nature are UNK evaluated STOP 
START the third level UNK on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire STOP 
START the argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about UNK snakes about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again or even of UNK that chase people out of UNK mere UNK up of testimony does not prove to the scientific mind the existence of UNK snakes joint snakes or UNK STOP 
START UNK has recently used the UNK approach with the largest snakes and has come to these conclusions the anaconda reaches a length of at least UNK feet the UNK python UNK the african rock python 25 the UNK python at least 22 the indian python 20 and the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK also treats of the largest snakes but on the third level and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda STOP 
START he reasons that as UNK 30 feet long are often found some might be 38 and occasional monstrous UNK over 50 STOP 
START he rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more STOP 
START his UNK chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge UNK with UNK strength but these seem to be given to complete his picture not to be believed STOP 
START detailed information on record lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows STOP 
START growth of the six giants discussions of the giants one by one will include as far as possible data on these aspects of growth size at which life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached required to reach maturity of growth both before and after this crucial stage maximum length with UNK or UNK of UNK figures STOP 
START definite information on the growth of UNK individuals is lacking STOP 
START anaconda at birth this species varies considerably in size STOP 
START a UNK of UNK born at UNK UNK near chicago ranged in length from 22 to UNK inches and averaged 29 inches STOP 
START lawrence e. UNK gives measurements of nineteen young UNK presumably members of a UNK from south america extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit of the UNK UNK and its average STOP 
START raymond l. UNK had two UNK that averaged 27 inches STOP 
START r. r. UNK and f. w. UNK give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a UNK of thirty from the region of the UNK UNK STOP 
START william UNK reports 26 inches and UNK UNK this snake must have been UNK for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british UNK STOP 
START in contrast UNK recorded the average length of UNK young of a UNK female as 38 inches and four young were born in london at a length of 35 or UNK inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 UNK STOP 
START UNK had a UNK anaconda that weighed only UNK UNK STOP 
START a difference between UNK might explain the great range in size STOP 
START i have little information on the UNK rate of growth STOP 
START hans UNK had one that increased from UNK inches to 5 feet 3 inches in five years and j. j. UNK records a growth of from less than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years STOP 
START it is very unlikely that either of these UNK was growing at a normal rate STOP 
START in 1948 UNK do UNK the noted UNK UNK wrote a technical paper on the giant snakes STOP 
START he concluded that the UNK maximum length is 12 or 13 perhaps 14 meters which would approximate from UNK to 42 feet 14 meters is slightly less than UNK feet STOP 
START thus his estimate lies between UNK suggestion of at least UNK feet and the UNK monstrous UNK UNK by UNK STOP 
START the most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in eastern UNK by UNK UNK a UNK UNK of the UNK oil company and reported in 1944 by UNK r. UNK STOP 
START however as a field measurement it is open to question STOP 
START UNK UNK feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable STOP 
START however many UNK remain UNK and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 feet STOP 
START it is possible that especially large UNK will prove to belong to UNK limited to a small area STOP 
START in snakes difference in size is a common characteristic of UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK a UNK UNK UNK of sixteen UNK UNK born in the UNK island UNK averaged 20 inches STOP 
START this birth length seems to be typical STOP 
START when some thirteen records of newly and recently born individuals are UNK little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected STOP 
START the range is from 14 to 25 inches former figure is based on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central american female see chapter on laying brooding UNK and birth the latter on a normal newly born individual STOP 
START however as so many of the records are not certainly based on UNK snakes these data must be taken UNK conclusions will have to UNK the measurements of UNK from definite UNK STOP 
START UNK r. UNK measurements of several very young specimens from UNK suggest that at birth the female is slightly larger than the male STOP 
START i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity STOP 
START carl UNK has written to me of sexual activity in february 1943 of young born in march 1940 STOP 
START one female collected on an island off the coast of UNK was UNK and measured 4 feet 8 inches from UNK to UNK her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long STOP 
START the female from central america which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long STOP 
START what data there are on growth indicate considerable variation in rate no one has kept complete records of one individual whereas many have been made for a very short period of time STOP 
START the results are too varied to allow UNK STOP

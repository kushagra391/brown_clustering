START workers of the party to the editor sir we are writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff of the public health nursing service of jersey city registered professional UNK with college background and varying experiences STOP 
START the day before election day to which we are entitled as a legal holiday we were informed to report to our respective UNK to work as workers of the party STOP 
START being ethical and professional people interested in community health and UNK we felt this wasn't a function of our position STOP 
START such tactics UNK of UNK we understand this UNK was given to all city and county employes STOP 
START to our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political UNK STOP 
START we therefore considered the suggestion an UNK to our intelligence ethics bill of rights etc. STOP 
START our only obligation for this day is to vote free of UNK for the person we feel is capable in UNK the public STOP 
START this is our duty not as UNK or city employes but as citizens of the united states STOP 
START UNK shelters to the editor sir i read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be UNK for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters STOP 
START does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free UNK UNK to help themselves but ready to demand that the community help and protect them shelters are of course necessary for those having no space for shelter STOP 
START if in a town of UNK private homes half of them have shelters the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent STOP 
START in UNK his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that UNK UNK UNK so he will be able to take in a stranger STOP 
START i hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart will get busy and be the first member of our UNK shelter club STOP 
START escape to the editor sir people continue to UNK the reason for the race for outer space STOP 
START it's simple enough from my point of view STOP 
START i am for it STOP 
START it is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's world STOP 
START supports katanga to the editor sir when the UNK decided upon freedom from england we insisted through the declaration of independence that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political UNK STOP 
START it is high time the united states began to realize that the UNK rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to katanga STOP 
START in the united nations charter the right of UNK is also an essential principle STOP 
START this again applies to katanga STOP 
START the people of katanga had fought for and obtained their freedom from the communist UNK of UNK UNK and his UNK STOP 
START by political economic UNK and natural standards they were justified in doing so STOP 
START the united states and the u.n. UNK their own principles when they defend the communist UNK and refuse to acknowledge the right of UNK of the UNK STOP 
START county college costs to the editor sir permit me to UNK your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax UNK and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to STOP 
START the bill which passed the assembly last may and is now pending in the senate should be given careful scrutiny STOP 
START the procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly UNK many taxpayers STOP 
START under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed will be elected STOP 
START the trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate STOP 
START this board will consist of two of the trustees of the college and the director and two members of the board of UNK STOP 
START it will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will UNK this amount to the board of UNK which shall appropriate in the same manner as other UNK are made by it the amount so UNK and the amount shall be UNK UNK and collected in the same manner as UNK appropriated for other purposes STOP 
START the approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to UNK the amount of money to be UNK to the college STOP 
START since two of these could be trustees of the college actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to UNK a UNK of millions of dollars of tax revenue STOP 
START this is taxation without representation STOP 
START UNK improvements to the editor sir your editorial housing UNK is certainly not the answer to our UNK problems STOP 
START the very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of UNK conditions STOP 
START change our UNK law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for UNK or improvements to his properties STOP 
START then see what a UNK in all UNK as well as UNK UNK at no cost to taxpayers will happen STOP 
START our entire economy will have a UNK UNK STOP 
START natural causes to the editor sir an old man is kicked to death by UNK STOP 
START the medical examiner states that death was due to natural causes STOP 
START i once heard a UNK say that if you are killed by a UNK in new york it is listed as death due to natural causes STOP 
START UNK exhibit to the editor sir every resident of this city should visit the UNK museum and see the exhibit our changing UNK in UNK STOP 
START it will be at the museum until march 30 STOP 
START it is a revelation of what has been done what is being done and what will be done in UNK as shown by UNK plans models and pictures STOP 
START it shows what a beautiful city UNK will become and certainly make every UNK proud of this city STOP 
START it should also make him desire to participate actively in civic school and religious life of the community so that that phase of UNK will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit STOP 
START UNK UNK to the editor sir i UNK to join in praise of the men in the toll UNK on the garden state UNK STOP 
START recently i traveled the UNK from east orange to cape may and i found the most UNK group of men you will find anywhere STOP 
START one even gave my little dog a UNK STOP 
START it was very UNK STOP 
START deep UNK show the UNK of the deep UNK show at 15th and m streets UNK have an added attraction the view of a UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START twenty feet below the street level in the UNK of the new motel to be constructed on this site a black UNK UNK has been encountered STOP 
START this is a black UNK clay in which about one hundred million years ago UNK trees were growing STOP 
START the UNK remains of many of these trees are found UNK in the clay STOP 
START some of the UNK are as much as three feet long but most of them have been UNK by the pressure of the UNK UNK STOP 
START although the wood has been changed to coal much of it still UNK its original cell structure STOP 
START in the clay are UNK millions of pollen grains and UNK which came from plants growing in the region at the time STOP 
START these UNK indicate the UNK was formed during the lower UNK period when UNK were at their UNK and when the first UNK plants were just appearing STOP 
START the 15th street UNK is not to be confused with the nearby famous UNK hotel UNK UNK on UNK street reported in the washington post august 2 1955 which was probably formed during the second UNK period and is therefore much younger STOP 
START working for peace recently the secretary of the friends committee on national legislation was interviewed on the air STOP 
START while i respect his sincere concern for peace he made four points that i would like to question STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START he said let's work for peace instead of protection from UNK STOP 
START i would ask why not do both power does not cause war is the result of UNK and lack of understanding between people STOP 
START are we not late especially those of us who call ourselves friends in doing enough about this lack of understanding STOP 
START as to protection the speaker UNK of shelters pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone STOP 
START is this a reason for saving no one the man with an empty life boat row away from a UNK because his boat could not pick up everyone STOP 
START the speaker suggested that the UNK of a UNK world would be too awful to face STOP 
START if the world comes to this wouldn't it be the very time when courage and american UNK would be needed to help survivors UNK of our young people think it would STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK the speaker UNK our organized program of emergency help calling it civilian defense STOP 
START in 1950 public law UNK created civil defense different from UNK of world war 2 a responsibility of the government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster natural or UNK STOP 
START far from creating fear as the speaker suggests UNK knowing what to do in an emergency gives people confidence STOP 
START civil defense has far to go and many problems to solve but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster storm flood accident or even war in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and UNK of dogs STOP 
START i feel that few UNK would be prone to break and enter into UNK apartment if they were met with a good hardy UNK that a dog would provide STOP 
START in addition would not the young female public of washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a UNK grant that the dog may not be really protective based on his training but if you were UNK the streets looking for a purse to UNK or a young lady to UNK how quick would you be to attack a person UNK with a dog would like to suggest that the UNK and commissioners get together and consider UNK the practice of UNK dogs in apartments STOP 
START sidewalk UNK use the UNK of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe senator UNK be serious in his proposal nothing in this country more sacred than the UNK comfort the idea of sidewalk UNK could be extended STOP 
START the lincoln and jefferson UNK are rather UNK STOP 
START why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat the UNK might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season STOP 
START as an added suggestion to balance the budget the government could sell advertising space on the washington monument STOP 
START it is visible throughout the city and men from madison ave. would jump at the chance STOP 
START sen. UNK UNK is obviously a man with a soul and heart STOP 
START he like most of us wants to be able to sit to UNK and be moved by the great UNK STOP 
START let us have more UNK and fewer forbidden areas around UNK and gardens STOP 
START let us like the french have outdoor UNK where we may relax UNK at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd STOP 
START UNK views of UNK two strong UNK from the majority report of the joint economic committee may 2 by UNK UNK and UNK UNK that the new deal fiscal policy of the UNK did not work STOP

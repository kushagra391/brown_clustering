START he rode in at the head of sixty UNK and UNK UNK and took over a UNK barn at the entrance to main street STOP 
START the entire length of the street could be UNK with rifle fire from this barn STOP

START for fifty years his guns and UNK fists shot holes through and UNK the UNK out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west STOP 
START the UNK of countless western UNK and UNK have been UNK almost to the point of UNK but because billy tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his UNK career his achievements and the UNK UNK he took while UNK the west have remained almost UNK STOP 
START citizens took the view that a UNK was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway but this fighting fury of a man UNK it regularly over a period of half a century STOP 
START he came within an ace of being UNK with bullets during his long fight with the UNK gang which UNK oklahoma in the UNK STOP 
START led by bill UNK these UNK specialized in train UNK but as a UNK they UNK stores and UNK banks making liberal use of their guns STOP 
START bill UNK ambition it appeared was to UNK out his name with bullets alongside those of UNK james and billy the kid and bill tilghman had UNK he would stop him STOP 
START tilghman knew that some UNK were UNK with the UNK gang STOP 
START they bought UNK cattle from the UNK kept him supplied with guns and ammunition UNK his men in their houses STOP

START if i don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse STOP 
START leaving his rifle in the wagon tilghman walked up to the door and UNK on it STOP 
START there was no reply so he UNK it open with his foot and stepped inside STOP 
START directly opposite the door was a UNK log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day STOP 
START seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher ed UNK STOP 
START UNK ed said tilghman STOP 
START the rancher UNK an UNK but didn't move STOP 
START tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire STOP 
START suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a UNK UNK and caused the hairs to UNK on the back of his neck STOP 
START along each side of the room were six UNK bunks each one UNK off with a curtain STOP 
START and UNK UNK through these UNK were the UNK UNK of six rifles all trained on billy tilghman STOP 
START the fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six UNK might UNK into his hide STOP 
START thinking fast tilghman never hesitated for one instant STOP 
START he walked right up to the fire as though UNK unaware of the guns covering him STOP 
START the men behind them were bill UNK and five of his gang every man a killer STOP 
START cold day said tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually UNK his UNK to the fire STOP 
START just dropped in to ask where UNK UNK lives STOP 
START can't seem to locate UNK in this snow STOP 
START the rancher was trembling STOP 
START he wouldn't look tilghman in the face STOP 
START follow the river for five miles he said UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK is on the south bank STOP 
START UNK the overwhelming temptation to UNK himself out of that UNK UNK tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes STOP 
START all that time rifle UNK were pointing UNK at his head and body STOP 
START one false move on his part and he would be a dead man STOP 
START well he announced guess i'll be going now ed and thanks for the UNK STOP 
START he UNK back to the door UNK softly hands still UNK behind him STOP 
START he left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been allowed to come out alive STOP 
START but he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon STOP 
START if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly STOP 
START UNK he climbed on to the wagon next to UNK brown STOP 
START don't say or do anything he said softly STOP 
START just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry STOP 
START that place is UNK with bill UNK and his gang STOP 
START even as he spoke those words billy UNK life hung on a thread STOP 
START back in the house a UNK named red buck UNK because billy had been allowed to leave UNK jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then STOP 
START you'll stay right here commanded bill UNK covering red with his rifle STOP 
START billy tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back STOP 
START we'll let him go STOP 
START but the fighting UNK UNK run of UNK from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell oklahoma where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK a UNK prohibition officer had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since STOP 
START that night he UNK out of ma UNK dance hall and proceeded to UNK the peace by shooting off his revolver STOP

START writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions that man can master the principles of this UNK universe and that such UNK will necessarily better the human lot STOP 
START on the other hand the bright vision of the future has been directly stated in science fiction concerned with UNK ideal societies science fiction of course is related if sometimes UNK to that utopian literature optimistic about science literature whose period of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced edward UNK looking backward and h. g. UNK a modern utopia STOP 
START in arthur UNK UNK end 1953 though written after the present flood of UNK began we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly defined STOP 
START UNK end apparently UNK to UNK UNK utopian romance UNK UNK UNK UNK and also to UNK histories of the future especially the world set free UNK and the shape of things to come UNK describes the UNK UNK of earth by the UNK UNK superior creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for its next stage of development an eventual UNK with the composite mind of the universe STOP 
START arriving just in time to stop men from turning their planet into a UNK UNK the UNK UNK earth into one world in which justice order and UNK UNK and ignorance poverty and fear have ceased to exist STOP 
START under their rule earth becomes a technological utopia STOP 
START both UNK of war and new techniques of production particularly UNK factories greatly increase the world's wealth a situation described in the following passage which has the true utopian ring everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free provided as a public service by the community as roads water street lighting and drainage had once been STOP 
START a man could travel anywhere he pleased eat whatever he UNK without UNK over any money STOP 
START with destructive tensions and pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human life UNK entire cities expanding facilities for entertainment providing unlimited opportunities for education indeed for the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the UNK STOP 
START mankind as a result UNK previously UNK of levels of civilization and culture a golden age which the UNK a very evident symbol of science have helped produce by UNK reason and the scientific method into human activities STOP 
START thus science is the UNK of mankind and in this respect UNK end only UNK in greater detail the vision of the future which though not always so directly stated has nevertheless been present in the minds of most UNK writers STOP 
START considering then the optimism which has UNK science fiction for so long what is really remarkable is that during the last twelve years many UNK writers have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future have attacked the UNK end kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably better the human condition STOP 
START and they have done this on a very large scale with a UNK flood of novels and stories which are either UNK or UNK of adventure with UNK elements STOP 
START because of the means of publication UNK magazines and cheap UNK and because UNK science fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be known though one fact is evident the UNK imagination has been UNK UNK in its UNK STOP 
START among the UNK for example UNK UNK the UNK of steel 1954 UNK the deadly effects on human life of the UNK of the future UNK a case of conscience 1958 describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction in underground shelters UNK UNK UNK 1954 presents a UNK society in which wall television and UNK UNK UNK men's minds m. miller UNK a UNK for UNK 1959 finds men after the great atomic disaster UNK back to their previous level of civilization and another catastrophe UNK the UNK touch 1954 UNK an economy of abundance which in order to remain UNK must set its UNK to UNK surplus production d. UNK UNK 1954 tells of a future when UNK have taken over leaving men nothing to do robert UNK the status civilization 1960 describes a world which frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it becomes static and UNK STOP 
START a more complete list would also include UNK the UNK 1951 philip k. UNK solar UNK 1955 david UNK one 1953 wilson UNK the long loud silence 1952 jack UNK to live forever 1956 UNK UNK UNK 1954 and UNK UNK UNK 1952 as well as the three perhaps most outstanding UNK UNK pohl and c. m. UNK the space merchants 1953 UNK UNK player piano 1952 and john UNK UNK 1953 works which we will later examine in detail STOP 
START the novels and stories like UNK UNK walk 1960 with the focus on adventure and with the UNK elements only a dim background in this case an uneasy UNK world in which the mass of people do UNK routine jobs while a carefully selected UNK elite runs everything are in all UNK as numerous as UNK STOP 
START there is of course nothing new about UNK for they belong to a literary tradition which including also the closely related UNK UNK UNK from at least as far back as the eighteenth century and UNK UNK UNK to the twentieth century and UNK we UNK war with the UNK UNK brave new world e. m. UNK the machine UNK c. s. UNK that hideous strength and UNK nineteen UNK and which in science fiction is represented before the present UNK as early as UNK UNK the time machine a story of the days to come and when the UNK UNK and as recently as jack UNK with folded hands 1947 the classic story of men replaced by their own UNK STOP 
START what makes the current phenomenon unique is that so many UNK writers have UNK a trend and turned to writing works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life STOP 
START since the great flood of these UNK has appeared only in the last twelve years it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief UNK was the 1949 publication of nineteen UNK an assumption which is supported by the frequent UNK of such details as room UNK along with education by conditioning from brave new world a book to which UNK writers may well have returned with new interest after reading the more powerful UNK UNK STOP 
START not all recent science fiction however is UNK for the optimistic strain is still very much alive in mission of UNK and UNK end as we have seen as well as in many other recent popular novels and stories like fred UNK the black cloud 1957 among works of UNK science fiction not all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature but then real quality has always been UNK in science fiction STOP 
START in addition there are many areas of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which are examined for UNK UNK often UNK political social economic UNK only indirectly related to science and technology STOP 
START nevertheless with all these qualifications and exceptions the current UNK phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology instead of bringing utopia may well UNK UNK and even destroy men STOP 
START how effectively these UNK can be presented is seen in pohl and UNK the space merchants UNK player piano and UNK UNK STOP 
START easily the best known of these three novels is the space merchants a good example of a UNK UNK which UNK much more than the impact of science on human life though its most important warning is in this area namely as to the use to which UNK in the UNK sciences may be put STOP 
START the novel which is not merely UNK but also UNK UNK describes a future america where UNK of the population the men who run advertising agencies and big corporations control the rest of the people the UNK UNK who are the workers and UNK with the government being no more than a clearing house for pressures STOP 
START like ours the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order to survive and like ours it is based on the principle of ever increasing UNK work and profits in the circle of consumption STOP 
START the consequences of course have been UNK UNK expansion has led to UNK UNK of the earth and UNK of its natural resources STOP 
START for example even the most successful executive lives in a UNK apartment while ordinary people rent space in the UNK of office buildings in which to sleep at night have replaced meat and wood has become so precious that it is saved for expensive UNK the atmosphere is so UNK that no one UNK walk in the open without UNK or UNK UNK STOP 
START while the space merchants indicates as UNK UNK has correctly observed some of the UNK consequences of the growth of industrial and commercial power and UNK existing habits in the advertising profession its warning and analysis UNK much deeper STOP 
START what is wrong with advertising is not only that it is an UNK an assault on people's mental privacy or that it is a major cause for a UNK economy of abundance or that it contains a UNK tendency which is closer to the point STOP 
START rather what UNK and pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent in UNK a science of man and his motives STOP 
START the space merchants like such UNK documents as joseph wood UNK the measure of man and c. s. UNK the UNK of man considers what may result from the scientific study of human nature STOP 
START if man is actually the product of his environment and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which environment determines what people do then someone a someone probably standing outside traditional systems of values can turn around and develop completely efficient means for controlling people STOP 
START thus we will have a society consisting of the planners or UNK and the controlled STOP 
START and this of course is exactly what madison avenue has been accused of doing UNK in a primitive way with its hidden UNK and what the space merchants accomplish with much greater UNK and precision STOP 
START pohl and UNK ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques of advertising which tie in with every basic UNK and UNK in american life which work on the UNK of UNK which are linked to the great prime UNK of the human spirit STOP 
START as the hero mitchell UNK explains before his conversion the job of advertising is to UNK people without letting them know that they're being convinced STOP 
START and to do this requires first of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the scientists in industrial UNK and consumer research who for example tell UNK that three days is the optimum UNK period for a closed social circuit to be UNK with a UNK UNK which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send an idea into circulation and then three days later UNK or UNK it STOP 
START and the second requirement for convincing people without their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered STOP 
START thus the UNK in the world of the space merchants is the person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet the person capable of putting together words that UNK and move and sing STOP 
START as UNK explains here in this profession we reach into the souls of men and women STOP 
START and we do it by taking talent and UNK it STOP 
START now the basic question to be asked in this situation is what UNK the UNK that is what are their values since as UNK says nobody should play with lives the way we do unless he's UNK by the highest ideals STOP 
START but the only ideal he can think of is sales again and again the space merchants confirm the UNK of the UNK that the UNK and UNK scientists once they have seen through human nature will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide them STOP

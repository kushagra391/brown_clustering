START let him become honest and they UNK him STOP 
START but let him be ready to UNK whatever UNK to UNK whatever character and to UNK his paper to whatever ends and they UNK him to their heart STOP 
START in proportion to the UNK of his moral worth is the increase of his worth to them STOP 
START to UNK the legislature and thereby UNK himself from a UNK situation pike took another course and made it appear that the legislature had been UNK STOP 
START he claimed in his attacks that woodruff with UNK UNK had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract without knowing what they were doing STOP 
START the charge was so UNK that woodruff paid little attention to it and answered pike in a rather bored way UNK UNK that a new hand was UNK the UNK of the UNK organ and UNK in a controversy with an UNK so utterly UNK of moral principles even a triumph would UNK the victor to no UNK STOP 
START the game is not worth the ammunition it would cost STOP 
START we therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the UNK reputation which the personal abuse he has UNK on us will UNK him to from the low and UNK herd to which he belongs STOP 
START despite UNK continuing refusal to debate with pike through the columns of his newspaper pike did not let up his attack for a moment STOP 
START over the months he became a political UNK with an UNK UNK of UNK poems UNK woodruff the UNK letters UNK woodruff and long UNK articles UNK woodruff STOP 
START so persistent were these attacks that in march of the following year woodruff was finally moved to action and pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics the subtle art of UNK STOP 
START to attack pike directly would gain woodruff little for as a UNK UNK pike had nothing to lose STOP 
START by this time woodruff had accurately measured pike as a man of great personal pride a man who would fly into a towering rage if his UNK were questioned and who would be anxious to UNK himself STOP 
START UNK honor would now come under attack but not by woodruff himself STOP 
START the charges would be made in the UNK by an anonymous correspondent and pike would be so busy trying to track down the UNK character UNK that he would forget about UNK woodruff STOP 
START the strategy worked perfectly STOP 
START pike was UNK by the first blast against his character which was published in the march UNK issue of the UNK under the name UNK STOP 
START the anonymous correspondent did not resort to UNK STOP 
START he called pike a UNK STOP 
START he said pike had stolen UNK from harris during the santa UNK expedition accused pike of continuing his UNK career in arkansas with the UNK of some UNK UNK in van UNK STOP 
START the charges caught pike off balance coming as they did from an unexpected quarter STOP 
START UNK he used the advocate of march 7th for a denial sending immediately to santa UNK and van UNK for documents to UNK himself and demanding that woodruff reveal the name of this UNK UNK who disguised himself under a UNK UNK STOP 
START woodruff said nothing and pike UNK UNK throughout little rock in an UNK search for UNK asking his friends to keep their ears open STOP 
START finally he learned through the UNK that the UNK might be one james w. robinson in pope county STOP 
START without further inquiry pike jumped to the conclusion that robinson was guilty and following the honorable route that would eventually lead to the UNK ground sent a message to robinson through his friends demanding that he either confirm or deny his UNK STOP 
START robinson did neither STOP 
START to pike silence was UNK to an admission of guilt and he determined to get robinson onto the UNK ground at all costs STOP 
START on april UNK he wrote an open letter in the advocate making it known to the world that UNK w. robinson is by his own admission a base UNK and a UNK STOP 
START if robinson was a UNK and a UNK he was also a very UNK gentleman for nothing that pike could do would UNK so much as a single word out of him STOP 
START preoccupied with his own defense and his attempts to get robinson to fight pike UNK his attacks on woodruff and finally stopped them altogether STOP 
START and pike never did find out if robinson was really responsible for the UNK letter STOP 
START UNK strategy had been UNK successful STOP 
START it took pike a long time to realize what woodruff had done and it had a profound effect on him STOP 
START once he learned a lesson he never forgot it STOP 
START in the next few months of comparative silence pike waited UNK until conditions were perfect for a new attack and then UNK a remarkable grasp of the UNK of political UNK gained from his first UNK with woodruff he used these changed conditions to excellent advantage STOP 
START shortly after the UNK incident a UNK began to develop between william woodruff and governor pope STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK honest governor pope had been the ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the UNK UNK of political UNK like UNK and he ruled the state with an iron fist UNK no nonsense STOP 
START woodruff had supported him all the way both as a chief executive and as a man STOP 
START besides being political allies they were also friends STOP 
START this warm relationship came to an abrupt end in june of UNK when the national congress appropriated UNK for UNK and printing the laws of arkansas territory and taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature left it to the governor to award the contract STOP 
START woodruff wanted this political UNK very badly and everyone assumed that he would get it because he was a close friend of the governor and his UNK UNK STOP 
START after all woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was the logical man for the job STOP 
START but because the governor was determined that friendship should not influence him one way or the other he looked for a UNK with a knowledge of the law which woodruff did not have and awarded the contract to a lawyer named john steele who had started a newspaper in UNK the year before STOP 
START woodruff was UNK STOP 
START considering the governor's act a personal UNK he UNK his feelings in the UNK on august 26 UNK we think the governor treated us rather UNK to say the least of it STOP 
START it is but justice to mr. steele for us to add that in the above remarks nothing is intended to his UNK either as a lawyer or as a UNK STOP 
START he got a good fat job and we UNK him on his good luck STOP 
START we hope that he will UNK it in a manner that will UNK him to credit STOP 
START as summer cooled into fall and winter even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow UNK by the day and by december of UNK it was icy STOP 
START it was at this point that pike decided to UNK on the bad feelings between the two men STOP 
START the eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract that woodruff still held STOP 
START from his first UNK with the UNK woodruff pike had learned that it was better not to attack him directly so UNK on the theme that the cost of printing was too high he condemned the governor for UNK such a state of affairs to exist STOP 
START to document his charge pike set up two parallel columns in the advocate showing the price charged by the UNK and the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere STOP 
START then he called on the governor to explain why STOP 
START the governor was not used to having his UNK questioned and he promptly passed the charges on to woodruff demanding that woodruff answer them STOP 
START if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation the governor insisted that he lower his prices in UNK with the scale printed in the advocate STOP 
START woodruff was now UNK on the UNK of a dilemma STOP 
START as a proud man his prestige would suffer if he let pike UNK to him through the governor's office but to lower his prices would be UNK to an admission that they had been too high in the first place STOP 
START as a consequence he did neither STOP 
START very angry at woodruff the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract UNK from the UNK and awarded to the lowest UNK which by a strange coincidence happened to be UNK advocate STOP 
START and for the moment at least the governor now found himself allied with the head of the UNK UNK he had formerly opposed and pike was credited with a clear triumph over woodruff STOP 
START but in the confused atmosphere of frontier politics UNK were as quickly broken as they were formed and as pike came to favor with the governor of the territory the governor fell out of favor with the president of the united states STOP 
START on january 28 UNK andrew jackson removed pope from office and elevated territorial secretary william s. fulton to the position STOP 
START fulton was a very close friend of jackson and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the old days STOP 
START as a UNK party man and a UNK democrat he had little UNK for UNK like pike and pike lost any immediate personal advantage his victory over woodruff might have gained him STOP 
START 2 pike proved himself UNK in the political UNK he also became a social lion in the village of little rock where he served as a symbol of the culture that the ladies of the town were UNK so eagerly to UNK STOP 
START after all pike was an established poet and his work had been published in the respectable UNK of that center of american culture boston STOP 
START his UNK and the fact that he was resident did much to UNK the UNK words UNK used to describe little rock after a visit there STOP 
START for some reason none of them were impressed with the territorial capital STOP 
START the UNK known UNK and UNK UNK UNK was typical of its UNK in the UNK STOP 
START little rock is a UNK UNK place STOP 
START he wrote STOP 
START little rock is without any UNK one of the UNK towns in the united states and i would not have remained two hours in the place if i had not met with some good friends who made me forget its UNK STOP 
START pike enjoyed his new social position UNK and UNK in himself those UNK necessary to its preservation STOP 
START he was especially popular with women for like the romantic poetry he wrote he was personally UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START he again began to play the violin and UNK the instrument beneath his chin performed UNK and romantic UNK to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered to hear him STOP 
START his artistic UNK guaranteed him entry into any social gathering STOP 
START he composed songs and set them to music and sang them in a soft UNK voice and when his audience had had enough of music he would UNK on politics or tell stories of his western adventures guaranteed to UNK the emotions of men and women alike STOP 
START the bulk of his early reputation however came not from his poetry or his music but from his excellence as an UNK STOP 
START by UNK the art of UNK had reached a very high level in the united states as a literary form STOP 
START the UNK of this period in order to earn a reputation had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his speech judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect it would have on the audience that heard it STOP 
START very soon after his arrival in little rock pike had joined one of the most influential organizations in town the little rock UNK society and it was with this group that he made his debut as an UNK being invited to deliver the annual fourth of july address the club sponsored every year STOP

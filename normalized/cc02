START television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family STOP 
START there seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of UNK jazz in prime evening time for example could not be justified without the UNK of a UNK UNK STOP 
START at least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for chicago and all that jazz presented on UNK nov. 26 STOP 
START the program came out of the UNK special projects department and was UNK in the du pont show of the week series STOP 
START perhaps special projects necessarily thinks along UNK lines STOP 
START if so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents STOP 
START as a matter of fact this latter approach has already been tried and with UNK results STOP 
START a few years ago a UNK UNK jazz show offered a broad range of styles ranging from UNK UNK big band to the UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START an enthusiastic audience confirmed the live character of the hour and provided the interaction between musician and UNK which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance STOP 
START about that same time john UNK tv series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do STOP 
START in an hour remembered for its almost UNK movement a score of jazz UNK went before the UNK for lengthy periods STOP 
START the program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music STOP 
START UNK stared at UNK faces in extreme UNK then UNK pulled back for full views of ensemble work STOP 
START chicago and all that jazz could not be UNK on the choice of artists STOP 
START some of the UNK performers were jack UNK UNK UNK UNK freeman UNK UNK russell johnny st. UNK joe UNK red allen UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the jazz UNK could hardly ask for more STOP 
START furthermore garry moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies STOP 
START he played host at the UNK show already mentioned STOP 
START one of the UNK big problems was how to UNK pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today STOP 
START UNK had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share STOP 
START for example there was sheet music with the word jazz in the title to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold STOP 
START samples UNK into UNK range in regular succession like telephone poles passing on the highway while representative music UNK the mood of the late UNK and UNK STOP 
START however well chosen and UNK arranged such UNK unfortunately UNK to more of an UNK than an UNK to the UNK main business which considering the talent at hand should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the chicago style STOP 
START another source of UNK pride was its rare film UNK of UNK UNK but this view of the great UNK flew by so fast that a prolonged UNK would have UNK out the entire glimpse STOP 
START similarly in UNK still photographs of early jazz groups the program allowed no time for a close UNK STOP 
START chicago and all that jazz may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the UNK UNK STOP 
START by trying to be both a serious survey of a UNK era and a UNK for today's artists the program turned out to be a UNK example of either STOP 
START still the UNK willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be UNK and future UNK happily anticipated STOP 
START even joan UNK may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the metropolitan opera audience attending her debut as UNK in UNK UNK di UNK sunday night STOP 
START the crowd staged its own mad scene in UNK of UNK and applause and finally a standing UNK as miss UNK took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic mad scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers STOP 
START her entrance in scene 2 act 1 brought some UNK applause even before she had sung a note STOP 
START thereafter the audience UNK UNK but UNK UNK reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain her UNK some UNK procedure and her acting uncomfortable UNK STOP 
START as she gained UNK during the second act her technical UNK emerged stronger though she had already revealed a UNK almost unprecedented in years of performances of UNK STOP 
START she UNK the UNK UNK STOP 
START each high note had the crowd in UNK so that it stopped the show UNK in the mad scene but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance UNK at the moment STOP 
START miss UNK appeared almost as another person in this scene a much more UNK UNK a UNK UNK who ran across stage while singing and an UNK UNK in her role STOP 
START what followed the UNK brought almost UNK silence as miss UNK revealed her UNK of a voice probably unique among UNK today STOP 
START this big flexible voice with UNK range has been UNK disciplined STOP 
START UNK at the start must have caused the UNK of her first scene or she may warm up slowly STOP 
START in the UNK of her vocal UNK however she could sing the famous scene UNK STOP 
START UNK it was fascinating UNK UNK and UNK quite realistic STOP 
START many years have passed since a metropolitan audience heard anything comparable STOP 
START her debut over perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine STOP 
START the performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor UNK UNK STOP 
START he UNK more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years STOP 
START he may respect too much the italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes but to UNK them in a UNK opera may be quite difficult STOP 
START richard UNK sang UNK in glorious voice STOP 
START his UNK UNK style gave the performance a special distinction STOP 
START the remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only UNK STOP 
START miss UNK first sang UNK at UNK garden in 1959 STOP 
START the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec. 9 will introduce her as UNK STOP 
START she has since turned to UNK whose opera UNK di UNK in a concert version with the american opera society introduced her to new york last season STOP 
START she will sing la UNK with it here next week STOP 
START anyone for musical UNK really quite fun as long as you like games STOP 
START you will need a UNK music system with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart and one or more of the new london phase 4 records STOP 
START there are 12 of these to choose from all of them of popular music except for the star release pass in review UNK STOP 
START this features the marching songs of several nations recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your UNK stand STOP 
START complete with crowd effects UNK by jet planes and UNK other touches of realism this UNK displays UNK new technique to the best effect STOP 
START all of the UNK carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program STOP 
START no reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music STOP 
START UNK is greatly exaggerated most of the time when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix there is excellent depth and dimension to the music STOP 
START you definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back STOP 
START this is a characteristic of good UNK recording and one of its tremendous advantages over UNK sound STOP 
START london explains that the very distinct UNK effect in the phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of UNK and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels STOP 
START these are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record STOP 
START in some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects STOP 
START some clue to the character of UNK approach in these UNK may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word UNK or UNK STOP 
START drums UNK UNK and other UNK instruments are UNK remarkably well STOP 
START only too often however you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right STOP 
START they are definitely in the same room with you but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK UNK pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day and johnny UNK UNK gives forth with UNK jazz in UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START big band UNK UNK seemed one of the least attractive UNK the arrangements just didn't have so much character as the others STOP 
START there is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these UNK apparently obtained at least in part by UNK the middle and high frequencies STOP 
START the penalty for this is noticeable in the big bold brilliant but UNK piano sounds in melody and UNK for two UNK UNK STOP 
START all of the UNK however are recorded at a UNK high level with resultant UNK of any surface noise STOP 
START pass in review practically UNK enjoyment and is a dramatic demonstration of the UNK of any UNK music system STOP 
START many hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic STOP 
START strange but true UNK and realism often aren't related at all STOP 
START almost every film bearing the UNK of hollywood is physically authentic in fact UNK so STOP 
START in any given period piece the costumes UNK vehicles and UNK bear the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START the major UNK maintain a UNK of film UNK and research specialists who look to this matter STOP 
START during the making recently of an important biblical film some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and UNK but of UNK developments sports UNK vehicles and other UNK were UNK consulted and UNK with STOP 
START but UNK the UNK seems to stop at the UNK edge STOP 
START the drama itself and this seems to be UNK true of biblical drama often has hardly any relationship with UNK at all STOP 
START the UNK in sort is wildly UNK STOP 
START thus in the story of ruth we have ruth UNK and UNK and sets that are UNK authentic STOP 
START but except for a vague UNK to the basic UNK i.e. that ruth remained with UNK and finally wound up with UNK the film version has little to do with the bible STOP 
START and in the new king of UNK the plot involves UNK and UNK and turns that cannot be traced to the UNK STOP 
START earlier this month edward r. UNK director of the united states information agency came to hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry STOP 
START he talked about UNK UNK too STOP 
START he UNK that they weren't doing the country much good in the cold war STOP 
START and to an industry that UNK itself on UNK he urged greater realism STOP 
START in many corners of the globe he said the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet STOP 
START would we want a UNK UNK or UNK UNK the UNK of america with movies as his prime source of knowledge for much of the globe hollywood is just that prime if not sole source of knowledge STOP 
START if a man totally ignorant of america were to judge our land and its civilization based on hollywood alone what conclusions do you think he might come to STOP

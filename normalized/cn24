START now the next morning they were UNK at the UNK and the boat was riding directly over the underwater UNK where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down UNK UNK with the UNK line beside it robinson roy who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive was already back on the surface STOP 
START he and his safety man UNK UNK UNK up to the UNK ladder together STOP 
START the german UNK indicated that robinson should mount first STOP 
START robinson UNK heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his UNK assembly STOP 
START he was frowning STOP 
START he took his UNK from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck STOP 
START temper temper mrs. UNK said laughing UNK STOP 
START a phony blonde hanging onto a UNK youth and beauty but UNK UNK in the neck she was already working on her second gin and UNK though it was not yet ten a.m. i UNK it rob said with a savage note in his voice STOP 
START all i have to do to set the record is to go on down STOP 
START so instead i come up STOP 
START was it my equipment german asked STOP 
START was it something went bad with the breathing the equipment was fine rob stated standing up STOP 
START he was a huge young man of twenty-four UNK in muscle UNK strong with a UNK UNK and UNK of manner that was UNK under his present UNK STOP 
START he stared UNK at the floor STOP 
START i was down to UNK STOP 
START i've been that far half a dozen times STOP 
START i don't get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick STOP 
START well i get it UNK said still on the ladder STOP 
START you are a big UNK UNK and you got this idea about setting a record STOP 
START and you also got this little spark in your UNK that tells you to turn around before you UNK yourself STOP 
START so you turn around STOP 
START no it wasn't that rob said STOP 
START a note of UNK came into his voice STOP 
START when i came up UNK i thought i was going down STOP 
START i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening STOP 
START UNK UNK said and climbed in STOP 
START that's right robinson said STOP 
START i was expecting it sure STOP 
START but when it happens to you like that i tell you and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were well it makes you think STOP 
START you don't head back down again STOP 
START not me anyway STOP 
START not right away STOP 
START he had his voice under control again no one became aware that he was UNK by what had just happened to him STOP 
START waddell the UNK was a fellow in his middle UNK with a UNK UNK UNK glasses and a large jaw UNK with fat STOP 
START now he was going to show how much he knew STOP 
START our boy didn't chicken out no sir STOP 
START he ran into the UNK of the depths STOP 
START nitrogen UNK STOP 
START it makes the UNK feel drunk STOP 
START well that's the only way to be mrs. UNK said and gave her UNK laugh STOP 
START maybe not if you're 200 feet under water UNK said STOP 
START anyway waddell went on STOP 
START it's nothing to fool with STOP 
START it can kill you STOP 
START personally i don't blame him for giving up the dive much as i UNK losing the story STOP 
START UNK giving anything up robinson said STOP 
START he stood there towering over them all gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group yet like a child among adults STOP 
START you think i got you and UNK and UNK UNK all the way out here just for the boat ride going down again STOP 
START that's my boy UNK exclaimed STOP 
START UNK not going to give up as easy as all that STOP 
START he was a UNK UNK man in his early sixties very UNK in his UNK cap UNK jacket and white UNK STOP 
START he went to key west every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of UNK was never used without irony STOP 
START old UNK UNK who had once lost a UNK bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without UNK turning on something else first STOP 
START now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again rob was his boy the kid he had UNK from the streets the object of his pride STOP 
START why he went on when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip i didn't think twice about it STOP 
START i've helped him along ever since he was a UNK hanging around his UNK UNK shop STOP 
START hell i gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven how many years ago was it rob seven years ago UNK rob said UNK STOP 
START he was thinking big deal UNK on his UNK fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when i started STOP 
START excuse me he said abruptly STOP 
START he went down the steps to the UNK and sleeping quarters into the forward UNK and locked the door behind him STOP 
START when you UNK go you UNK go mrs. UNK said STOP 
START waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge STOP 
START he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the UNK STOP 
START UNK there UNK he had said STOP 
START can i make you one no thank you very much UNK had answered in his UNK english STOP 
START i do not drink so much thank you STOP 
START waddell had looked the man over trying to size him up STOP 
START he was in his early UNK rather short and very UNK built and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to UNK himself to american ways STOP 
START his open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence STOP 
START waddell had heard that he had been a UNK in UNK UNK corps and he said to himself i'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night STOP 
START aloud he had said making conversation rob tells me he's using your UNK equipment on the dive STOP 
START yes UNK UNK had said STOP 
START he's one hell of a decent boy STOP 
START i like that kid STOP 
START i agree yes STOP 
START and if the dive goes UNK he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country is that right well no UNK UNK said STOP 
START waddell turned to face him STOP 
START no asked STOP 
START but that's what he told me STOP 
START why that's his main reason for making the dive STOP 
START UNK looked at him altogether without UNK and shrugged his shoulders making a little spreading gesture with his two hands STOP 
START what do you mean asked frowning STOP 
START please let me explain the german said earnestly his face still UNK of UNK STOP 
START i have in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year STOP 
START now i wish to enter the american market where the competition is very strong STOP 
START i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to UNK my products STOP 
START with all respect to a fine young man mr. roy is not able to provide these UNK STOP 
START waddell was not an UNK moral person but he did not like what he had just heard STOP 
START did you tell him all this asked STOP 
START perhaps not in so many words the german said STOP 
START but surely you have UNK mr. roy STOP 
START never never did i offer him the exclusive rights STOP 
START we spoke of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity STOP 
START he was most eager to make the dive course i was willing STOP 
START but there was no definite agreement about business arrangements STOP 
START well damn waddell said STOP 
START there was the end of his UNK feature story with UNK STOP 
START he started out the door STOP 
START one moment UNK said STOP 
START you intend to speak with mr. roy what else asked STOP 
START if you will UNK i think it would be better if not STOP 
START mr. roy is determined to make this dive STOP 
START whatever you tell him he will dive STOP 
START i know this from my talks with him STOP 
START well let's let him make up his own mind UNK said STOP 
START on the basis of the facts STOP 
START you will make him unhappy and anxious the german said STOP 
START at 200 300 400 feet under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will be thinking about what you are telling him STOP 
START it is not good mr. waddell you will do him great harm STOP 
START there was no doubt that UNK UNK meant every word of what he said STOP 
START waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk STOP 
START i am an honest man the german said with UNK STOP 
START i will give mr. roy his due for this dive STOP 
START i will make him UNK for all of florida a big market STOP 
START all tourists come to florida STOP 
START this will help him to get out of his little UNK shop STOP 
START yes there is no use causing him to worry at this time STOP 
START the UNK words worked on the UNK like a UNK from an UNK duty STOP 
START he took a big UNK of his drink STOP 
START it would be a UNK shame to throw away a story like this STOP 
START i think maybe you're right UNK he said STOP 
START he has the UNK for florida you say yes the german said STOP 
START at least for south florida STOP 
START by god waddell said we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times STOP 
START i guess you're right STOP 
START he UNK his drink around and UNK it in a few large UNK STOP 
START the story was UNK up UNK in his mind the young pioneer as of old UNK UNK the unknown UNK prompt and UNK in modern UNK america STOP 
START join me in another had asked STOP 
START thank you the german had said UNK STOP 
START i do not drink so much STOP 
START now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk STOP 
START fear and relief UNK in his UNK emotions STOP 
START he pressed his UNK together and addressed himself to the UNK saint of UNK in a hurried and anxious whisper STOP 
START blessed saint UNK i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when i was UNK STOP 
START and when i make the dive again he paused himself a UNK mary slowly and with understanding STOP 
START UNK between his hands the cross that hung from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters STOP 
START holy mary mother of god star of the sea stay thou with me on this next dive STOP 
START make it come off all right STOP 
START let me set the record this time and let me get back UNK so the german will give me the exclusive STOP 
START and make my life different and better from this time on STOP 
START amen STOP 
START he crossed himself again and rose STOP 
START he felt a good deal less UNK STOP 
START as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found UNK who came in and sat down on a bunk STOP 
START UNK had picked up a UNK and was UNK it on his UNK STOP 
START he waited UNK before he said roy you know your UNK table don't you you know i know it robinson answered UNK STOP 
START you came straight up from UNK without a stop UNK said STOP 
START well i was a little bit confused STOP 
START anyway i wasn't down long enough to matter STOP 
START you don't see me stretched out on the deck do you you know what they say about two deep UNK in one day UNK went on still UNK the UNK and studying it UNK STOP 
START i don't think you should go down again STOP

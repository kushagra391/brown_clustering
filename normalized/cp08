START rachel UNK me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the UNK STOP 
START bits of UNK lay in the UNK STOP 
START the air smelled UNK and UNK STOP 
START a young man appeared out of a side UNK and walked toward us with quick UNK STOP 
START he wore a long UNK coat of a heavy material dark UNK and black boots with UNK STOP 
START his black hat with its wide UNK high crown and fur trim rode high STOP 
START with his head erect he approached not UNK at us and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead STOP 
START he had a UNK UNK a small straight nose a short black beard and tightly curled UNK STOP 
START i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms STOP 
START the girls in the market place wore UNK UNK and covered their legs with cloth UNK STOP 
START i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road STOP 
START his hands were swinging at his sides and he passed through the UNK market place with his back straight and UNK on his UNK he entered an old stone building STOP 
START rachel had seen me watching the young man STOP 
START she smiled STOP 
START when your mother was here he must have been a young boy STOP 
START like the ones you will see now STOP 
START i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet UNK along beside rachel STOP 
START she led me into a twisting side UNK STOP 
START the dirty UNK buildings looked UNK up and their few windows stood high above our heads STOP 
START rachel said that schools and UNK occupied most of the buildings STOP 
START we entered one where the front door stood UNK and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor STOP 
START an old man with a white beard and dressed in a long UNK coat UNK UNK and a black UNK greeted us STOP 
START rachel talked to him STOP 
START he nodded UNK and UNK his hands over his UNK and UNK UNK at me STOP 
START i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were UNK but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor STOP 
START his toes pointed out toward the walls STOP 
START he stopped in front of a door placed a finger on his lips and still UNK down into his beard pushed open the door to a classroom STOP 
START we stepped inside STOP 
START he left us STOP 
START little boys crowded together on long wooden UNK and in the center of the room sat the teacher STOP 
START his black beard UNK down over the front of his coat STOP 
START one white hand poised a stick above his desk STOP 
START he turned his UNK UNK eyes toward us stared for a second then shouted in UNK one two three the stick against the desk STOP 
START the little boys UNK out a UNK translation or interpretation of the five books of UNK which they had previously UNK in UNK STOP 
START they UNK a fixed UNK in time to the report of the stick STOP 
START each boy opened his small mouth wide and UNK back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and UNK had studied and prayed in the UNK of europe STOP 
START the boys were tiny STOP 
START they had large bright eyes the small UNK UNK of all babies everywhere and hair UNK short except for the long UNK of UNK UNK their little white faces STOP 
START they bent over UNK UNK and looked up only to watch the teacher STOP 
START since they did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty for UNK STOP 
START the UNK language from the ghetto stopped STOP 
START the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in UNK UNK the stick UNK STOP 
START one boy who UNK back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and UNK STOP 
START his tightly curled UNK hung down to his narrow shoulders STOP 
START in the center of his brilliant UNK sat a small black UNK STOP 
START his head barely rose above the table STOP 
START i stared at him for a long time STOP 
START he did not return my interest STOP 
START my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys STOP 
START some of them ignored the UNK and had apparently UNK the words long ago STOP 
START they UNK the portion at the teacher who accompanied them in an UNK UNK and UNK them on with the stick STOP 
START the UNK defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake STOP 
START i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair STOP 
START his body UNK back and forth on the bench STOP 
START his front teeth were missing STOP 
START i UNK and backed out of the room STOP 
START rachel followed looked at me and UNK with her tongue STOP 
START we walked down the cool hall silently STOP 
START from behind us came the UNK of the stick and the UNK voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer STOP 
START i said how long do they keep that up all day she said STOP 
START except for UNK when they are UNK all day STOP 
START i rubbed my hands together STOP 
START they had turned UNK and UNK in the classroom STOP 
START the old man in the UNK clothes waited at the foot of the steps STOP 
START he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in UNK STOP 
START rachel said he asks for money STOP 
START she passed by him STOP 
START i reached into the pocket of my skirt UNK ten UNK and dropped the UNK STOP 
START then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man STOP 
START he UNK me STOP 
START i didn't look at him STOP 
START i grinned at rachel STOP 
START does this bother you said STOP 
START she smiled to herself STOP 
START most of our UNK think it's horrible STOP 
START when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass STOP 
START they said that we must not fight but wait for the UNK STOP 
START i was amazed STOP 
START you had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home STOP 
START you had to be stupid or crazy or UNK STOP 
START and i wasn't STOP 
START i was american STOP 
START you had to know also that you were going to fail STOP 
START all of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place STOP 
START i UNK them STOP 
START rachel faced me STOP 
START her bright eyes were UNK STOP 
START she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for us while we play around STOP 
START your mother hated this way of life STOP 
START she wished to change much for the children here STOP 
START i said quietly UNK what did she do here this section UNK her tongue behind her teeth STOP 
START here nothing STOP 
START but when she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country in the UNK STOP 
START she loved the children STOP 
START she was a strange woman your mother STOP 
START when she loved it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved STOP 
START nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted STOP 
START she stayed here to work for UNK STOP 
START for many UNK for many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother STOP 
START sometimes it was dangerous for her STOP 
START rachel grinned UNK STOP 
START but she loved danger STOP 
START she took it with her wherever she went chose it STOP 
START and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people STOP 
START she was most strange woman STOP 
START ready to follow her impulse STOP 
START it was an impulse when she was here in UNK UNK i was with her that led her to stay in israel STOP 
START your mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave their UNK STOP 
START here they did not need to be in UNK STOP 
START if she could not take the children out of this section at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms STOP 
START she set out to make sure that no jewish child UNK in the world had to live in a place such as this STOP 
START i said quietly gaining nerve ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to be UNK then why did she leave israel like to know that very much STOP 
START rachel UNK her hands together and slowed her pace STOP 
START the UNK of her UNK reported sharply on the UNK STOP 
START she UNK her lips then UNK them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me STOP 
START but she sighed and her face relaxed STOP 
START trouble came into her life STOP 
START she had good friends here people who liked her STOP 
START who loved her STOP 
START but she had to go out and hurt herself STOP 
START there was a man here in town STOP 
START he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted STOP 
START she worked very hard STOP 
START there was a UNK who was able to come here because of her STOP 
START he came with his son STOP 
START at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it was not so STOP 
START this UNK was a UNK man a big handsome man with a UNK to his walk as i have never before seen STOP 
START he had the black UNK on his arm so he had been UNK in a concentration camp STOP 
START yet he walked like a young man STOP 
START often he was terribly UNK and talked to no one STOP 
START then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe STOP 
START all his family was dead except for his son STOP 
START your mother would always UNK him when he UNK off and she would send him home to his son STOP 
START he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him STOP 
START then his son did something rachel threw up her hands i don't know what but something to an official here it was during the UNK and the son was UNK STOP 
START a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed STOP 
START she ran from a little group of us STOP 
START we were sitting together talking STOP 
START she went to the father and found he had UNK himself STOP 
START rachel paused STOP 
START it was silent in the stone UNK STOP 
START then she continued with energy i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father STOP 
START no one saw her except the man UNK STOP 
START yes i said STOP 
START i know him STOP 
START rachel gave me a direct UNK look STOP 
START she said UNK wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this UNK STOP 
START he said she would only hurt herself STOP 
START he complained to me once that i must talk to her STOP 
START when i did she shrugged her shoulders and said that UNK wanted her to marry him STOP 
START i asked her if she would and she said she would not STOP 
START he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him STOP 
START anyway i did not see her until two weeks after the UNK UNK himself STOP 
START she came to me one day STOP 
START she was pale and UNK was terribly alone STOP 
START and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to UNK and accepted his proposal STOP 
START he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself STOP 
START but now he was happy she would let him UNK out her life and take care of her STOP 
START he would never let her harm herself again STOP 
START for one whole week he never let her stay alone STOP 
START she let him lead her around STOP 
START he took her to a doctor for she was run down nervous did not care where she was STOP 
START UNK took her with him wherever he went STOP 
START he did not let her talk to people did not let her choose her own food STOP 
START she was limp and beaten from her loss did not care STOP

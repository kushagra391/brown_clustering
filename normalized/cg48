START he remembered every detail of his UNK movements but nothing of the final desperate rush to come to UNK with the enemy STOP 
START when the victory UNK went up this officer found himself still mounted with his horse pressed UNK against UNK log UNK in a UNK group of UNK STOP 
START his hat was gone the tears were UNK from his eyes STOP 
START he never knew how he got there STOP

START the UNK regiment of ohio volunteers lost one-third of its numbers within a few minutes among them being several men whose time of service had UNK but who had UNK to advance with their regiment STOP 
START the UNK regiment of ohio volunteers one of the UNK in UNK first division during UNK command suffered its greatest loss of the war in this action STOP 
START a popular belief grew up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thomas ever put his horse to a UNK was when he went to hurry up stanley for this assault STOP 
START sherman was responsible for the story when he said in his UNK that this was the only time he could recall seeing thomas ride so fast STOP 
START while UNK injured back led him to UNK his mount from its most violent UNK he moved quickly enough when he had to STOP 
START it is not in the record but he must have UNK his horse at UNK tree creek when he brought up UNK guns to save UNK UNK line STOP 
START while the final combat of the campaign was being worked out at UNK thomas on UNK instructions ordered UNK now commanding the twentieth corps to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without UNK his UNK to a UNK STOP 
START the UNK must have been sent after UNK on september 1 STOP 
START UNK made his UNK the next morning found the town empty accepted the surrender of the mayor and occupied the city a little before noon STOP 
START on the morning of september 2 the fourth corps and the armies of the tennessee and the ohio followed the line of UNK retreat STOP 
START about noon they came up with the enemy two miles from UNK station and UNK STOP 
START the fourth corps UNK and carried a small portion of the enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line STOP 
START that night a note written in UNK hand and dated from inside the captured city came to sherman stating that the twentieth corps was in possession of atlanta STOP 
START before making the news public sherman sent an officer with the note to thomas STOP 
START in a short time the officer returned and thomas followed on his heels STOP 
START the UNK thomas UNK the note and then making up his mind that it was genuine snapped his fingers UNK and almost UNK in his UNK STOP 
START the next day sherman issued his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to atlanta STOP 
START the measure of combat efficiency in an UNK campaign is a matter of personal choice STOP 
START sherman laid great store by place UNK STOP 
START UNK refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors STOP 
START by both standards thomas had the right to be proud STOP 
START thomas UNK his men for their UNK of purpose UNK endurance UNK UNK brilliant UNK and high qualities in battle STOP 
START sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was UNK and well executed but that the UNK of a part of his army UNK him of the larger fruits of victory STOP 
START he supposed the military world would approve of his UNK STOP 
START whatever the military world thought the political world approved it UNK STOP 
START for some time UNK in some northern quarters had been displayed in two ways an UNK for peace and a UNK with lincoln STOP 
START proposals were in the air for a year's UNK STOP 
START lincoln was sure that he would not be UNK STOP 
START in the midst of this gloom at UNK p.m. on september 2 UNK UNK to UNK general sherman has taken atlanta shattered the talk of a UNK peace and UNK lincoln into the white house STOP 
START to the republicans no victory could have been more complete STOP 
START official UNK UNK upon sherman and his army STOP 
START lincoln mentioned their distinguished ability courage and UNK STOP 
START he felt that this campaign would be famous in the UNK of war STOP 
START grant called it prompt UNK and brilliant STOP 
START UNK described it as the most brilliant of the war STOP 
START actually the atlanta campaign was a military failure STOP 
START next best to destroying an army is to UNK it of its freedom of action STOP 
START sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then UNK UNK it by his UNK retreat from UNK to atlanta STOP 
START but so far as its territorial objectives were concerned the campaign was successful STOP 
START within the narrow frame of military tactics too the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant STOP 
START in seventeen weeks the military front was driven UNK more than 100 miles STOP 
START there was a battle on an average of once every three weeks STOP 
START the UNK was almost constant STOP 
START in the summary of the principal events of the campaign UNK from the official records there are only ten days which show no fighting STOP 
START the UNK in the army of the UNK were UNK while for all three armies they were UNK STOP 
START men were killed in their camps at their meals and in their sleep STOP 
START rifle fire often kept the opposing UNK from UNK their pieces STOP 
START modern warfare was born in this campaign UNK UNK UNK UNK land mines extended order UNK UNK UNK UNK cars night attacks UNK UNK in trees UNK UNK and UNK which were the UNK of barbed wire trip wires to UNK a cavalry charge which UNK the mine trap and the general use of UNK STOP 
START the use of map UNK was begun when the senior officers began to select UNK points by UNK a spot as near the letter o in the word mountain STOP 
START a few weeks later the maps were being divided into squares and a position was described as being about lots UNK UNK and UNK with UNK forward as far as UNK STOP 
START this system was dependent upon identical maps and thomas supplied them from a mobile UNK press STOP 
START orders of the day began to specify the standard map for the movement STOP 
START sherman proved that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks STOP 
START to the rebels it seemed as if sherman carried UNK and bridges in his pockets STOP 
START the UNK of UNK UNK often UNK out the UNK of the UNK fire STOP 
START as always the ranks worked out new and better tactics but there was UNK in the way the field commands adopted these methods and in the way the army UNK incorporated them into their military thinking STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK thinking of the UNK military brain was not evident in UNK armies STOP 
START sherman could never be accused of UNK too long with the old STOP 
START one of UNK most serious UNK however was his UNK of his cavalry STOP 
START he never saw that it was a complement to his infantry and not a substitute for it STOP 
START then in some way this lack of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice STOP 
START a horse needed twenty pounds of food a day but the UNK got along with two pounds STOP 
START the UNK required eleven times more than the UNK STOP 
START so sherman tried a compromise STOP 
START he would ship by rail five pounds per day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could be picked up off the country STOP 
START it failed to work STOP 
START already UNK by the UNK UNK the quality of UNK UNK ran UNK as the campaign progressed STOP 
START every recorded request by thomas for a delay in a UNK movement or an advance was to gain time to take care of his horses STOP 
START well led properly organized cavalry in its UNK role to infantry had four functions STOP 
START first it could locate the enemy infantry learn what they were doing and hold them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over STOP 
START second it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy STOP 
START third it could threaten at all times and destroy when possible the enemy communications STOP 
START it could reach key UNK points faster than infantry and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot soldier STOP 
START its UNK role was to pursue and UNK a defeated enemy but this chance never came in the atlanta campaign STOP 
START thomas tried hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet but his plans were UNK when it was forced into a campaign without optimum UNK and with its commander stripped from it STOP 
START sherman knew the uses of cavalry as well as thomas but he imagined a moving base with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings STOP 
START his conception proved UNK but UNK and it enabled his enemy to make clean UNK well organized UNK with small UNK losses STOP 
START sherman insisted that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile UNK yet UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK cut two-thirds of the rail lines he had to break and sherman lived in UNK fear of what UNK might do to his communications STOP 
START when UNK pushed UNK through snake creek gap in a UNK decisive movement the only cavalry in his van was the ninth illinois mounted infantry totally inadequate for its role STOP 
START it stumbled on infantry where no infantry should have been and UNK aggressive impulse faded out UNK by fears of the unknown STOP 
START a proper cavalry command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into one division of UNK army of the mississippi moving up from the direction of mobile to join johnston at UNK STOP 
START from the night of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there was no union cavalry east of the UNK railway to UNK to sherman that he was missing the greatest opportunity of his career STOP 
START a great part of the time UNK infantry never knew the location of the enemy line STOP 
START at such times thomas wondered when and where a UNK would strike him STOP 
START it was the hard way to fight a war but thomas did it without making any disastrous mistakes STOP 
START heat during the atlanta campaign coupled with UNK clothing caused individual UNK that was compounded by a lack of opportunity to UNK and shift into clean clothing STOP 
START to relieve the UNK and sweat UNK the men got into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally the UNK line between the armies the UNK declared a private UNK while the men went swimming STOP 
START johnston believed that sherman put his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various UNK STOP 
START lieutenant colonel james p. UNK who commanded the first UNK of UNK first cavalry division was ordered across one of these UNK STOP 
START the water was deep and UNK took his UNK across naked except for guns UNK boxes and hats STOP 
START they kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels drove the rebels out of their rifle UNK and captured four men STOP 
START most of the rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff brush than their naked UNK STOP 
START rank was becoming an explosive issue in all three of UNK armies STOP 
START UNK recommendations from army UNK were passed over in favor of political UNK from civil life STOP

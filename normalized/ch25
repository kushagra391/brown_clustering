START the UNK or UNK UNK of which there have been too many recently may do more harm than good such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are UNK when the programs are UNK they are UNK no less by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit STOP 
START for the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of UNK whose judgments are known to be good such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time STOP 
START the central group of the foundation's UNK are at any one period of time the members of our advisory board consisting now of UNK men and women STOP 
START they are chosen by the foundation's board of trustees on the bases of their own UNK UNK in their different fields of scholarship and the arts STOP 
START their locations in all parts of the united states and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic UNK also are factors in the UNK minds STOP 
START for this concept of an advisory board UNK to the board of trustees we are UNK to the late president of harvard university a. lawrence UNK a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration STOP 
START that we had the wit and wisdom to adopt mr. UNK concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been it may be said truly pretty UNK good STOP 
START for in accordance with mr. UNK concept of an advisory board our selections are made by experienced UNK who give both UNK and consistency to our processes and our choices STOP 
START and lest we should become too consistent in the sense of becoming UNK of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts the foundation's board of trustees maintains a UNK not a flow of new members through the advisory board STOP 
START two committees of members of the advisory board constitute the committees of selection one for the selection of fellows from canada the united states and the UNK UNK area and one for the selection of fellows from the latin american UNK and the republic of the UNK STOP 
START to the members of our advisory board and most UNK to its members who constitute our committees of selection the foundation is UNK for its successes of choice of fellows STOP 
START we are as we know utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get quality of advice added to devotion to the foundation's purposes and ideals we do get from our advisory board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day STOP 
START but the facts about our advisory board and its UNK duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative on which to base our selections of fellows STOP 
START for example the interest of past members of the foundation's advisory board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were formally members of that board STOP 
START and besides there are a large number of scholars artists composers of music UNK poets UNK UNK lawyers servants of government and men of affairs hundreds indeed who serve the foundation well with the advice they give us freely and UNK out of their experience STOP 
START to all the foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of UNK in words how grateful we are STOP 
START it is a UNK of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management STOP 
START the same is true of every foundation STOP 
START during the UNK reviewed in this report our board of trustees named able men younger than the rest of us to the board and to top management to insure future UNK of the UNK administration of the foundation's affairs dr. james brown UNK UNK president of the bell telephone UNK was elected to the board of trustees STOP 
START he is a member both of the national academy of sciences and of the american philosophical society he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions STOP 
START dr. UNK n. ray UNK vice-president and professor of english in the university of illinois was appointed associate secretary general STOP 
START the trustees of the foundation appointed dr. ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present secretary general upon the UNK eventual retirement STOP 
START dr. ray is a fellow of the foundation appointed UNK to assist his studies of william UNK UNK and of h. g. wells and before his appointment to the foundation's executive staff had been given our highest UNK UNK appointment to the advisory board STOP 
START referring further to the foundation's officers dr. james f. UNK for eleven years our UNK UNK as associate secretary was promoted to be secretary STOP 
START he is a historian with the great merit of a UNK long view STOP 
START also appointed to the foundation's staff as assistant secretary is mr. j. UNK smith jr. STOP 
START mr. smith like the present secretary general is a lawyer lawyers with the great virtues that they are trained to read the fine print carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields are indispensable even in a foundation office STOP 
START the present secretary general has been the foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago STOP 
START but even he will not last UNK and the UNK new arrangements are quite simply made to assure UNK continuity in the foundation's policies and practices STOP 
START the effective recognition of excellence and its UNK has to be learned and is not learned in a day nor even in a year STOP 
START we are not given to UNK neither personally nor in these reports STOP 
START on the contrary if this be an UNK era as is commonly said we see it as an era of opportunity STOP 
START for UNK that there are great present-day problems to be solved these problems make great demands by their demanding tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth STOP 
START of this examples are UNK UNK speaking his funeral UNK in ancient UNK UNK after UNK and making it a testament of freedom writing the declaration of independence amid the UNK of revolution preaching the sermon on the mount close to his ultimate sacrifice speaking with the UNK UNK of the UNK voice words in the days of the spanish UNK threats UNK at the age of UNK UNK UNK UNK to two and fifty places during the great UNK year in england UNK UNK UNK optimistic and UNK UNK when britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago present-day UNK of outer space answering UNK questions of science and philosophy in the face of possible wars of UNK STOP 
START UNK et UNK UNK UNK UNK as the roman poet UNK declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today STOP 
START it gives indeed cause for UNK to remember what many UNK of the past produced it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind STOP 
START for example out of the social UNK of the english industrial revolution came the novels of charles dickens his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those UNK for all western men until today in the UNK west these social UNK substantially do not exist STOP 
START the solutions were not arrived at by any UNK of the UNK UNK UNK but by men of government lawyers most of them and men of business STOP 
START these were educated men who as mr. justice holmes was fond of saying formed their UNK out of experience under the burden of responsibility STOP 
START that is to put it UNK they had to run their businesses at a profit or they had to get the votes to get elected STOP 
START nevertheless they made UNK of UNK UNK that capitalism would never pay the workers to use UNK word more than a UNK wage with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the UNK pockets with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would UNK UNK and the misery of the poor increase STOP 
START but as all understand who have eyes to see nothing of the kind has happened the contrary has happened STOP 
START the gulf between the rich and the poor has UNK in the UNK western world to the point that the word poor is hardly applicable STOP 
START and the reason this could happen is clear men of government business men lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity STOP 
START some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit even putting it that way would not prove that UNK was anything but wrong STOP 
START sir henry UNK UNK a hundred years before communism was a force to be UNK with wrote his brilliant legal UNK that the progress of society is from status to contract STOP 
START the essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do STOP 
START hence the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice STOP 
START the greater the range of freedom for individual men the greater the range of choice greater the range of choice the greater the rate of change STOP 
START for change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future STOP 
START but when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose men individual men must remain in status and society does not cannot progress STOP 
START the eternal truth is that progress due as it always is to individual creative genius is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart STOP 
START and lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not UNK in a foundation report let me UNK them with the UNK that under communism there would have been no capital with which to UNK the foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellows might proceed UNK in every way toward their UNK their creative efforts for the good of mankind STOP 
START during the year 1959 we granted UNK UNK 1960 we granted UNK STOP 
START as UNK our UNK are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts STOP 
START we do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all UNK and artistic creation is good provided only that it UNK to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life as all UNK scholarship and artistic creation does STOP 
START indeed if pressed we would say what the late robert henri american painter said to a pupil anything will do for a subject it's what you do with it that counts STOP 
START thus we have no part and want none in current discussions of the relative importance of science the social studies the UNK the creative arts STOP 
START we want no part in such discussions because we think them largely UNK we think them largely UNK because for true excellence of UNK every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view STOP

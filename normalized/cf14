START everyone with a personal or group tragedy to UNK had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective UNK STOP 
START for almost two months the UNK and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers UNK UNK babies UNK beaten to death UNK UNK UNK burned STOP 
START one who had been a boy in UNK had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers STOP 
START the UNK humor of the nazis was not forgotten the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bearing a copper star of david nor the UNK UNK of UNK officers STOP 
START public relations UNK everywhere watching the reaction of the german press the liberal press the UNK press listening to their neighbors studying interviews with men and women on the street cried out too much too much the mind of the audience is becoming UNK the UNK are losing their effect STOP 
START and still another witness one who had crawled out from under a heap of UNK had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot STOP 
START most of this testimony may have been UNK UNK as bearing on the UNK UNK of the total nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the UNK department of jewish affairs STOP 
START counsel for the defense however UNK allowing himself to be swept by the current of UNK UNK rarely raised an objection STOP 
START would not the emotional UNK eventually brought on by this UNK have a UNK if not UNK effect likely to improve his UNK chances who feared UNK at the trial showed less understanding than dr. UNK of the route by which man UNK the distance necessary for UNK toward enemies STOP 
START UNK came largely from the bench which numerous times UNK the attorney general for letting his witnesses run on though it too made no serious effort to UNK off the flow STOP 
START but there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in UNK and those in moscow and new york STOP 
START in each of the last the trial marked the beginning of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old UNK and the UNK of UNK dictatorship the united states the UNK of UNK UNK with the UNK UNK in the UNK STOP 
START these trials were properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences STOP 
START but what could the eichmann trial UNK what new course could it mark the beginning eichmann case looked to the past not to the future STOP 
START it was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic UNK and of UNK the UNK that will last as long as there are jews STOP 
START as such it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a message STOP 
START it is not an individual that is in the UNK at this historical trial said ben UNK and not the nazi regime alone but anti-semitism throughout history STOP 
START how could supplying eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could UNK in the murder of millions of jews without being an UNK contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism if it was not an individual who was in the UNK why was the trial as we shall observe later all but UNK in the attempt to prove eichmann a UNK questions touch the root of confusion in the UNK case STOP 
START it might be contended of course that eichmann in UNK UNK UNK feelings was lying or UNK on a private definition of anti-semitism STOP 
START but in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case UNK by ben UNK and set forth in the indictment STOP 
START in such a case the UNK should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument STOP 
START one who could be linked to anti-semitism only by UNK his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the UNK throughout the ages STOP 
START UNK at eichmann though he might the UNK could not establish that the UNK was UNK the way he felt about jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-semitism STOP 
START yes he believed that the jews were enemies of the UNK and such a belief is of course typical of UNK UNK he believed in the UNK in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult UNK on the nature of things STOP 
START the real question was how one passed from anti-semitism of this sort to murder and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-semitism itself STOP 
START in regard to eichmann it was to be found in the nazi outlook which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-semitism a principle by which the UNK of anti-semitism itself was made more UNK STOP 
START perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could as eichmann declared feel personally friendly toward the jews and still be their murderer STOP 
START not through fear of UNK orders as eichmann kept trying to explain but through a peculiar UNK that began in a UNK of the vicious UNK contained in the nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of UNK UNK into a permanent UNK and sense of magical UNK that was able to respond to any proposal and the more UNK the better well let's try it STOP 
START at any rate the substance of UNK testimony was that all his actions UNK from his membership in the party and the UNK and though the UNK did his UNK to prove actual personal hatred of jews his success on this score was doubtful and the UNK lesson UNK to that extent STOP 
START but if the trial did not UNK the special nazi UNK so deadly to jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazis made such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it STOP 
START if anti-semitism was on trial in UNK why was it not identified and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press in its connection with the activities of UNK department of jewish affairs as UNK by the UNK and murder of jews by UNK and UNK UNK in germany as well as in poland UNK UNK UNK UNK conference called by UNK in january 1942 to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million jews spread throughout the nations of europe was attended by representatives of major organs of the german state including the UNK minister of the interior the state secretary in charge of the four year plan the UNK minister of justice the under secretary of foreign affairs STOP 
START the measures for UNK proposed and accepted at the conference affected industry transportation civilian agencies of government STOP 
START UNK in opening the conference followed the reasoning and even the UNK of the order issued earlier by UNK which authorized the final solution as a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the jews from german living space through violence economic UNK forced UNK and UNK STOP 
START in other words the UNK of the murder plan made clear that physically UNK the jews was but an extension of the UNK measures already operating in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-semitism that had made those measures effective as a readiness for murder STOP 
START this in fact it turned out to be STOP 
START since the magnitude of the plan made UNK impossible once the wheels had began to turn persons controlling german industries social institutions and armed forces became through their anti-semitism or their UNK of it conscious UNK of UNK crimes in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually STOP 
START what more could be asked for a trial intended to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to UNK the exact link between the respectable UNK and the UNK UNK in UNK anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man of affairs lay the potential warning of the trial STOP 
START no doubt many of the citizens of the third UNK had conceived their anti-semitism as an innocent dislike of jews as do others like them today STOP 
START the final solution proved that the UNK of any variety UNK himself as being UNK in the UNK and UNK of others STOP 
START ought not an UNK trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of mere UNK were drawn step by step into the program of UNK and UNK UNK in his opening remarks did refer to the UNK of anti-semitism among the germans which UNK UNK and transformed STOP 
START but if there was evidence at the trial that aimed over UNK head at his UNK in the societies where he UNK the press seems to have missed it STOP 
START nor did the trial devote much attention to UNK the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazis both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states STOP 
START certainly one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-semitism is to demonstrate its UNK as a dangerous weapon STOP 
START eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the UNK can be used to UNK the ordinary man of present-day society into a UNK to all his neighbors STOP 
START do UNK everywhere know enough about how the UNK of the jews in germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to UNK the UNK UNK apart individuals and groups UNK the UNK and most UNK impulses UNK trust and personal dignity and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the UNK by making them partners in UNK crimes career of eichmann made the trial a potential UNK for UNK UNK fearful of being mistaken for a jew he UNK protection in his nazi uniform to the UNK idea he is forced to overcome habits of UNK and UNK in power he begins to give UNK to a criminal UNK that causes him to alternate between UNK and UNK of those above him STOP 
START is this the type of citizen you desire trial should have asked the nations STOP 
START but though this UNK in no way UNK UNK guilt the UNK more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one would have none of it STOP 
START finally if the mission of the trial was to UNK anti-semitism how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting UNK of the countries in which the final solution was aided by native UNK i.e. germany poland UNK UNK and those in which it met the UNK of human solidarity UNK UNK italy UNK france not everyone have been UNK to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations UNK by anti-semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their jewish UNK from the UNK this meaning of UNK experience in various countries worth UNK the first collective confrontation of the nazi UNK the trial of eichmann represents a recovery of the jews from the shock of the death camps a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete though let no one believe that it could be UNK by silence STOP 
START only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin STOP 
START it is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the trial of what had been done to the jews of europe STOP 
START it is not that the facts of the UNK were UNK of the information UNK in UNK had been brought to the surface by the numerous war crimes UNK and UNK commissions and by reports UNK and UNK accounts STOP

START the UNK family had come from UNK UNK in the northeast of the main japanese island of UNK where there are still UNK of the mysterious UNK strain STOP 
START the UNK were a primitive people already living on the island before the principal UNK of the japanese came from southern asia STOP 
START apparently they were of UNK blood STOP 
START they had white UNK and blue eyes their men were UNK and many of their women were beautiful STOP 
START a UNK few of them are left now to UNK mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient UNK UNK which have the same UNK UNK as the UNK of the american indians STOP 
START most of them have been UNK but sometimes a man in UNK or UNK UNK is much more UNK than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be UNK lovely her UNK UNK and improved by a little of the UNK UNK UNK of the UNK from the south STOP 
START tommy UNK was one of these fortunate occasions STOP 
START she was UNK than most japanese girls and had the UNK UNK form of the japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall STOP 
START her nose was higher of bridge her UNK so pale as to be quite UNK to UNK and the fish and UNK diet of her UNK had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong STOP 
START her mouth soft and full was something for any man to dream about STOP 
START she had black eyes long and UNK tilted and the way she walked was melody STOP 
START she had been in japan just one week STOP 
START it was an alien land and she hated it UNK was already considering putting in UNK requests for duty at san UNK UNK the great UNK UNK any place the navy had a hospital with a threat to UNK her commission if the request were not granted STOP 
START anywhere would be better than the land of her UNK STOP 
START there was nothing wrong with her job STOP 
START tommy had been assigned to the UNK ward STOP 
START there were no UNK serious cases the ward doctor sometimes UNK up with the UNK to serve as a marriage UNK sometimes the navy sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage but mental health as a rule was very high STOP 
START at present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that japanese UNK firms were not permitted to operate on the UNK of UNK UNK too close UNK because the work involved setting off UNK UNK at all hours STOP 
START tommy was interested in UNK because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients STOP 
START but she suffered in her UNK hours STOP 
START such as now when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the UNK club having coffee and a UNK to sustain her until UNK STOP 
START she had changed into a cocktail dress and the whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck STOP 
START this was one of the navy's crossroads you find them all around the world STOP 
START ships from the west coast UNK on UNK UNK of duty with the seventh fleet and UNK was the seventh UNK principal port for maintenance UNK and shore liberty STOP 
START sooner or later all the gray navy ships came in here tommy sat long enough she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san UNK and long beach STOP 
START and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there STOP 
START she felt rather than saw the approach of the UNK young man STOP 
START he came through from the fleet bar which was UNK with the ice UNK UNK in a glass he carried STOP 
START when he saw tommy sitting alone the UNK sound stopped STOP 
START he was perhaps a UNK UNK having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently out of practice wore a brown UNK sports jacket obviously UNK in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant STOP 
START probably off one of the carriers an UNK STOP 
START there was a UNK chance perhaps that he would be UNK and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different STOP 
START japan did something to a man and it wasn't just japan either because the same thing applied anywhere overseas STOP 
START it was as if foreign duty implied and UNK license UNK that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different STOP 
START UNK UNK said turning on what was meant to be charm STOP 
START you UNK UNK you UNK date with me i beg your UNK said out of her cold rage STOP 
START i don't believe i know you and i can't understand your quaint brand of english it was meant to be english wasn't it UNK young officer fell back on his heels UNK and UNK STOP 
START at least he had the UNK to UNK she thought STOP 
START oh i'm sorry see i thought i mean i really had no idea oh yes you had ideas interrupted furiously STOP 
START all wrong ones she jerked her UNK toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped into navy UNK STOP 
START take off UNK UNK sorry muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool STOP 
START the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy STOP 
START she felt like a fool too STOP 
START it hadn't been this way in college or in UNK training wasn't this way in the hospital at san UNK STOP 
START everybody had accepted her for what she was a very charming girl STOP 
START nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places nobody had suggested that she wasn't american STOP 
START there are spanish girls who look like tommy UNK UNK with a UNK UNK of the UNK in their faces are UNK from the UNK states who are similarly UNK and back in the blessed united states they were regarded simply as pretty women STOP 
START now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for tommy was being UNK at every turn STOP 
START she looked around UNK STOP 
START four little japanese UNK were UNK the english language at the counter UNK UNK happened to be one of them STOP 
START everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called UNK a UNK UNK or UNK UNK one cup of coffee STOP 
START two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well UNK STOP 
START one was with a UNK and UNK lieutenant commander other was with her american husband and their UNK appealing children STOP 
START seeing these did nothing for UNK mood STOP 
START she told herself UNK and with pride i am an american so she was and would remain STOP 
START but she was learning that so long as she was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would always be UNK young men who would approach her with broken english STOP 
START there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese STOP 
START tommy wouldn't know coming to america her parents had spoken only english STOP 
START one thing was becoming increasingly sure STOP 
START she had been sent to the wrong place for duty STOP 
START there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward STOP 
START one had to have friends and a UNK life in UNK hours STOP 
START now there was UNK male singing from the fleet bar STOP 
START it was terribly off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself that male UNK was a very natural and important thing but all at once she felt UNK and UNK STOP 
START she finished her UNK and drank her coffee and paid her check got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated STOP 
START eating while angry had given her a slight UNK STOP 
START back in her living quarters at the hospital she took UNK of UNK and UNK STOP 
START then after a while she went to her mirror STOP 
START it was all true STOP 
START she certainly looked japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men STOP 
START and still they did not have to be so crude in their approach STOP 
START there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its tone UNK STOP 
START she promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of UNK which was not very far from UNK STOP 
START and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the UNK her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a UNK gown STOP 
START tommy of course had never heard of a UNK or japanese UNK which says UNK UNK UNK and is literally translated as relatives are better than UNK STOP 
START actually this is only another way of saying that blood is UNK than water STOP 
START doc UNK scheduled appearance at UNK UNK was a very unusual thing because the discipline UNK there is ordinarily for the young and UNK and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report STOP 
START but the beer hall UNK in UNK had been unusual too and UNK UNK was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in UNK UNK STOP 
START just why anybody should wish to start a UNK the executive officer didn't know STOP 
START in his opinion doc had not grown up STOP 
START the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief STOP 
START there had never been a good reason for doc UNK to grow up STOP 
START he had come into the navy too young with the image of the UNK guns UNK before him STOP 
START the war found him much too early and its UNK and especially its awful boredom were best forgotten in UNK and elaborate practical UNK and even now doc had never found any UNK UNK influence STOP 
START he remained young at heart with an UNK sense of humor STOP 
START he UNK about the UNK UNK of new men took great delight in UNK UNK with UNK UNK and gave no thought for tomorrow STOP 
START he was doing thirty years and the navy would take care of him STOP 
START the job security enjoyed by doc UNK and nearly all members of the armed forces is a wonderful thing STOP 
START actually all a man in uniform has to do is to get by STOP 
START he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired STOP 
START doc had been under UNK to the ship since the UNK left UNK STOP 
START this UNK him of liberty in hong kong but he told boats UNK that hong kong was a book he had read before and the navy would always bring him there again some day STOP 
START at UNK he was restricted to the UNK of the base because UNK UNK being thoughtful knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base STOP 
START this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment and suited him quite well STOP 
START there were two things he wanted to do inspect one of the many UNK that had been dug into the hills on the naval base and visit an old UNK STOP 
START a telephone line had been UNK up to UNK the ship with the base exchange STOP 
START after supper doc called UNK UNK who was now a lieutenant and had a family STOP 
START well doc you old UNK exclaimed with true affection STOP 
START come over and have a drink STOP 
START we live down by the base UNK STOP 
START grab a taxi STOP 
START i'll be there but i'll walk doc said STOP 
START i've got to run an UNK on the way STOP 
START see you in about an hour STOP 
START he threw a smart UNK at the UNK went up the UNK and turned down the wide street in front of the UNK UNK club STOP

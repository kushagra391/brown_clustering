START i called the other afternoon on my old friend UNK moreland the UNK literary critic his mother was born in ohio who lives alone in a UNK cottage on the UNK UNK raising hell and UNK the former only when the UNK gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is UNK and UNK such as human stature hope and humor STOP 
START my UNK friend does not believe that human stature is UNK in terms of speed momentum UNK or distance from earth but is a matter of the development of the human mind STOP 
START after UNK became the greatest man in the world for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in UNK moreland wrote me a letter in which he said i am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum or how far it can fly STOP 
START a UNK place is in the UNK STOP 
START i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy i told him at which he started slightly and then made us each a stiff drink with a trembling hand STOP 
START i seem to remember he said that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live STOP 
START did you go to their funeral i was wrong i admitted STOP 
START comedy didn't die it just went crazy STOP 
START it has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to UNK STOP 
START we now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of UNK but we also have horror UNK magazines known as horror UNK and sick UNK STOP 
START there are even publications called sick and mad STOP 
START the UNK is not crazy as a UNK or mad as a march UNK is UNK as a man STOP 
START i woke up this morning moreland said UNK lewis carroll STOP 
START do you want to hear the UNK can i bear it asked taking a final UNK of my drink and UNK him the empty glass STOP 
START just barely he said and repeated his UNK the time has come the UNK said to speak of UNK things of shots and UNK and UNK UNK of UNK and UNK STOP 
START moreland fixed us each another drink and said for god's sake tell me something truly amusing STOP 
START i'll try i said and sat for a moment thinking STOP 
START oh yes the other day i UNK some of UNK english UNK and there was an UNK about a group of english and americans visiting germany more than a hundred years ago STOP 
START in the railway station at berlin a UNK attendant was UNK foreigners this way this way woman she could have been either english or american went up to him and said but you are the foreigners STOP 
START i took a deep breath and an even deeper UNK of my drink and said i admit that going back to ralph UNK UNK for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy STOP 
START what's the matter with the music asked STOP 
START it doesn't UNK out the dialogue i explained STOP 
START let's talk about books moreland said STOP 
START i am told that in america you have UNK by UNK brought out by UNK for UNK STOP 
START is it all UNK there is UNK and UNK UNK i said STOP 
START speaking of UNK the other day in a story about a UNK demonstration the paris herald tribune wrote the UNK became UNK STOP 
START and then eichmann was quoted as saying in UNK that UNK plan to UNK the jews was nonsense STOP 
START if we cannot tell evil horror and UNK from nonsense what is the future of humor and comedy asked grimly STOP 
START UNK i said STOP 
START they require for existence a brave spirit and a high heart and where do you find these our present era of science and UNK the heart has been UNK to use one of our popular UNK UNK STOP 
START i know what you mean moreland sighed STOP 
START last year your tennessee williams told our UNK powell in a television program that it is the task of the UNK to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart STOP 
START like almost everybody else he confused the heart both as organ and as symbol with the disturbed UNK the UNK UNK and the UNK central nervous system STOP 
START i'm not pleading for the heart that UNK up when it UNK a UNK in the sky or for the heart that with UNK UNK and dances with the UNK STOP 
START the sentimental pure heart of UNK is gone with the UNK years but i still believe in the heart of the george meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks STOP 
START we no longer have tom UNK and UNK heart for any fate either i said STOP 
START moore and UNK didn't have the fate that faces us moreland said STOP 
START one day our species promises UNK and the next day it UNK UNK STOP 
START we sat for a while drinking in silence STOP 
START the heart i said finally is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes STOP 
START when it was worn in the breast or even on the sleeve we at least knew where it was STOP 
START there was a long silence STOP 
START you have visited england five times in the past UNK i believe my host said STOP 
START what has impressed you most on your present visit i would say depressed not impressed i told him STOP 
START i should say it is the turning of courts of law into UNK UNK for sex UNK involving UNK and UNK UNK and patients STOP 
START it is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political UNK from the modern theatre STOP 
START do you think we need a new henry james to UNK the UNK scene asked STOP 
START or perhaps a new UNK UNK but you must have heard it said that the UNK disappeared forever with the UNK years of james and the UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START i myself hear it said constantly in UNK STOP 
START in them there is usually a group of UNK with UNK problems worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and UNK STOP 
START i stood up and began UNK STOP 
START if you are trying to get us out of the UNK the UNK the kitchen sink and the UNK UNK you are probably UNK your time moreland told me STOP 
START too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the UNK or from under the rock STOP 
START UNK and UNK i said STOP 
START i am worried about the current meanings of the word funny STOP 
START it now means ominous as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor as when one says that a friend is acting funny frightening as when a wife tells the police that it is funny but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights STOP 
START moreland sat brooding for a full minute during which i made each of us a new drink STOP 
START he took his glass UNK it against mine and said UNK UNK what the hell a line from don UNK UNK STOP 
START be careful of the word gay for it too has UNK a change STOP 
START it now means in my country UNK i said STOP 
START oh i forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon he is removed to a mental institution in an UNK STOP 
START recently by the way i received a questionnaire in which i was asked whether or not i was UNK STOP 
START my host went over and stared out the window at his UNK he turned to me STOP 
START is it true that you believe the other animals are UNK than the human species oh that is UNK i told him STOP 
START do you remember the woman in the french UNK who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun UNK UNK told the sheep the world is coming to an end the sheep said all in UNK i have no doubt UNK sound UNK of sheep is like the UNK horse laugh STOP 
START that is only partly UNK he began STOP 
START if you saw the drama called UNK i said think of the effect it would have on an audience of UNK when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a UNK STOP 
START the UNK would panic screaming help if that can be screamed in their language STOP 
START you think the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy demanded STOP 
START UNK no i said STOP 
START the political and intellectual left began fighting humor and comedy years ago because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage such as UNK and irony such as humor and comedy STOP 
START nevertheless like any other human being upon whom the UNK of the world plays continually khrushchev the UNK UNK has become a UNK actor or thinks he has STOP 
START in his famous meeting with nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as ed UNK STOP 
START but like UNK he has only one joke so far as i can find out STOP 
START it consists in saying that would be sending the UNK to look after the UNK STOP 
START why in the name of his UNK doesn't he vary it a bit such as asked STOP 
START such as sending the cat to guard the UNK or the UNK to protect the UNK or most terribly sharp of all the human being to save humanity STOP 
START you and i have fallen out of literature into politics moreland observed STOP 
START what a UNK fall was there said STOP 
START moreland went over to stare at his UNK again and then came back and sat down UNK STOP 
START the world that was once UNK and UNK he said has now become UNK and UNK STOP 
START in our age of science and UNK it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our UNK and explore outer space STOP 
START the human ego being what it is i put in science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like UNK UNK fruit UNK STOP 
START it seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species STOP 
START now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again moreland protested STOP 
START not in the largest sense of the words i said STOP 
START the other day arnold UNK spoke against the UNK tendency of our species to believe in the UNK of its religions its UNK and its virtually everything else STOP 
START why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it UNK in something else years ago an english writer w. l. george dealt with this subject in UNK of the day and said as an example that saint george for UNK england would not start a spirit half so quickly as strike UNK UNK dead there was also UNK UNK UNK moreland reminded me and UNK UNK UNK or if you will UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START it isn't what the UNK believes in but what he UNK that puts the world in UNK STOP 
START this is the force in our time and in every other time that UNK the UNK and the UNK to become head of a state STOP 
START complete power not only UNK but it also UNK the mad STOP 
START there is a bitter UNK for a future writer in that STOP 
START great UNK has always been clearly written and readily understandable i said STOP 
START but we now find writers UNK by the UNK and UNK of their ivory UNK and curiously devoted to the growing UNK and complexity of poetry and UNK STOP 
START i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about STOP

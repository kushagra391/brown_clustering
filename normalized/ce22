START to the UNK it was a brilliant UNK on UNK the UNK it was a challenge to the UNK world STOP 
START what was it to prokofieff UNK UNK of UNK ideas trial UNK to test the aesthetic climate of the times brilliant piece de resistance its composer was an UNK star on a new world horizon STOP 
START i heard the classical symphony for the first time when UNK conducted it in paris in 1927 STOP 
START all musical paris was there STOP 
START some musicians were enthusiastic some UNK STOP 
START i myself was one of the UNK 35 years ago STOP 
START i remember UNK UNK in the UNK shouting in his UNK voice it may be a tour de force UNK UNK UNK can anyone take this music seriously answer is yes america took prokofieff and his classical symphony seriously and with a good deal of pleasure STOP 
START his UNK friend UNK UNK gave UNK of his praise and brilliant performances in boston new york and washington d.c. to which he added UNK and UNK for the whole nation STOP 
START chicago was also a welcome host there in UNK prokofieff conducted the world UNK of the love for three UNK and played the first performance of his third piano concerto STOP 
START uncle sam was indeed a rich uncle to prokofieff in those UNK UNK victory years of peace and prosperity bold UNK and UNK enjoyment and pleasure the golden UNK STOP 
START we attended the UNK of his UNK UNK and UNK studied taught and performed his piano UNK chamber music UNK and UNK bought his records and played them in our schools and universities STOP 
START we unanimously agreed that prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of UNK composers STOP 
START nevertheless prokofieff was much influenced by paris during the UNK the paris which was the artistic center of the western world the social paris to which russian UNK UNK the UNK paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich america the UNK paris of UNK UNK UNK UNK picasso the UNK paris of UNK and UNK art the paris UNK which took young composers to her UNK with such quick and easy UNK STOP 
START so young prokofieff was the darling of success in his UNK the UNK hunting grounds of uncle sam the exciting UNK of his lovely brilliant paris UNK of UNK excess and abandon world theatre of UNK UNK in tone color dance design and thought STOP 
START meanwhile three great terrible forces were UNK and UNK STOP 
START in this world-wide UNK of men minds and machines prokofieff was recalled to his native land STOP 
START the world UNK when UNK UNK all concepts of peace and liberty and the UNK UNK peoples of the UNK and socialist UNK combined forces to UNK UNK tyranny into UNK UNK STOP 
START after this UNK a changing world occupied the minds of men world UNK with new boundaries new UNK and governments new goals and methods and the UNK fears of UNK and UNK hunger and exposure STOP 
START in this changed world prokofieff settled to find himself and to create for large national purpose STOP 
START here this happy UNK son of good fortune proved that he could accept the UNK of a new UNK order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a UNK world STOP 
START here prokofieff became a UNK in the UNK of socialism producing music for the masses STOP 
START it is at this point in his life that the mature prokofieff UNK STOP 
START one might have expected that such a violent UNK of transition would have destroyed the creative UNK of a composer especially one whose works were so UNK and spontaneous STOP 
START but no prokofieff grew STOP 
START he accepted the environment of his destiny took root and grew to UNK the stature of his early promise STOP 
START by UNK he had UNK his intentions to serve his people i have UNK for clarity and UNK UNK but at the same time i have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody STOP 
START this is precisely what makes UNK UNK music so difficult to UNK the clarity must be new not old STOP 
START how right he was clearly he saw the cultural UNK of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern UNK STOP 
START and with what UNK did prokofieff back up his UNK of words with UNK of powerful music STOP 
START compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and UNK little classical symphony and his big muscular passionate and eloquent fifth symphony the love for three UNK gay as it is with the wonderful imaginative colorful and subtle UNK of the magnificent ballet the stone flower STOP 
START this UNK has UNK too but it is the UNK of dancing people UNK UNK and humorous STOP 
START of course these works are not comparable even though the same brain conceived them STOP 
START the early works were conceived for a sophisticated international audience later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens STOP 
START however in all of UNK music young or mature we find his profile his UNK his UNK attitude STOP 
START prokofieff never UNK his medium for the cause of experimentation per UNK STOP 
START in UNK he UNK the limits of UNK with good judgment and a fine imagination for color STOP 
START his sense for rhythmic variety and timing is UNK STOP 
START his creative development of UNK designs of UNK dance UNK and love songs is UNK UNK clever UNK and subtle STOP 
START his UNK is pertinent UNK and rarely thick STOP 
START also it should be noted that the UNK freedom of his UNK and UNK UNK the brilliant UNK the UNK for UNK the UNK of figured bass the skill in UNK UNK were not lost in his mature output even in the spectacular historical UNK of the stage and UNK where a large dramatic canvas of sound was required STOP 
START that UNK UNK and forms sometimes seem UNK routine to our ears may or may not indicate that he was less of an original than we prefer to believe STOP 
START need for UNK may be a UNK of cultural fatigue and UNK STOP 
START prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero who by the force of his creative life helped preserve the main stream of tradition to which the surviving UNK of current UNK may be eventually added and integrated STOP 
START at this date it seems probable that the name of UNK prokofieff will appear in the UNK of history as an effective UNK who was fully aware of the UNK and danger of experimentation and used it as it served his purpose was never caught up in it never a slave to its academic UNK STOP 
START certainly it is the traditional clarity of his music which has UNK him to the western world not his UNK STOP 
START so prokofieff was able to UNK his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them STOP 
START nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have done better or even as well under different circumstances STOP 
START his UNK UNK UNK certainly did not STOP 
START why did prokofieff expand in stature and UNK while UNK who leaped into fame like a young giant UNK in stature and UNK think the answer is to be found in UNK own words the clarity must be new not old STOP 
START when prokofieff UNK his new clarity of UNK UNK music so difficult to UNK he shaped his talents to his purpose STOP 
START when UNK shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures many UNK many UNK many personalities he tried to UNK himself into a UNK of many styles determined by many UNK cultures STOP 
START prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people by the compass of their national ideas STOP 
START but UNK was UNK by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting STOP 
START in all his UNK UNK made the fatal historical UNK of UNK that he could UNK other UNK UNK representing many peoples time periods and styles into his own music by UNK the harmony melody or form to UNK his own experiments STOP 
START because of the authentic UNK of his early UNK materials and his UNK for UNK his brilliant UNK his savage UNK du UNK his UNK UNK UNK the world kept hoping that he could UNK the historical direction for which his native talents were UNK STOP 
START but time is running out and many of UNK UNK begin to fear that he will never find UNK UNK STOP 
START his various aesthetic UNK remain as UNK of a house divided against itself UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and most recently UNK all competing with each other within one composer a UNK of UNK and UNK and UNK UNK UNK to UNK our memories of a once mighty UNK UNK UNK of our national UNK the UNK UNK poor attempt to write an UNK jazz concerto UNK UNK for UNK hopes that the UNK from his old music might be used for popular american commercial songs nearing the age of eighty is like a lost and frantic bird UNK from one abandoned nest to another searching for a home STOP 
START how differently UNK life UNK STOP 
START prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction STOP 
START in the process his native UNK were stretched UNK and disciplined to serve their human purpose STOP 
START with a large and UNK UNK technique he UNK the materials of national heroes and events national folklore and children's UNK tales UNK dances and love songs into a solid musical literature which served his people well and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large STOP 
START of course it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical UNK prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him and economic security UNK opera and ballet companies chamber music UNK and eager audiences STOP 
START it must be conceded that his native land provided prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunities UNK UNK social UNK for a new national ideology a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to UNK his purpose STOP 
START thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist UNK produced one of the great composers of the twentieth century STOP 
START that his UNK even in his early years are those of his people does him honor as his music honors those who inspired it STOP 
START that he UNK every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of UNK and UNK the UNK of a new culture perhaps of even greater significance his music is strong UNK evidence of the effectiveness of evolution based on a broad UNK for the creative art of music STOP 
START april 10 marked a memorable date in new UNK musical history indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern united states STOP 
START on that date the musicians emergency fund organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain UNK during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their UNK in the stock market crash observed its UNK anniversary STOP

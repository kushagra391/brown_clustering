START too often a beginning UNK has to do his training UNK either because his parents don't want UNK to lift all those old UNK things because you'll UNK your growth or because childish UNK from his UNK like hey UNK mr. america gonna do with all those muscles of which he has none at the time all a UNK UNK have a little ego it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy UNK who has never had to train in secret has never heard one UNK word from his parents and never has been UNK by his UNK happy always smiling UNK with the sunny disposition is our new junior mr. canada henri de UNK STOP 
START far from UNK henri his parents urge him on to greater and greater UNK STOP 
START instead of UNK him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master UNK UNK authority professor UNK claude STOP 
START and they couldn't have UNK henri to better hands because le UNK knows his muscles from the UNK UNK of the neck right down to the UNK UNK of the leg and better still he knows just what exercises work best for them and what UNK principles to combine them with for fast fast muscle growth STOP 
START that's because the good professor teaches only UNK methods at his famous UNK health studio which is located at UNK UNK royal east in UNK STOP 
START undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his UNK pupils every pupil has a UNK title of some kind or other STOP 
START there's UNK UNK who is our newest mr. canada UNK whose story appeared here two issues ago UNK who was with us last month UNK who recently won the most muscular man subdivision award in the mr. canada event a host of others STOP 
START UNK the professor knows his muscles when henri was just 12 he was only UNK UNK tall and weighed an UNK UNK pounds and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight STOP 
START about that time he began reading mr. america and muscle builder and he learned of the famous UNK way to fast weight gaining STOP 
START seeing so many illustrations and reading so many UNK to the value of UNK and UNK those two UNK UNK food UNK he decided to try them and see what they could do for him STOP 
START well sir they did real great in almost less time than it takes to tell it UNK UNK was increasing rapidly STOP 
START of course he did some UNK STOP 
START he's crazy about water UNK and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food UNK packed pounds of solid muscle on his UNK frame STOP 
START henri has always had UNK legs from swimming and water UNK and really doesn't have to work them very much STOP 
START but he was totally UNK with his upper body STOP 
START it was muscular but it wasn't UNK STOP 
START a real nothing UNK says henri STOP 
START it never seemed to UNK STOP 
START it just got longer and longer STOP 
START that's when he went to professor claude STOP 
START and at once claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it STOP 
START in his UNK the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment since UNK UNK STOP 
START mr. claude is a specialist in UNK development and he has long favored the UNK UNK UNK UNK technique in which one exercise of the UNK is a pressing or pushing movement which UNK one sector of a muscle group in a specific way followed by a pulling exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group STOP 
START so right away claude introduced henri to his famous moon bench and proceeded to teach him his first UNK UNK consisting of the UNK UNK UNK the pull part of the UNK UNK which UNK UNK the UNK and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the UNK bench press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide UNK UNK UNK while UNK the upper UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START as you can see in this UNK UNK set the entire UNK area is vigorously exercised in alternate UNK by alternate exercises so the complete UNK remains UNK all the time when henri has completed four complete UNK UNK no. 1 the professor allows him about a UNK rest period before starting him on four complete UNK UNK no. 2 STOP 
START UNK no. 2 is made up of similar exercises but this time done with UNK and using both moon and flat UNK STOP 
START the push exercise of this UNK UNK is the bench press done with UNK well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the UNK not possible with the UNK variation STOP 
START you need the UNK variation to build width and mass in the UNK STOP 
START the UNK variation develops a most UNK UNK outline to the aj STOP 
START the pull exercise in this UNK is the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START note how strongly the upper UNK and UNK are worked in this fine exercise because of the UNK concentration of force which the UNK variation UNK STOP 
START in the third UNK UNK the push exercise is the UNK UNK between bars while the pull exercise is the moon bench UNK raise with bent arms STOP 
START the UNK done in this manner is the greatest UNK UNK ever invented is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved STOP 
START you'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch you see the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the UNK to use a UNK grip STOP 
START he has to just can't do anything about it at all as you can also see it's not a painful exercise at all because henri de UNK the happy UNK looks as though he were having the time of his life last exercise of UNK UNK prescribed program for henri is a single exercise done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets STOP 
START by this time UNK entire UNK area is UNK to almost bursting point and claude takes time to do a bit more UNK UNK UNK work STOP 
START he has henri do from four to six sets of the UNK bench press note the high UNK STOP 
START this gives a wide UNK to the UNK causing them to flow UNK upward into UNK and UNK downward into the UNK and aj STOP 
START this is the kind of chest that invariably UNK UNK UNK UNK rock looks of the great UNK STOP 
START so with four complete UNK UNK no. 1 four of no. 2 four of no. 3 and four to six sets of the UNK bench press you can see that henri de UNK has had a UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK that cannot be improved upon STOP 
START UNK UNK are rarely won on muscle size alone STOP 
START UNK still is a mr. america or mr. universe of true UNK build STOP 
START the aspects of physical development that catch the UNK eyes and which UNK influence their decisions are UNK and that UNK of the true champion superior definition of the muscles STOP 
START now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START but contest definition that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a UNK UNK is something quite different STOP 
START this comes not alone from UNK UNK training but from certain UNK exercises which the champion UNK for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him STOP 
START often these exercises work well for some UNK but less UNK for others STOP 
START because they are minority exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the UNK of the forgotten STOP 
START only when the newest mr. america or mr. universe UNK them and puts them into practice are we UNK with them and once again see how effective they really are STOP 
START the exercise i shall discuss in this the first of a new series of articles on muscle UNK of a particular body part is the one leg UNK STOP 
START why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone no matter whether he has short or long UNK lengths is the one exercise that UNK influences the definition of the UNK at the UNK that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other UNK criterion of muscle drama that is UNK to judges and audiences alike UNK of muscular development that UNK UNK STOP 
START definition of the UNK at the UNK part is quite commonly seen in most UNK UNK UNK which is easily understandable STOP 
START the one leg UNK is a split and all UNK practice this in their regular UNK STOP 
START but for purely definition purposes used in conjunction with your regular UNK leg UNK leg UNK programs a heavy weight is not needed STOP 
START indeed a lighter weight works much better because a greater more extensive split can be performed STOP 
START used in several sets of high UNK once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a UNK definition in which the muscles look like wire UNK UNK and twisting under the skin there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times for the following suggestions show why it is so effective 1 STOP 
START UNK a complete UNK UNK exercise STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlit places UNK tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START -hlit improves over-all balance and control for the UNK and helps to make UNK more easily and more correctly performed STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START -hlit increases flexibility of the legs STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START -hlit speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced UNK because each UNK and leg is exercised separately thus enabling a massive concentrated effort to be focused on each STOP 
START you'll need your UNK power stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done 1 STOP 
START UNK your power stands in position and adjust their height so that this will UNK to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy clean STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK a UNK UNK across them the bar which will rest against the back of your neck your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split STOP 
START now raise the weight by UNK your front leg without moving your feet STOP 
START when the front knee is straight and locked allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the power stands STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK you have taken a UNK reverse the position of your legs so that the front UNK of the previous exercise is now to the rear and the rear UNK now to the front and perform the same movement in the same manner STOP 
START that's the UNK UNK in a UNK STOP 
START you should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety STOP 
START you should also begin this exercise with a very light UNK until you become accustomed to it UNK STOP 
START oh you'll UNK and UNK quite a bit at first STOP 
START but don't worry STOP 
START before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and UNK yourself just like a veteran i suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK would both benefit UNK by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front STOP

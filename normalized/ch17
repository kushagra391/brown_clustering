START it is not a medieval mental UNK or an attitude UNK by sense to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk or that such a possibility should not be permitted to UNK the UNK of the marriage relationship STOP 
START while it is easy enough to UNK UNK UNK in UNK of the crown from a metaphysical point of view the concept of the UNK of a married couple may reflect an UNK belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage STOP 
START by making UNK in the name of law enforcement into the protection which congress has afforded to the marriage relationship the court today continues in the path UNK by the recent decision in UNK v. united states UNK u.s. UNK where the court held that under the circumstances of that case a wife could be compelled to UNK against her husband over her objection STOP 
START one need not UNK in his belief in UNK law enforcement to insist that there are other things in american life which are also of great importance and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself STOP 
START one of these is the solidarity and the UNK relationship of marriage STOP 
START the UNK opinion UNK UNK that the UNK conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship and that hence the doctrine UNK an UNK into a rule of law STOP 
START i am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed STOP 
START but in any event i submit that the power to UNK belongs to congress not to this court STOP

START UNK f. UNK UNK STOP 
START we granted UNK in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the act STOP 
START UNK u. s. UNK STOP 
START we have concluded that UNK claims are controlled by the UNK of UNK v. united states UNK u.s. UNK 1955 and united states v. UNK UNK u.s. 1 1953 and therefore affirm the judgment STOP 
START petitioner registered with local board no. 9 UNK colorado on march 17 1952 STOP 
START his answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of UNK witnesses employed at night by a sugar producer STOP 
START he claimed UNK classification as a minister of religion UNK a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching STOP 
START on november 13 1952 he was classified in class UNK STOP 
START on november 22 1952 he wrote the board UNK this classification STOP 
START he again stated that he was a regular minister he was UNK an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other UNK duties and that he opposed war in any form STOP 
START thereafter he was classified UNK STOP 
START on april 1 1953 after some six months of full-time UNK petitioner UNK UNK 100 hours a month to preaching but failed to so UNK his local board STOP 
START in a UNK review the local board on july 30 1953 UNK him UNK and UNK this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home STOP 
START upon administrative approval of the UNK he was ordered to report for UNK on june 11 1956 but failed to do so STOP 
START he was not UNK however and his case was subsequently UNK in the light of UNK v. united states UNK u.s. UNK 1955 STOP 
START he was again UNK UNK by the local board STOP 
START there followed a customary department of justice hearing at which petitioner appeared STOP 
START in his report to the attorney general the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be UNK only from UNK training and service STOP 
START on march 21 1957 however the department recommended approval of the UNK classification STOP 
START its ground for this recommendation was that while petitioner claimed before the local board august 17 1956 as evidenced by its UNK in his file of that date that he was UNK 100 hours per month to actual preaching the headquarters of the UNK witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and on the contrary had UNK both his pioneer and bible student servant positions STOP 
START it reported that he now devoted only some UNK hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities STOP 
START his claim was therefore so highly exaggerated the department concluded that it cast doubt upon his UNK and consequently upon his sincerity and good faith STOP 
START the appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation STOP 
START in his answer thereto he advised the board that he had made no such statement in 1956 and asserted that his only claim to UNK was in 1952 STOP 
START the appeal board however unanimously UNK in the department's recommendation STOP 
START upon return of the file to the local board petitioner was again ordered to report for UNK and this UNK followed his failure to do so STOP 
START petitioner first UNK that the department denied him UNK due process by not giving him UNK opportunity before its final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of UNK 100 hours to actual preaching STOP 
START but the statement of the local board UNK this claim to petitioner was in his file STOP 
START he admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times and he could have UNK it before the hearing officer STOP 
START this he failed to do UNK that he did not know it to be in his file STOP 
START apparently he never took the trouble to find out STOP 
START nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board STOP 
START after the recommendation of the department is UNK to the appeal board that is the appropriate place for a UNK to lodge his denial STOP 
START this he did STOP 
START we found in UNK v. united states UNK that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a UNK STOP 
START we said there that it was necessary that a UNK be given an opportunity to UNK the department's recommendation when it comes to the appeal board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification STOP 
START UNK u.s. at UNK STOP 
START we fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to UNK UNK which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it STOP 
START as was said in UNK it is the appeal board which UNK the selective service determination considered final in the courts not to be UNK unless there is no basis in fact STOP 
START UNK v. united states UNK u.s. UNK STOP 
START UNK u. s. at UNK STOP 
START but there are other UNK which might be considered more difficult STOP 
START at his trial petitioner sought to secure through UNK UNK UNK the UNK notes of the department's hearing officer UNK as well as his report UNK STOP 
START petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original federal bureau of investigation reports to the department of justice STOP 
START he UNK no specific UNK errors or evidence UNK did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation reports might UNK STOP 
START section UNK of the act as we have held does require the department's recommendation to be placed in a UNK file STOP 
START UNK v. united states UNK STOP 
START but there is nothing in the act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the UNK STOP 
START while the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the UNK file this requirement was eliminated in 1952 STOP 
START moreover the hearing officer's report is but UNK is directed to the attorney general and of course is not the recommendation of the department STOP 
START it is not essentially different from a UNK of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receives many and to which he may give his approval or rejection STOP 
START it is but part of the whole process within the department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board STOP 
START it is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board STOP 
START hence the petitioner had full opportunity to UNK the only conclusions of the department on file with the board STOP 
START petitioner knew that the department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file STOP 
START having had every opportunity to UNK the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed STOP 
START it appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial STOP 
START in addition petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes STOP 
START while there are now UNK of the UNK of favorable evidence developed at the hearing and a denial of a full and fair hearing no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process STOP 
START moreover his testimony at trial never developed any such facts STOP 
START in the light of these circumstances as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the department's recommendation which petitioner UNK but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record we find no UNK in the hearing officer's report and notes STOP 
START finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the UNK report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial STOP 
START he did receive a resume of it the same that was furnished the appeal board and he made no claim of its UNK STOP 
START even now no such claim is asserted STOP 
START he bases his present UNK on the general right to explore indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume STOP 
START but this is fully answered by united states v. UNK UNK STOP 
START there we held that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system UNK UNK UNK to no UNK that the UNK reports must be produced for their inspection STOP 
START UNK u.s. at UNK STOP 
START even if we were not bound by UNK petitioner here would not be entitled to the report STOP 
START the recommendation of the department as well as the decision of the appeal board was based entirely on the local board file not on an UNK report STOP

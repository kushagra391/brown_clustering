START from its UNK in 1920 with the passage of public law UNK UNK congress the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the states by means of UNK to return UNK men and women to productive UNK employment STOP 
START the authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as title 5 of the social security act in UNK STOP 
START up to this time and for the next eight years the services provided UNK persons consisted mainly of training UNK and placement on a job STOP 
START UNK the limitations of such a program the UNK congress in 1943 passed p. l. UNK which UNK the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce UNK and which revised the financing structure STOP 
START recent changes STOP 
START UNK the successful rehabilitation of over a half million UNK persons in the first eleven years after 1943 the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's UNK of an estimated two million UNK STOP 
START to assist the states therefore in UNK handicapped individuals so that they may prepare for and engage in UNK employment to the extent of their capabilities the UNK congress enacted the vocational rehabilitation UNK of 1954 p. l. UNK STOP 
START these UNK to the vocational rehabilitation act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities for more UNK and UNK UNK for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel for more comprehensive services to individuals particularly to the UNK and the blind and for other administrative improvements to increase the UNK overall effectiveness STOP 
START financial aspects STOP 
START UNK the law as it existed until 1943 the federal government made grants to the states on the basis of population matching state expenditures on a UNK basis STOP 
START under p. l. UNK UNK congress the federal government assumed responsibility for UNK of necessary state expenditures in connection with administration and the UNK and placement of the UNK and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing UNK with rehabilitation case services STOP 
START throughout these years the statutory UNK was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the act STOP 
START the 1954 UNK completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program providing for a UNK grant structure for 1 basic support 2 extension and improvement 3 research UNK training and UNK for vocational rehabilitation and in addition for short-term training and instruction STOP 
START the first part of the new structure that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services is described in this section STOP 
START subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure STOP 
START the following table shows for selected years the UNK UNK allotment base federal grants to states and state matching funds for this part of the grant program method of UNK funds description of formula STOP 
START -hlin order to assist the states in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services section 2 of the amended act provides that UNK to states for support of such services be based on 1 need as measured by a state's population and 2 fiscal capacity as measured by its per capita income STOP 
START the act further provides for a floor or minimum allotment set at the 1954 level which is called the base allotment and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each state STOP 
START it UNK in addition that all amounts remaining as a result of UNK the ceiling and not used for UNK the floor be UNK to those states still below their UNK STOP 
START these provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the states with the objective that a UNK handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he UNK in a state with a low or high per capita income or a UNK or UNK populated state STOP 
START the provisions are also designed to avoid UNK in state programs already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone STOP 
START method of computing UNK STOP 
START -hlthe method used in computing the UNK is specifically set forth in the act STOP 
START the term state means the several states the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico term united states includes the several states and the district of columbia and UNK the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii STOP 
START the following steps are employed in UNK 1 STOP 
START UNK each state except puerto rico guam the virgin islands and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii determine average per capita income based on the last three years STOP

START 4 STOP 
START -hldetermine for each state except the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular state's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the u. s. STOP 
START UNK the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each state in item 1 above STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START -hldetermine the particular state's allotment percentage STOP 
START by law this is UNK for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico STOP 
START alaska and hawaii had fixed allotment UNK in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 STOP 
START in all other states it is the difference obtained by UNK from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above that no state shall have an allotment percentage less than UNK nor more than UNK STOP 
START if the resulting difference for the particular state is less or more than these UNK the state's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START UNK each state's allotment percentage STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START determine each state's population STOP 
START see source of data below for population data to be used in this step STOP 
START 8 STOP 
START UNK the population of each state by the square of its allotment percentage STOP 
START UNK result obtained in item 7 above by result obtained in item 6 above STOP 
START 9 STOP 
START -hldetermine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above for all the states STOP 
START for each state make all UNK set forth in items 1 to 8 above and then add the results obtained for each state in item 8 STOP 
START 10 STOP 
START -hldetermine the ratio that the amount being UNK is to the sum of the products for all the states STOP 
START divide the amount being UNK by the result obtained in item 9 above STOP 
START 11 STOP 
START -hldetermine the particular state's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year STOP 
START UNK the state product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above STOP 
START 12 STOP 
START -hldetermine if the particular state's unadjusted allotment result obtained in item 11 above is greater than its maximum allotment and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment STOP 
START each state's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which UNK its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and UNK times the percentage by which the sum being UNK UNK UNK must be reduced by the amount of the excess STOP 
START 13 STOP 
START -hldetermine if the particular state's unadjusted allotment result obtained in item 11 above is less than its minimum base allotment and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment STOP 
START regardless of its unadjusted allotment each state is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 increased by a uniform percentage of UNK which brings total 1954 UNK to all states up to UNK STOP 
START 14 STOP 
START -hlthe funds UNK by UNK in item 12 above are used first to increase the unadjusted UNK to the specified minimum in those states where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment item 13 above second to increase UNK the UNK to those states whose UNK are below their UNK with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby UNK its maximum STOP 
START additional note on UNK STOP 
START UNK the states which maintain two separate agencies one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind the act UNK that their minimum base allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 STOP 
START funds UNK in addition to their minimum allotment are UNK to the two agencies as they may determine STOP 
START matching requirements explanation of matching formula STOP 
START UNK is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula STOP 
START prior to 1960 in order to provide matching for the minimum base allotment state funds had to equal 1954 state funds STOP 
START prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the state with a UNK of UNK state or UNK federal participation in total program costs STOP 
START the percentage of federal participation in such costs for any state is referred to in the law as that state's federal share STOP 
START for purposes of this explanation this percentage is referred to as the state's unadjusted federal share STOP 
START beginning in 1960 the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted upward or downward as required UNK a year so that by UNK the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a UNK UNK state share with maximum and minimum state shares of 50% and UNK respectively STOP 
START the UNK rate of federal participation with respect to any state's base allotment as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 1962 period is designated by the statute as that state's adjusted federal share STOP 
START the provisions for determining a state's unadjusted federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the states STOP 
START the purpose of the adjusted federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted federal share is to prevent UNK from abrupt changes in matching rates STOP 
START method of computing federal shares STOP 
START -hlthe method used for computing the respective federal and state shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the act STOP 
START the term state means the several states the district of columbia the virgin islands guam and puerto rico term united states includes the several states and the district of columbia and UNK the virgin islands guam and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii STOP 
START the following steps are employed in the UNK 1 STOP 
START UNK each state except the virgin islands guam puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii determine the average per capita income for the last three years STOP 
START the same amount used in item 1 under method of computing UNK above STOP

START 4 STOP 
START -hldetermine for each state except the virgin islands guam puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii that percentage which bears the same UNK to UNK as the particular state's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the united states STOP 
START UNK the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each state in item 1 above STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START -hldetermine the particular state's federal share STOP 
START by law this is UNK for the virgin islands guam and puerto rico STOP 
START alaska and hawaii had fixed federal share UNK in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 STOP 
START in all other states it is the difference obtained by UNK from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above that no state shall have a federal share less than 50% nor more than UNK STOP 
START if the resulting difference for the particular state is less or more than these UNK the state's federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme STOP

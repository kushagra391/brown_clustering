START so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have UNK assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse expressing a UNK at a single stage of development STOP 
START for critics hardy has had no poetic periods one does not speak of early hardy or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply of hardy as of a poetic UNK STOP 
START this seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major english poet UNK is dated between UNK and UNK seeing the moon rise is dated august 1927 STOP 
START one might expect that in a poetic career of UNK years some changes in style and method would have occurred some development taken place STOP 
START this is not however the case and development is a term which we can apply to hardy only in a very limited sense STOP 
START in a time when poetic style and poetic belief as well seem in a state of UNK flux hardy stands out as a poet of almost UNK consistency STOP 
START though he UNK with philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the UNK of his UNK sober opinion of his letter to UNK written when hardy was eighty years old is essentially that of his first philosophical UNK entry made when he was twenty-five the world does not UNK us it only UNK us early life p. UNK STOP 
START and though in his later years he revised his poems many times the UNK did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty that while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one STOP 
START there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about hardy's development he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as UNK his STOP 
START there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style is only UNK evident and when it is not the style is the style of another poet or of the fashion of the time STOP 
START in the later poems however the personal tone UNK STOP 
START the bad early poems are bad shakespeare or bad UNK bad late poems are bad hardy STOP 
START there are two ways of getting at a poet's development through his dated poems and through the UNK which he made in later UNK of his work STOP 
START about a quarter of hardy's poems carry an UNK date line usually the year of completion but sometimes UNK years UNK 1910 or two separate dates when hardy worked on the poem UNK and UNK or an approximate date during the war STOP 
START these dates are virtually the only UNK we have to the UNK of the poems since the separate volumes are neither UNK within themselves nor in relation to each other STOP 
START with the exception of UNK of circumstance each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades winter words UNK UNK years internal organization rarely has any UNK order except in obvious groups like the poems of UNK the poems of 1912 13 and the war poems STOP 
START from the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about hardy's career in poetry always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative STOP 
START the dated poems suggest that while hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant his production was not STOP 
START he had two productive periods one in the late UNK the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 half of the dated poems are from the latter period and these alone total about UNK of all hardy's poems STOP 
START there was one UNK period only one poem is dated between UNK and UNK and except for the poems written on the trip to italy in UNK very few from UNK to UNK STOP 
START the dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past UNK for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time STOP 
START poems of the past and the present and UNK laughing stocks both published while hardy was at work on the UNK draw heavily on poems written before 1900 STOP 
START UNK of circumstance and moments of vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively UNK former contains no poem dated before UNK 10 that is no poem from a period covered by a previous volume and the latter has only a few such STOP 
START the last three volumes are again more dependent on the past as hardy's creative powers declined in his old age STOP 
START these observations about hardy's productivity UNK with the details of his life as we know them STOP 
START the first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a UNK before he had decided to write fiction for a living in his note for who's who he wrote that he wrote UNK UNK UNK up verse for prose UNK 70 resumed it later STOP 
START during the UNK UNK years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was in addition UNK with bad health he spent six months in bed in UNK too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at a UNK STOP 
START two entries in the early life support the assumption that during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry STOP 
START mrs. hardy records that at the end of november UNK he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible early life p. UNK on christmas day UNK hardy wrote while thinking of UNK the UNK wings of UNK before dawn this morning new UNK seemed to open and UNK UNK to disappear early life p. UNK STOP 
START there are more poems dated in the UNK than in the UNK hardy had apparently resumed the UNK wings as he UNK the volume of his fiction but none in UNK the year of UNK and only one in UNK the year of UNK STOP 
START after UNK the number increases and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem UNK when hardy was at work on the UNK STOP 
START the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can be related to three events the completion of the UNK in UNK which left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years death of UNK hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional effect on hardy for which he found release in poetry the first world war STOP 
START it may seem strange that a poet should come to full UNK in his UNK but we have it on hardy's own authority that he was a child till he was sixteen a youth till he was UNK and a young man till he was nearly fifty early life p. 42 STOP 
START we may carry this sequence one step further and say that at UNK he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only the UNK of two UNK one personal the other national to loose those powers in poetry STOP 
START hardy's two productive decades were separated by forty years yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself it was a UNK not an expanding process STOP 
START like a wise UNK hardy UNK away the UNK UNK and songs and the elements of UNK and poetic UNK to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock of his talent UNK STOP 
START the range of the later poetry is considerably UNK but the number of successful poems is far greater STOP 
START we can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities UNK UNK and neutral tones UNK STOP 
START there is not much to be said for UNK STOP 
START like about half of the UNK 70 poems it is a UNK on a conventional theme the UNK of love STOP 
START almost anyone could have written it is competent in the sense that it makes a UNK statement without UNK the rules of the UNK form but it is entirely UNK and entirely unlike hardy STOP 
START the language is the conventional language of the form is no phrase or image that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give UNK to the poem STOP 
START it is UNK than hardy usually is but with the UNK of UNK STOP 
START it is obviously a young man's poem written out of books and not out of experience UNK emotion without UNK it that is to say it is sentimental STOP 
START there are many such UNK anonymous performances among the earlier poems STOP 
START neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in hardy's most characteristic style the plain but not quite UNK language the hard particular UNK images the slightly odd UNK the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to resolve the issue all these we have seen in hardy's best poems STOP 
START the poem does not UNK the UNK of ordinary speech nor draw on UNK sources of UNK yet it is obviously not ordinary speech only hardy would say a grin of bitterness swept thereby an ominous bird UNK or UNK with wrong or would describe a winter sun as UNK STOP 
START the details of the setting of neutral tones are not strictly speaking UNK but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a UNK winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the emotions and the elements UNK each other in a way that is common to many of hardy's best poems UNK the UNK UNK and during wind and rain for example and to some moving passages in the novels as well far from the UNK crowd is full of scenes constructed in this way STOP 
START neutral tones is an excellent example of hardy's mature style drawn from his earliest productive period UNK it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older as UNK did but that he simply learned to use better what he already had STOP 
START in the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world it is UNK it is also precise and the precision UNK authority to the vision STOP 
START in UNK on the other hand the UNK is a case not proven poem offers nothing to persuade us of the UNK right to speak as he does STOP 
START in the UNK 70 decade there are many poems like UNK but there is only one neutral tones STOP 
START hardy was not hardy very often STOP 
START the poems of 1912 13 offer a good example of hardy's style as it was UNK in the later productive decade STOP 
START these are the poems hardy wrote after the death of his first wife UNK a painful UNK to what might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness and ended in long years of suffering and hatred STOP 
START hardy obviously felt that these poems were UNK personal and private sometimes called them an UNK and he would not allow them to be published in UNK STOP 
START they are the only poems that he UNK as a group between their first appearance in UNK of circumstance and the publication of the collected poems STOP 
START the UNK tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising that the 1912 13 poems are consistently and UNK his STOP 
START the view is always toward the past the mood is not quite UNK hardy would not allow sentiment to UNK his sense of the UNK UNK of the past and the eternal UNK of the dead STOP 
START the poems are the UNK tells us the UNK of an ancient flame fire of love is dead and hardy stands as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence over the UNK circle of UNK sticks and thinks of past happiness and present UNK honest and UNK STOP

START for a neutral germany soviets said to fear UNK of german UNK to the editor of the new york times for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large powerful nations armed with UNK nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a UNK STOP 
START the united states and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations STOP 
START recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly UNK should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations STOP 
START president kennedy was right when he said we shall never UNK out of fear and we never shall fear to UNK STOP 
START i have just returned from a UNK trip to europe and the far east STOP 
START it is quite evident that the people of western europe are UNK opposed to participation in a nuclear war STOP 
START the fact is that the UNK french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs STOP 
START we have no right to UNK them as they realize they would be sitting UNK in a nuclear war STOP 
START we should stand firmly and UNK for our right to free access into berlin STOP 
START it would be criminal UNK if the communists tried to prevent us STOP 
START but there is nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from UNK de UNK recognition to east germany STOP 
START soviet russia has been UNK twice by german troops in a generation STOP 
START in the last war russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were UNK STOP 
START probable agreement the truth is that communist russia fears the UNK of german UNK STOP 
START berlin is merely being used by moscow as a UNK horse STOP 
START actually the communists out of fear of a united and armed germany would probably be willing to agree to a UNK germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the u.n. STOP 
START if the communists are sincere in wanting a united neutral and UNK germany it might well be UNK for the german people in this nuclear age STOP 
START it could provide security without cost of UNK and increase german prosperity and UNK taxation STOP 
START france and other western european nations likewise fear a UNK germany STOP 
START if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany following the example of UNK STOP 
START president kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called operation survival which has many UNK STOP 
START why not make a beginning with a united and UNK germany whose UNK and UNK from nuclear UNK would be guaranteed by the big four powers and the united states united germany freed of UNK might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a UNK and UNK world STOP 
START meeting u.n. obligations to the editor of the new york times in your editorial of sept. 30 the UNK congo you make the following comment far too many states are following the russian example in UNK to pay their UNK STOP 
START it is up to the assembly to take action against them STOP 
START they are UNK their charter obligation the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or UNK STOP 
START i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations article 17 section 1 general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization STOP 
START section 2 expenses of the organization shall be UNK by the members as UNK by the general assembly STOP 
START article 19 member of the united nations which is in UNK in the payment of its financial contributions to the organization shall have no vote in the general assembly if the amount of its UNK UNK or UNK the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years STOP 
START the UNK and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget STOP 
START but they refuse as do the UNK states to support the united UNK expenses of maintaining the united nations emergency force in the middle east as a buffer between egypt and israel and the u.n. troops in the congo which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the united nations but by a special budget STOP 
START according to the official interpretation of the charter a member cannot be UNK by not having the right to vote in the general assembly for UNK of financial obligations to the special united UNK UNK and of course cannot be UNK from the organization which you suggested in your editorial due to the fact that there is no provision in the charter for UNK STOP

START yet your list of things left UNK did not include UNK of the UNK amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction UNK to its UNK to the statute of the international court of justice STOP 
START the UNK amendment says that the united states rather than the court shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the united states in a case before the world court to which the united states is a party STOP 
START if the case is thus determined by us to be domestic the court has no jurisdiction STOP 
START since the UNK amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the united states it also UNK us from using the court effectively STOP 
START yet although the kennedy administration and the eisenhower administration before it have both declared themselves UNK for UNK of the UNK amendment as contrary to our best interests no action has yet been taken STOP 
START our destiny in these UNK times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace with justice under law STOP 
START to achieve this destiny acts as well as words are needed not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect STOP 
START what better UNK step could be taken to this end than UNK of the UNK amendment an act which could UNK the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our UNK attitude toward the court enable us to UNK it and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order believe that the list of vital things left UNK to date by the UNK congress should have included UNK by the senate of the UNK amendment STOP 
START for better UNK services to the editor of the new york times many UNK UNK riders UNK the UNK street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local UNK from the UNK station as their express comes to a stop leaving them UNK and strained STOP 
START to the UNK of thousands who must transfer to ride to UNK street and change for the UNK this takes a daily toll of time and temper STOP 
START the transit authority has recently placed in operation hold lights at UNK UNK and UNK street stations in brooklyn STOP 
START this holds the local until the express passengers change trains STOP 
START without question this time and temper UNK should be immediately installed at the UNK station STOP 
START phone service criticized to the editor of the new york times as a business man i have to use the telephone constantly from three to four hours a day STOP 
START in the last few years the telephone company has managed to UNK many areas of their service STOP

START however there are still several types of calls that UNK the use of telephone operators STOP 
START i have been absolutely shocked at the UNK of the young ladies who are UNK UNK calls special UNK calls etc. STOP

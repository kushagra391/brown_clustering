START at one time to most americans unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of UNK water boats were considered the sole concern of UNK rich people and the united states navy STOP 
START today the UNK boating scene is UNK with UNK statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport STOP 
START there are more than UNK UNK boats in use in the united states with almost UNK the UNK for within the next decade STOP 
START about UNK people participated in boating in 1960 STOP 
START boating has become a giant whose UNK cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea STOP 
START boats are operated in every state in the union with the UNK UNK along both UNK and in the middle west STOP 
START the spectacular UNK in pleasure boating is UNK evident UNK in the areas where boats have always been found the natural UNK rivers and along the nation's UNK STOP 
START but during the last several years boats were launched in areas where a short time ago the only water to be found was in wells and UNK UNK for livestock STOP 
START developed as a result of the UNK resources control program of the government vast UNK bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit providing boating and fishing UNK all over the country STOP 
START no matter how determined or wealthy boating UNK of the southwest had been for example they could never have created anything approaching the fifty UNK lake UNK located between texas and oklahoma which resulted when the UNK of army engineers UNK the red river STOP 
START in 1959 according to the engineers lake UNK was only one of UNK artificial UNK and UNK which were used for recreation by over UNK persons STOP 
START where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water STOP 
START providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated UNK boat trailers now in use STOP 
START it is a simple task to UNK a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or UNK on the new light strong UNK trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to UNK STOP 
START the sight of UNK UNK UNK and UNK being UNK UNK along highways many miles from any water is commonplace STOP 
START UNK lucky enough to have facilities for UNK UNK for their craft will recall the UNK procedure of loading their gear into the car driving to the water and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat STOP 
START today the boat on its trailer is brought to the gear and loaded at the door STOP 
START arriving at the UNK the boat is launched the family taken aboard and that easily another day UNK is begun STOP 
START and trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago STOP 
START this year americans will discover previously UNK of UNK in trailers that will be UNK in about one hundred of our nation's national regional and local boat shows STOP 
START the boats of america's trailer UNK in 1961 will be UNK on clouds as they are UNK to new UNK STOP 
START the variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming STOP 
START they range from an UNK UNK which you can build yourself for less than UNK to UNK UNK which can cost over UNK STOP 
START boat prices vary according to the UNK desires or needs STOP 
START in this respect boats can be compared with houses STOP 
START there is no limit to what you can spend yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget STOP 
START there is no question as to just what is available STOP 
START you name it our industry is producing it and it probably is made in different models STOP 
START there are UNK ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips STOP 
START there are UNK which are literally homes UNK UNK whole families in comfort and convenience STOP 
START you can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft sail power or both or UNK away a fine day in a small UNK on a local pond STOP 
START you may have your boat of wood canvas UNK plastic or metal STOP 
START you may order utility models UNK or UNK with or without UNK UNK and bunks STOP 
START you may dress it up with any number of UNK or keep it as simple as you choose STOP 
START designers and manufacturers have produced models for UNK who run the UNK from a UNK version of the elderly UNK lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her UNK ride around the block to the UNK UNK who UNK on all the dash color UNK and speed possible to UNK in a single boat STOP 
START you pay your money and you take your choice STOP 
START american technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the UNK interest in american boating STOP 
START i wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors americans UNK over any country in the world in the long run STOP 
START russia whose technology is not quite primitive is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the UNK motor for instance STOP 
START now here is truly a UNK STOP 
START the UNK engine of today has a UNK range of one to 80 UNK UNK of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production STOP 
START these engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease UNK lies their greatest advantage STOP 
START their cost is not beyond the hopes of the american UNK the range being about UNK to $1,000 depending on size STOP 
START great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country to making the UNK of a boat simpler STOP 
START there was a time when if a man wanted to purchase a boat it was necessary for him to be able to produce a UNK amount of cash before he could touch the UNK or wheel STOP 
START having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended STOP 
START marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in UNK areas cooperate in enabling you to UNK now and pay later STOP 
START terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles STOP 
START of course individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the UNK UNK power credit UNK and local bank policy STOP 
START UNK motors insurance and boat UNK may also be financed in the same way as boats STOP 
START terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home UNK STOP 
START when the automobile was in its UNK stage such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the UNK understanding that horses should not be UNK UNK being about the only rule governing where when and how fast a car could go STOP 
START when air travel was in its infancy the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all STOP 
START man had enough to worry about UNK to get up there and stay without being UNK with rules once UNK STOP 
START it was much the same with pleasure boating at first STOP 
START come one come all the UNK fine the UNK days of the automobile and the airplane are long since UNK to the past so is the UNK attitude toward what a UNK may and may not do and should do STOP 
START however there is a minimum of legislative UNK on boating STOP 
START laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its UNK STOP 
START what may be acceptable in one state may be strictly UNK across the boundary line STOP 
START the main requirement is to be sure the boat is UNK according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be UNK used STOP 
START if your state has no provisions for the UNK of pleasure boats you must apply for a number from the u.s. coast guard for any kind of boat with mechanical UNK UNK at more than 10 UNK before it can be used on federal UNK STOP 
START state UNK laws differ from each other in many ways STOP 
START fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft such as UNK with no power to be registered at all STOP 
START many states have laws UNK the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators STOP 
START generally states reserve for communities the right to have local UNK UNK speed and other activities STOP 
START it is always wise to consult your marine dealer local UNK or boat club secretary or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are STOP 
START ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy STOP 
START hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program STOP 
START UNK the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport the industry has been supporting an intense coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 STOP 
START a primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers STOP 
START the industry has been its own watch dog STOP 
START with u.s. coast guard cooperation the american boat and UNK council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety STOP 
START industry interest in safety goes even farther STOP 
START in 1959 the UNK safety bureau was UNK by the national association of engine and boat manufacturers and a group of insurance UNK to provide a testing laboratory and UNK service for boats and their equipment STOP 
START a new UNK site for the bureau is now being built at atlantic city new jersey to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe STOP 
START in addition to these activities the UNK with headquarters at UNK UNK avenue new york city as well as other associations and individual manufacturers provide and UNK films UNK and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety UNK STOP 
START it is important to note the work of the united states power UNK and the u.s. coast guard UNK STOP 
START each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in UNK UNK and small boat handling STOP 
START these are not UNK UNK organizations STOP 
START this year over UNK persons will receive this free instruction STOP 
START as america on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts UNK and UNK UNK where you can UNK see a movie shop or make a bank UNK the UNK number of boating UNK have UNK industries designed especially to accommodate them STOP 
START instead of UNK for the UNK there are UNK STOP 
START the word UNK was UNK by UNK originally to describe a UNK facility where UNK boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort STOP 
START currently UNK is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may UNK and find some or all of the following available gasoline fresh water electricity telephone service ice repair facilities restaurants sleeping UNK a general store and a UNK store STOP 
START UNK a relatively new word indicates a UNK type of hotel where a UNK may UNK and find overnight UNK on the UNK as well as other services STOP 
START UNK has a similar meaning to UNK STOP 
START it indicates the same thing but it is meant to UNK more specifically to UNK designed to UNK to smaller type boats such as UNK STOP 
START regardless of UNK UNK and UNK are UNK STOP 
START UNK which also provide some of the above facilities may UNK be called UNK STOP 
START a recent survey disclosed there are about UNK commercially and UNK operated UNK and UNK in the united states the majority of which are equipped to handle UNK boats STOP

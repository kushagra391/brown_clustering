START suddenly however their posture changed and the game ended STOP 
START they went as rigid as black UNK six figures lean and tall and angular went still STOP 
START their heads were in the air UNK STOP 
START they all swung at the same instant in the same direction STOP 
START they saw it before i did even with my UNK STOP 
START it was nothing more than a tiny distant rain UNK a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth STOP 
START in the UNK degrees of horizon it UNK only a degree no more STOP 
START a white man would not have seen it STOP 
START the UNK fastened upon it with a concentration beyond UNK STOP 
START watching they waited until the UNK UNK and began to move in a long drifting UNK across the dry burning land STOP 
START at once the whole band set off at a UNK STOP 
START they were UNK a rain cloud STOP 
START they went after the UNK as UNK as a UNK pack after an abandoned cow STOP 
START i followed them in the jeep and now they did not care STOP 
START the games were over this was life STOP 
START occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot STOP 
START sometimes i guessed it was because the rain UNK had changed direction STOP 
START sometimes it was to skirt a UNK STOP 
START their UNK is impossible to convey in words STOP 
START it has nothing of the proud stride of the trained UNK about it it is not a UNK it is not done with style or UNK STOP 
START it is the UNK of the human who must run to live arms UNK legs barely swinging over the ground head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target a loose motion that is just short of UNK and yet is wonderfully UNK STOP 
START it is a barely controlled UNK of the ground STOP 
START they ran for three hours STOP 
START finally avoiding UNK and seeking low ground they UNK the rain UNK STOP 
START for ten minutes they ran beneath the UNK raising their arms and for the first time shouting and UNK STOP 
START then the wind died and the rain UNK held steady STOP 
START they were studying the ground STOP 
START suddenly one of them shouted ran a few feet bent forward and put his mouth to the ground STOP 
START he had found a depression with rain water in it STOP 
START he bent down a black UNK figure and put his mouth to the ground STOP 
START with a UNK and generous gesture the UNK stood up and UNK to the UNK of his fellows STOP 
START the other UNK over and UNK at the tiny UNK STOP 
START in an instant he had UNK it dry STOP 
START the UNK lives on the UNK land i have ever seen STOP 
START which does not mean that it is ugly STOP 
START part of it is of course STOP 
START there are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous STOP 
START they are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left but only deep bare UNK fifty or sixty yards apart with UNK between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a UNK layer of sand STOP 
START such UNK have an UNK UNK quality STOP 
START but much of the land which the UNK UNK looks as if it should be UNK STOP 
START it is UNK by the UNK and the UNK has a peaceful quality the hills roll softly STOP 
START the UNK of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the UNK charles UNK STOP 
START he tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single UNK a UNK square owned by a sheep UNK STOP 
START they went UNK with everything except knowledge of the UNK country STOP 
START the UNK looked like a beautiful open park with gentle UNK and soft gray UNK STOP 
START nothing UNK or horrible rushed upon these men STOP 
START only there happened nothing STOP 
START there might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these UNK only there was not STOP 
START it might have UNK any time it did not STOP 
START there might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise there was not STOP 
START they lay with the birds UNK from branch to branch above them and the bright sky UNK down at them STOP 
START no one came STOP 
START the white men died STOP 
START and countless others like them have died STOP 
START even today range riders will come upon UNK bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a UNK UNK and slowly lost direction were UNK by the heat driven mad by the constant and UNK promise of the landscape and who finally died STOP 
START the UNK is not UNK knows that the land is hard and UNK STOP 
START he knows that the economy of life in the UNK is awful STOP 
START there is no room for error or waste STOP 
START any UNK that UNK or UNK the signals or UNK is done STOP 
START i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a UNK challenge but i suspect that it can STOP 
START perhaps this is what gives the UNK his odd air of dignity STOP 
START the family at the UNK seeing an UNK today is a difficult thing STOP 
START many of them have UNK into the cities and towns and UNK STOP 
START others are confined to vast UNK and not only does the UNK government UNK not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a UNK but on their UNK they are extremely UNK UNK camps coming together only for UNK at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch which is very low indeed STOP 
START i persuaded an UNK friend who had lived UNK for years to take me to see some UNK living in the bush STOP 
START it was a difficult and ambiguous kind of UNK even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the UNK and their language STOP 
START finally however the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a land UNK STOP 
START we followed the UNK road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth STOP 
START the rancher went a mile down this road and then when he reached a big red UNK swung off the road STOP 
START at once he started to glance toward the instrument panel STOP 
START it took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel there was a UNK compass UNK to it which UNK gently back and forth as the land UNK bounced about STOP 
START the rancher was UNK his way across the UNK STOP 
START do you always UNK like this asked STOP 
START damned right he said STOP 
START once i get out on the flat i do STOP 
START some UNK that know an area well can make their way by UNK a tree here a wash here a UNK there STOP 
START but if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand you'd better use a compass and the UNK STOP 
START two miles northeast then five miles southwest that sort of thing STOP 
START very simple STOP 
START he was right STOP 
START the landscape kept UNK itself STOP 
START i would try to UNK UNK and saw in a UNK that it was hopeless STOP 
START finally we approached the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START they were UNK beside a large UNK UNK a man his UNK and two children STOP 
START the sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the UNK STOP 
START there was also a dog a UNK dog STOP 
START its ribs showed it was a yellow UNK color it suffered from a variety of UNK hair had UNK off its body in UNK STOP 
START it lay with its head on its UNK and only its eyes moving watching us carefully STOP 
START it struck me as a very bright and very UNK dog STOP 
START no one UNK the dog STOP 
START it was not a UNK STOP 
START it was a worker STOP 
START the UNK love shade the rancher said STOP 
START i suppose because it UNK them some loss of body water STOP 
START they'll move around that rock all day following the shade STOP 
START during the UNK part of the day of course the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade STOP 
START we drove close to the UNK stopped the land UNK and walked over toward the family STOP 
START the man was leaning against the rock STOP 
START he UNK away from us as we approached STOP 
START he was over six feet tall and very thin STOP 
START his legs were narrow and very long STOP 
START every bone and muscle in his body showed but he did not give the appearance of UNK STOP 
START he had long black hair and a UNK beard STOP 
START the UNK over his eyes were huge and his UNK were half shut STOP 
START there was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what STOP 
START it was not merely that flies were UNK over his face but his UNK UNK did not UNK when the flies crawled into his eye UNK STOP 
START a fly would crawl down the UNK forehead into the UNK of the eye walk along the man's UNK and across the wet surface of the UNK and the eye did not UNK STOP 
START the UNK and i both were wearing insect UNK and were not badly bothered by insects but my eyes UNK as we stood watching the UNK STOP 
START i turned to look at the UNK STOP 
START she remained UNK on her heels all the time we were there the man she was entirely naked STOP 
START her long thin arms moved in a slow UNK gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her STOP 
START there were two rubbing sticks for making fire two stones shaped roughly like UNK a UNK UNK which held a few pounds of dried UNK and the dead body of some UNK STOP 
START there was also a long wooden UNK and a UNK a UNK device which gives the UNK an enormous velocity and high accuracy STOP 
START there was also a UNK UNK carved STOP 
START everything was UNK with sweat and UNK so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be UNK STOP 
START the two children both boys UNK around the UNK and me for a few moments and then returned to their work STOP 
START they UNK on their heels with their heads bent far forward their eyes only a few inches from the ground STOP 
START they had located the UNK of a colony of UNK and as the UNK came out of the ground the boys picked them up one at a time and UNK them dead STOP 
START the tiny bodies dropped onto a dry leaf made a pile as big as a small UNK STOP 
START the odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town UNK STOP 
START the smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant STOP 
START it was also UNK familiar for it was the odor of the human body but UNK UNK times because of the fact that the UNK never UNK STOP 
START one's impulse is to say that the smell was a UNK and unpleasant STOP 
START but that is a UNK and a UNK one STOP 
START the smell is sexual but so UNK so that a civilized nose must deny it STOP 
START their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin STOP 
START they roll at night in UNK to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it STOP 
START in spots such as the UNK and knees the second skin is worn off and i realized the UNK were much UNK than they appeared if the coating of sweat dirt and UNK were a UNK STOP 
START the boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and UNK their eyes STOP 
START that smell is something UNK mate UNK asked STOP 
START they UNK that every person UNK different and every family UNK different from every other STOP 
START at the UNK when they get to dancing and UNK you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a UNK good smell STOP 
START UNK here and he nodded at the man is said to have great odor STOP 
START the UNK is all the same to me but i really think they can make one another out UNK STOP 
START here UNK you UNK like UNK said sharply STOP 
START UNK still stared over our shoulders at the horizon STOP 
START the UNK stopped trying to talk a UNK i could understand and spoke strange words from deep in his chest STOP

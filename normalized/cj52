START but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality like red or UNK that could be seen or heard STOP 
START what were they to do then with these awkward judgments of value find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to UNK the theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery STOP 
START it appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only STOP 
START if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but merely expressed emotions like UNK or UNK then these UNK judgments would cease from UNK and weary heads could be at rest STOP 
START this is the course the UNK took STOP 
START they explained value judgments by explaining them away STOP 
START now i do not think their view will do STOP 
START but before discussing it i should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case STOP 
START it has been said of john stuart mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out STOP 
START this theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind and this i will do my best to supply STOP 
START the theory claims to show by analysis that when we say that is good we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking STOP 
START i shall argue that we do mean to do just that STOP 
START let us work through an example and the simpler and UNK the better STOP 
START there is perhaps no value statement on which people would more UNK agree than the statement that intense pain is bad STOP 
START let us take a set of circumstances in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement STOP 
START we come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the UNK UNK in common use STOP 
START there are signs that it has UNK for days to escape and that in a UNK of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten off its own leg STOP 
START the attempt failed the animal is now dead STOP 
START as we think of the long and UNK pain it must have suffered we are very likely to say it was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so STOP 
START the UNK tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion STOP 
START i hold on the contrary that we mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it was bad bad when and as it occurred STOP 
START consider what follows from the UNK view STOP 
START on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case until i came on the scene and made my remark STOP 
START for what i express in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course did not exist until i did come on the scene STOP 
START the pain of the rabbit was not itself bad evil was happening when that pain was being endured in the only sense in which it is involved at all waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt STOP 
START now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows STOP 
START let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered STOP 
START are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did not STOP 
START indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the UNK of the UNK pain that it would have been every UNK as bad whether a chance UNK happened later to discover the body and feel UNK or not STOP 
START if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only STOP 
START we are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it STOP 
START the first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference STOP 
START it UNK our present expression and shows that the UNK we meant would not be affected by this whereas on UNK grounds it should be STOP 
START the second argument applies the method in the reverse way STOP 
START it UNK UNK the past event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say whereas on UNK grounds it should not STOP 
START let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but that we UNK believe it did and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing STOP 
START on the UNK theory everything i sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second STOP 
START in the only sense in which UNK is involved at all whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its UNK since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that feeling is still there STOP 
START and our question is is such an UNK consistent with what we meant it is not STOP 
START if anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were UNK to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to be bad and that our UNK was in that case mistaken STOP 
START the suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering seems to me merely UNK STOP 
START if we did not mean to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred the theory before us such relief would be UNK for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all and hence in its UNK there would be nothing to be relieved about STOP 
START the UNK theory would here UNK our meaning beyond recognition STOP 
START so far as i can see there is only one way out for the UNK STOP 
START he holds that goodness and UNK lie in feelings of approval or disapproval STOP 
START and there is a way in which he might hold that UNK did in this case UNK our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself STOP 
START the pain in itself was neutral unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time and in the only intelligible sense bad STOP 
START this way of escape is UNK possible but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not so far as i know been urged by UNK it is perhaps best not to spend time over it STOP 
START i come now to a third argument which again is very simple STOP 
START when we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably make it with some feeling UNK are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling STOP 
START but suppose that a week later we UNK to the incident in thought and make our statement again STOP 
START and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded STOP 
START the UNK evidence is no longer before us we are now so UNK in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead STOP 
START in these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now UNK nothing STOP 
START it is as empty as the word UNK would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it STOP 
START and this seems to me UNK STOP 
START when we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the UNK point but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we should certainly answer yes STOP 
START we should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time but that it was the same point we were making STOP 
START and if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express STOP 
START i come now to a fourth consideration STOP 
START we all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense STOP 
START broad and ross have lately contended that this UNK is one of the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right STOP 
START but that is not exactly my point STOP 
START my point is this whether there is such UNK or not we all assume that there is and if we do we express in moral judgments more than the UNK say we do STOP 
START let me illustrate STOP 
START in his novel the house of the dead UNK tells of his experiences in a UNK prison camp STOP 
START whatever the unhappy UNK of such camps are like today UNK UNK were about as grim a lot as can be imagined STOP 
START i have heard stories he writes of the most terrible the most UNK actions of the most monstrous murders told with the most spontaneous UNK UNK laughter STOP 
START most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very UNK STOP 
START if we were asked why we thought so we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly UNK STOP 
START now on the UNK view this answer is ruled out STOP 
START for before someone takes up an attitude toward death suffering or their UNK they have no moral quality at all STOP 
START there is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or UNK could be fitting STOP 
START they are in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the UNK STOP 
START but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any other applause for example be fitting if apart from the applause there were nothing good to UNK UNK be fitting if independently of the UNK there were nothing bad to UNK such a case any attitude would be as fitting or UNK as any other which means that the notion of UNK has lost all point STOP 
START indeed we are forced to go much farther STOP 
START if goodness and UNK lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them those men who greeted death and misery with UNK UNK laughter are taking the only sensible line STOP 
START if there is nothing evil in these things if they get their moral UNK only from our feeling about them why shouldn't they be greeted with a UNK UNK them with UNK would turn what before was neutral into something bad would UNK bring UNK into the world even on UNK assumptions that does not seem very bright STOP 
START on the other hand to UNK them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good would bring goodness into the world STOP

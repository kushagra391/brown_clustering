START we often say of a person that he looks young for his age or old for his age STOP 
START yet even in the more extreme of such cases we seldom go very far UNK in UNK what his age actually is STOP 
START and this means i suppose that almost invariably age reveals itself by easily UNK signs UNK on both the body and the mind STOP 
START young for his age means only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual STOP 
START UNK quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless there STOP 
START an assumption of youth or the presence of a few youthful characteristics UNK no more successfully than UNK or UNK hair STOP 
START looking young for your age means for your age and it means no more STOP 
START a mind expressing itself in words may reveal itself a little less obviously as old or young STOP 
START its surface loses its bloom and UNK to its UNK in ways less immediately obvious than the body does STOP 
START youth may be and often is UNK UNK or UNK may be UNK believing and much given to UNK of optimism STOP 
START but there is nevertheless always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held STOP 
START the UNK of the young is UNK anxious to confess or even UNK its UNK gloom and so UNK as to reveal the fact that it UNK its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to UNK for the UNK of that truth STOP 
START similarly the optimism of age protests too much STOP 
START if it UNK that the best is yet to be it always UNK at least in the young either a suspicious question or perhaps the UNK of the negro youth who saw on a UNK the UNK i am not dead but sleeping STOP 
START boy you ain't UNK nobody but yourself STOP 
START we may say of some UNK that they were never young STOP 
START we cannot UNK say of anyone who has succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old STOP 
START those famous lines of the greek UNK with which a UNK beauty UNK her mirror at the UNK of a UNK reveal a wise attitude venus take my UNK glass since i am not what i was what from this day i shall be venus let me never see STOP 
START no good can come of UNK the sad inevitable fact that once youth has passed a worse and worse time still UNK the former STOP 
START but there are at least two reasons for UNK one's mind in even a cracked mirror STOP 
START one is that there sometimes are real although inadequate UNK in growing old STOP 
START UNK if one is fortunate enough to achieve it is not so good as joy but it is something STOP 
START even to be from hope and fear set free is at least better than to have lost the first without having got rid of the second STOP 
START the other reason and the one with which i am here concerned is that one thus becomes inclined to UNK of any opinion or change of opinion whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all too obvious physical differences STOP 
START one may be UNK aware that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of one's own age STOP 
START but at least the question has been raised STOP 
START many readers of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately even if they have never actually been told what my age is STOP 
START at least i should like them to know that i know these UNK are being made STOP 
START let me then and in public glance into the mirror STOP 
START i have known some men and women who said that the UNK they are told about or even remember seem utter UNK to them now their remote past is as UNK with their present UNK as lacking in any conscious UNK to their mature personality as the self of a UNK may be imagined UNK with that of the UNK it once was STOP 
START for my part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs STOP 
START i have changed and i have UNK opinions i am so aware of an UNK continuity of the UNK or ego that i see only as absurd the tendency of some psychologists from UNK to UNK and UNK to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which nothing remains UNK STOP 
START so far as i am concerned the child is UNK father to the man despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse STOP 
START fundamental values UNK and the way in which one approaches a conviction change less of course than specific opinions STOP 
START that fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many present-day intellectuals who were communists or UNK in their youth and are now so extremely conservative or reactionary as many would say that they can define no important political conviction that does not seem so far from even a UNK position as to make the distinction between mr. nixon and mr. khrushchev for them hardly worth noting STOP 
START but in ways more fundamental than specific political opinions they are still what they always were passionate sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of capable of seeing black and white only and therefore committed to the logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to STOP 
START to those of my readers who find many of my opinions UNK or politically or UNK UNK and i have reason to know that there are some such i would like to say what i have already UNK namely that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some discount on the simple ground that i am no longer young and therefore incapable of being youthful of mind STOP 
START but i will also remind them that i have always been inclined to UNK to a kind of UNK lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned that although not as eager as i once was to be UNK of i can still resist prevailing opinions STOP 
START at about the age of twelve i became a UNK liberal and i have always considered myself a liberal of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since spencer became a reactionary STOP 
START several times in my youth i voted the socialist ticket but less because i was socialist than because i was not either a republican or a democrat and i voted for franklin roosevelt every time he was a candidate STOP 
START yet during the years when i was on the staff of the nation i tried to the limit the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when i was permitted to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social question STOP 
START never once during the trying UNK did i come so close to UNK to the private climate of opinion as to grant russian communism even that most UNK of UNK an interesting experiment STOP 
START there are few things of which i am UNK than of that UNK record STOP 
START many of my friends at the time thought that i had received a UNK UNK when lincoln UNK UNK me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of the UNK man who could understand and UNK only with the dead past STOP 
START but he as i can now UNK was the man who could see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to russia he gave voice to the famous UNK i have seen the future and it works STOP 
START the favorite excuse of those who have now UNK their approval of communism is that they did not know how things would develop STOP 
START with this excuse i have never been much impressed STOP 
START there was it seems to me enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of russian leaders to UNK honorable men without their having to wait to see how it would turn out STOP 
START once many years ago i sat at dinner next to arthur train and the subject of the nation came up STOP 
START he asked me suddenly what are your political opinions well i replied some of my colleagues on the paper regard me as a rank reactionary STOP 
START after a UNK thought he replied that still leaves you a lot of UNK STOP 
START and i suppose it did STOP 
START i never have been and am not now any kind of utopian STOP 
START when i first came across samuel UNK UNK the remedy for the UNK of life is UNK rather than radical it seemed to me to sum up the UNK of political and social UNK STOP 
START it will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any other phrase or principle could STOP 
START why did i choose to fill these pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather UNK UNK and UNK reason is i think my awareness that my remarks last quarter on UNK may well have served to confirm the opinion of some that my tendency to UNK and UNK gets us nowhere and that i am simply too old to hope STOP 
START i would however like to suggest that wrong though i may be the tendency to see UNK rather than solutions is one of which i have been a victim ever since i can remember and therefore not merely a UNK phenomenon STOP 
START i know that one must act STOP 
START but one need not always be sure that the action is either wise or conclusive STOP 
START UNK of what some would call UNK i remember an UNK the source of which i forget STOP 
START it concerns a UNK minister who staged an impressive object lesson by UNK a lion and a UNK together in the same UNK outside his church door STOP 
START not only his UNK but the whole town and ultimately the whole county were UNK impressed by this object lesson STOP 
START one day he was visited by a delegation of UNK UNK who wanted to know his secret STOP 
START how on earth do you manage it is the trick why he replied it is perfectly simple is no trick involved STOP 
START all you have to do is put in a fresh UNK from time to time STOP 
START UNK really it seems to me STOP 
START the promise that the lion and the UNK will lie down together was given in the future tense STOP 
START it is not something that can be expected to happen now STOP 
START without really changing the general subject i take this opportunity to confess that i am troubled by doubts not only about UNK but also when asked to join in the protest against a law that most of those who consider themselves UNK and liberal seem to regard as obviously UNK the law that UNK the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no UNK circumstances STOP 
START it is not that i am unaware of the force of their strongest UNK STOP 
START life they say should be regarded as sacred and therefore as something that neither an individual nor his society has a right to take away STOP 
START in fact i cannot imagine myself UNK a man to the UNK or the electric chair if i had to take as an individual the responsibility for his death STOP 
START just as i know i would make a bad soldier even though i cannot UNK call myself a UNK so too i would not be either a UNK by profession or if i could avoid it even a member of a hanging jury STOP 
START despite these facts the question no murderer ever be executed to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a simple negative answer STOP 
START punishment of the UNK so liberals are inclined to say can have only three possible UNK UNK UNK or UNK example STOP

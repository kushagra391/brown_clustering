START she was just another UNK from the states and she seemed as commonplace as her name STOP 
START she was the john harvey one of those atlantic UNK that had UNK to bari to bring UNK bombs and bullets to the u.s. UNK air force to field marshal UNK eighth army then racing up the calf of the boot of italy in that early december of 1943 STOP 
START the john harvey arrived in bari a port on the UNK on november UNK making for UNK UNK which as the name indicates was the ancient city's new and modern harbor STOP 
START hardly anyone UNK marked her as she UNK UNK off UNK 29 on the UNK STOP 
START if anyone thought of the john harvey it was to observe that she was UNK by a pair of ships heavily UNK with high explosive and if they were hit the john harvey would likely be UNK up with her own UNK and whatever else it was that she carried STOP 
START which was UNK gas STOP 
START it had required the approval of president franklin UNK roosevelt before the john harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and UNK to the italian UNK STOP 
START for in a world as yet UNK with the UNK of the UNK cloud UNK gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons STOP 
START throughout the early years of world war 2 reports UNK that the axis powers had used gas germany in russia japan in china again STOP 
START they were always denied STOP 
START influential people in america were warning the pentagon to be prepared against UNK gas attacks by the germans in future campaigns STOP 
START some UNK went so far as to urge our using it first STOP 
START to silence UNK to warn the axis president roosevelt issued this statement for the allies in august from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the axis powers were seriously UNK use of UNK gas or UNK UNK or other UNK devices of warfare STOP 
START i have been UNK to believe that any nation even our present enemies could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and UNK weapons STOP 
START however evidence that the axis powers are making significant preparations UNK of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources STOP 
START use of such weapons has been UNK by the general opinion of civilized mankind STOP 
START this country has not used them and i hope that we never will be compelled to use them STOP 
START i state UNK that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies STOP 
START the following month the invasion of italy was begun and roosevelt gave effect to his warning by UNK to the UNK of UNK gas in southern italy STOP 
START bari was chosen as a depot not only for its seeming safety but because of its UNK to UNK STOP 
START any UNK gas attack would be UNK STOP 
START it would be made in three waves the first to lay down a UNK the second to drop the gas bombs the third to shower UNK which would burn everything below STOP 
START so the UNK UNK went into the hole of the john harvey STOP 
START a UNK of six men from the UNK chemical maintenance company under first UNK howard d. UNK went aboard followed by UNK thomas h. richardson the UNK security officer STOP 
START UNK was UNK STOP 
START only a few other people very important people knew of the UNK eggs UNK below UNK STOP 
START no one else must know STOP 
START thus in the UNK way in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not was the stage set for tragedy at bari STOP 
START it was the night of december 2 1943 and it was growing dark in bari STOP 
START it was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the german UNK plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit STOP 
START UNK a. b. UNK of the office of harbor defense was very worried STOP 
START he knew that german long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in italy STOP 
START on november UNK they had made a UNK on la UNK STOP 
START two days later some 30 of them had struck at a UNK off UNK UNK a UNK and it had been that very night that the UNK had made its first appearance STOP 
START after it had UNK the next two nights UNK went to higher headquarters and said for three days now a german UNK plane has been over the city taking pictures STOP 
START they're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and UNK this place into the UNK STOP 
START but the older and UNK heads had dismissed his warning as UNK STOP 
START even though it was known that the UNK in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic general UNK the commander who would conduct the little UNK on london in 1944 a major UNK on bari at this UNK of the war was not to be considered seriously STOP 
START true there had been UNK on UNK but UNK was pretty far north on the opposite coast STOP 
START no bari was out of range STOP 
START more than that allied air had complete superiority in the eighth UNK sector STOP 
START so captain UNK returned to his harbor post to watch the UNK plane put in five more appearances and to feel the certainty of this UNK rising within him STOP 
START for UNK knew that UNK defenses were made of paper STOP 
START the royal air force had but a single light UNK UNK and two UNK units available STOP 
START there were no UNK UNK UNK on bari UNK STOP 
START the radar station with the best location was still not UNK STOP 
START telephone communication was bad STOP 
START and everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old UNK of disaster multiple command STOP 
START it had been made UNK evident that very morning to UNK kay k. UNK in charge of the armed guard aboard the john UNK STOP 
START a british officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped STOP 
START then he was to UNK his fire with a UNK shore gun firing white UNK STOP 
START this harbor is a UNK paradise the UNK had said with frank UNK STOP 
START it's up to you to protect UNK STOP 
START we can't expect any help from the fighters at UNK either STOP 
START they're all being used on UNK missions STOP 
START UNK had been UNK STOP 
START not fire until the bombs came down thought of the tons and tons of UNK fluid beneath his feet and shook his head STOP 
START like hell hell he'd wait and UNK the UNK gun got knocked out would his guns guide on then the north star UNK decided that he would not UNK until he heard the UNK of the bombs and when night began to fall he put UNK 2 donald l. UNK and UNK 1 william a. UNK on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy UNK STOP 
START below UNK UNK 1 stanley bishop had begun to write a letter home STOP 
START above UNK on the john harvey lieutenant richardson UNK at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy STOP 
START there were lights UNK in the city too even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible STOP 
START bari was asking for it he thought STOP 
START for five days now they had been in port and that UNK stuff was still in the hold STOP 
START richardson wondered when it would be UNK STOP 
START he hoped they would put in somewhere way way down in the earth STOP 
START the burden of his secret was pressing down on him as it was on lieutenant UNK and his six enlisted men STOP 
START lieutenant richardson could UNK the officers and men of the john harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs STOP 
START they seemed happy at the delay in UNK glad at the chance to go UNK in a lively liberty port such as bari STOP 
START nine of them had gone down the UNK already STOP 
START deck UNK james l. UNK and UNK walter brooks had been the first to leave STOP 
START richardson had returned their UNK UNK with the UNK nod that is the security officer's stock in trade STOP 
START the other half of the crew plus UNK and his men had remained aboard STOP 
START richardson glanced to sea and started slightly STOP 
START damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor UNK UNK STOP 
START the night was so clear that richardson had no difficulty making out the UNK STOP 
START then the thought of a UNK sky made him UNK and he glanced upward STOP 
START his eyes UNK STOP 
START it was a clear night and it was UNK michael a. UNK military governor of the UNK UNK had also seen and felt the rain STOP 
START but he had mistaken it for UNK STOP 
START captain UNK UNK UNK with the UNK name UNK had just left UNK UNK with a UNK of UNK UNK oil for the UNK civilian population STOP 
START UNK was on deck STOP 
START at exactly UNK he felt a UNK object brush his face STOP 
START he snatched at it UNK STOP 
START he turned the beam of his UNK on it STOP 
START he laughed STOP 
START it was the silver foil from the UNK bar he had been eating STOP 
START he UNK STOP 
START but how could longer strip of UNK whipped his mouth STOP 
START it was two feet long STOP 
START it was not candy UNK STOP 
START it was window the UNK paper dropped by bombers to UNK radar sets to fill the scope with hundreds of UNK that would seem to be approaching bombers STOP 
START UNK UNK to his italian UNK STOP 
START stop the engines slowed and stopped hundreds of brilliant white UNK UNK UNK down from the black the air UNK UNK UNK rose in a UNK UNK the UNK guns UNK and UNK and above it all motors roared and the bombs came UNK and UNK and UNK down among the ships at anchor at bari STOP 
START they had come from UNK in the UNK these UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START they had UNK over the UNK they had taken bari by complete surprise and now they were UNK her UNK with deadly skill STOP 
START they had ruined the radar warning system with their window they had made themselves UNK above their UNK STOP 
START and they also had the lights of the city the port wall UNK and a shore UNK UNK to guide on STOP 
START after the first two were UNK out the third light was abandoned by a UNK italian crew who left their light to UNK for nine minutes like an UNK UNK UNK until british UNK shot it out STOP 
START in that interval the german bombers made a hell of bari harbor STOP 
START merchant ships illuminated in the light of the UNK made to seem like stones UNK in a lake of polished mud were impossible to miss STOP 
START the little UNK sank almost immediately STOP 
START captain UNK roared at his men to UNK three of the UNK of UNK oil together for a UNK STOP 
START they got it over the side and UNK aboard only a few minutes before their UNK went under STOP 
START john UNK went down early too STOP 
START UNK UNK and his UNK had fought UNK but they had no targets STOP 
START most of the UNK were above the UNK light of the UNK and the UNK shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs STOP 
START UNK rushed from gun to gun attempting to direct fire STOP 
START he was wounded but fought on STOP 
START UNK and UNK fired wildly at the sounds of the motors STOP 
START bishop rushed on deck to grab a UNK gun UNK out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into holds one three and five STOP 
START now the UNK was UNK wounded STOP 
START UNK she was not completely UNK and would go down before the gasoline could UNK STOP 
START the order to abandon ship was given but UNK of pain could be heard from the wounded below UNK STOP

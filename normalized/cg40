START i feel obliged to describe this UNK STOP 
START it had a single UNK stall and but one cabinet for the UNK of the UNK STOP 
START it was here that the UNK UNK moon played an UNK role during the children's party STOP 
START a much larger room adjacent to the UNK served as a UNK to and from the UNK toilet STOP 
START that UNK room was large enough for well say an UNK could get into it and as a matter of fact an UNK did STOP 
START something occurred on the morning of the children's party which may illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused us STOP 
START it so happened that sports writer arthur robinson got out of the hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he be back in an hour or two to continue his UNK STOP 
START arthur robinson traveled with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the american STOP 
START he was ghost writer for UNK ruth whose main talent for literary composition was the UNK of his UNK STOP 
START UNK was a war veteran with UNK knees STOP 
START he arrived on UNK at the newspaper club with one of his great UNK UNK UNK artist author and UNK of UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK appearance was that of a UNK UNK STOP 
START he seemed UNK at first wore nose glasses from which a black ribbon UNK and was no bigger than a UNK STOP 
START robinson asked UNK to UNK him to the UNK UNK before they sat down for a UNK and a game of cards STOP 
START in the UNK after UNK and his UNK were properly UNK mr. UNK went to the adjoining facility STOP 
START he had barely assumed his UNK there when a fat fellow charged through the doorway STOP 
START without any regard for UNK UNK the UNK stranger almost knocked UNK off his UNK STOP 
START the UNK said nothing but stood to one side STOP 
START he waited a long time STOP 
START nothing was said nothing accomplished STOP 
START the UNK stranger eventually turned away from the place of his shall we dare say his UNK to go to the door STOP 
START mr. UNK touched the fat man's arm STOP 
START UNK me sir STOP 
START may i say that you have just demonstrated the truth of an old UNK the younger UNK if memory serves me which translated freely from the UNK latin says the more UNK the less UNK STOP 
START governor alfred e. smith was the official host at the children's party STOP 
START united states senator royal s. UNK was wearing the UNK of santa UNK and a great white beard honorable robert wagner UNK at that time a justice of the new york supreme court was on the reception committee STOP 
START i was in charge of the arrangements which were soon enough UNK STOP 
START i had had difficulties from the very first day STOP 
START when in my enthusiasm i proposed the party my city editor who disliked the club and many of its members tried to block my participation in the UNK event STOP 
START even earlier than that he had UNK the fact that i had been chosen to UNK the UNK reporter STOP 
START city editor victor watson of the new york american was a man of brooding UNK and mysterious shifts of mood STOP 
START mr. UNK UNK code word for victor watson was UNK STOP 
START the staff saw in him the qualities of a don UNK hence as mentioned before his UNK the hetman STOP 
START the UNK physical aspects were not those of a savage rider of the UNK STOP 
START indeed he looked more like a UNK lay brother of the UNK of st. UNK STOP 
START nor were his manners UNK STOP 
START he had a UNK voice and UNK UNK UNK of features which somehow UNK the feeling that he knew where all the bodies were buried STOP 
START he was the son of a UNK father and an american jewish mother long UNK with whom he lived in a comfortable home in UNK STOP 
START he had worked in the newspaper business since he was nineteen years old always for the hearst service STOP 
START from the very first he regarded himself as mr. UNK UNK UNK and afterward his prime minister UNK STOP 
START it was said that the hetman UNK to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire one day by means of various UNK the destruction of editors who tried to UNK his course the UNK of publishers whose mistakes of judgment might be UNK in secret reports to mr. hearst STOP 
START whatever the UNK ambitions his colleagues were kept ill at ease STOP 
START among the outstanding members of the hearst cabinet whom he successfully opposed for a time were the great arthur UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and colonel van UNK STOP 
START he also disliked UNK for no good reason other than the fact that the UNK talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the UNK UNK or his supervision STOP 
START UNK for his part had a UNK regard for mr. watson STOP 
START he's a UNK said UNK and i wouldn't trust him as far as i could throw the statue of liberty STOP 
START arthur UNK UNK wrote to me just recently UNK wanted to die in UNK with his head towards the wagon STOP 
START he supported his mother and his brother who afterwards committed suicide STOP 
START watson told me that his brother always sent UNK to his mother UNK bought with UNK allowance to him STOP 
START and would you believe it UNK added she likes him better than she does me STOP 
START why the only time the hetman seemed excited was when one of his own UNK ideas was born STOP 
START then he would get to his feet as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers and say almost invariably gentlemen this is an amazing story bigger than the UNK STOP 
START some of the UNK ideas were UNK vaguely UNK and at times UNK STOP 
START one day he assigned me to lay bare a plot by the UNK to supply UNK to a wholly UNK revolution he said was about to occur in cuba STOP 
START he said that his information was so secret that he would not be able to UNK in me the origin of his UNK tip STOP 
START i can tell you this much he said STOP 
START it's bigger than the UNK STOP 
START i worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consulted several of my own UNK sources STOP 
START then i spent the next two days at the baseball park and at jack UNK pool UNK STOP 
START when i returned to make my report the hetman did not remember having sent me on the secret mission STOP 
START he was busy he said in having someone submit to a UNK operation STOP 
START and i was to go to work on that odd matter STOP 
START i shall tell of it later on STOP 
START the hetman had a strong liking for a story any story which was to be had by means of much UNK or by UNK methods STOP 
START most of my stories were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me the facts and not as a rule by playing clever UNK STOP 
START one day i tired of following the UNK advice of UNK and of the UNK approach to a report that UNK UNK had UNK a UNK UNK while visiting the central park UNK house STOP 
START i explained my state of mind to artist UNK UNK and to UNK UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK obtained a supply of UNK hair and UNK from an actor at the UNK STOP 
START we UNK UNK put them on and reported to the hetman at the city desk STOP 
START mr. UNK had an UNK beard like UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK had on a sort of emperor UNK beard and UNK STOP 
START as for myself i had on an enormous black UNK STOP 
START this together with a UNK hat and UNK UNK gave me the appearance of a russian UNK STOP 
START we are ready for your next mysterious assignment said mr. UNK to the hetman STOP 
START where to sir watson did not have much humor in his UNK but he managed a UNK smile STOP 
START just then a reporter telephoned in from the UNK to give the UNK desk an account of a murder STOP 
START the hetman told me to take the story over the phone and to write it STOP 
START while i was sitting at one of the UNK UNK with my UNK and my great beard arthur UNK UNK in with some editorial copy in his hand STOP 
START he paused for a moment to look at me then went on to the city desk to deliver his today column STOP 
START i thought it UNK to take off my UNK my glasses and the beard also to change UNK STOP 
START i managed to do this by the time the great UNK returned to the place where he last had seen the UNK UNK STOP 
START he stood there staring with UNK at the vacant desk STOP 
START then he wrinkled his huge UNK and went slowly out of the room STOP 
START he had a somewhat UNK expression STOP 
START he had been seeing things STOP 
START the UNK ideas for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always UNK or lacking in merit STOP 
START he UNK successfully for the UNK of death avenue and also brought about the ending of UNK of metropolitan beaches by sewage STOP 
START he exposed the UNK UNK with the able assistance of two excellent reporters UNK UNK and carl UNK STOP 
START in the conduct of these and many other campaigns the hetman proved to be a much UNK UNK than his critics allowed STOP 
START it seems to me now in a long backward glance that many of the UNK UNK and odd actions together with his grim posture when UNK the UNK in the name of mr. hearst were UNK with the tragedy which was to close over him one day STOP 
START alone rejected on every hand UNK and in financial trouble he leaped from an UNK window of the UNK hotel in UNK STOP 
START one finds it difficult to pass UNK on the lonely figure who waited for days for a saving word from his UNK served UNK UNK hearst STOP 
START that word was UNK when the need of it seemed the measure of his despair STOP 
START the UNK note written in pencil upon the back of a used envelope and addressed to the UNK makes one wonder about many things god forgive me for everything STOP 
START i cannot much to UNK UNK UNK as well as my own i got along UNK with the hetman is until i became an editor hence in his eyes a rival STOP 
START not long after colonel van UNK had UNK me on the watson staff i received a salary raise and a contract on the UNK recommendation STOP 
START during the next years he gave me the second of the five contracts i would sign with the hearst service STOP 
START it was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those days before the epidemic of UNK UNK STOP 
START i would like to believe that my ability UNK this UNK STOP 
START somehow i think that watson paid more attention to me than he otherwise might have because his UNK colonel van UNK wouldn't touch me with a UNK blue pencil STOP 
START i remember one day when mr. hearst and i never knew why he liked me either sent the hetman a UNK please find some more reporters like that young man from denver STOP 
START watson showed this wire to colonel van UNK STOP 
START the colonel UNK then made a remark which might be UNK in either of two ways STOP 
START don't bother to look any further STOP 
START we already have the only one of its kind STOP 
START the hetman did have friends but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession STOP 
START sergeant mike UNK congressional UNK of honor soldier was one of them STOP 
START dr. UNK s. UNK was another STOP 
START i used to go with watson to call on the UNK UNK at his apartment to sit among the doctor's excellent collection of UNK paintings and books and drink oriental coffee while watson seemed to UNK out and become almost UNK STOP 
START there was one time however when his face UNK and he suddenly UNK why did my brother commit suicide cannot remember dr. UNK reply if indeed he made one STOP

START right said the UNK man STOP 
START also if you're going to believe those UNK you'll have to look for a killer who's a UNK piano player STOP 
START he demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano doing a UNK passage with a UNK exaggerated attack STOP 
START to make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change of manner the killing of rose UNK STOP 
START his hands snatched at an imaginary UNK UNK down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that's been bounced hard STOP 
START in the same way he UNK UNK a UNK and UNK UNK off that pressing his hands against the floor and UNK UNK off that STOP 
START he was moving like a ballet dancer playing for UNK STOP 
START if rose UNK killer acted this way UNK up with him was going to be a UNK STOP 
START we'd know him by his stretch UNK and the flowers he'd wear UNK in his hair STOP 
START perhaps if felix had first come upon us when this boy was not UNK so UNK up and down the hall outside the UNK woman's apartment we might have had less trouble convincing felix of our UNK STOP 
START this you will remember was still new year's day STOP 
START by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet UNK up it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's UNK and paper hats STOP 
START felix was the exception STOP 
START he had retained his hat and his horn and whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it STOP 
START that incidentally might give you some idea of what felix was like STOP 
START after all he hadn't happened upon us in that UNK hall without warning STOP 
START the UNK boys had finished their UNK examination and the body had been removed for UNK STOP 
START the meat wagon therefore was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any UNK and UNK STOP 
START there was furthermore the crowd of curious UNK gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance STOP 
START just put yourself in UNK place for a moment STOP 
START you're a taxpayer UNK landlord STOP 
START you've been away from home for the new year UNK but now the party is over and you come home STOP 
START UNK UNK in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol UNK and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober STOP 
START you still have your paper hat and you're wearing it but then it is an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else you may be you are also the UNK who created that most peculiar UNK out in the back yard STOP 
START it's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will mr. average citizen STOP 
START you have your paper horn UNK in your big UNK fist and for your entrance you have planned a UNK colorful and UNK UNK to your friends and UNK STOP 
START you find your house a focus of public and police attention STOP 
START can you imagine yourself UNK under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so UNK UNK and armed with a paper horn one could be startled into UNK STOP 
START you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you UNK up to the cop on the door STOP 
START you identify yourself and ask him what's going on STOP 
START instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and UNK up the stairs STOP 
START got the upstairs guy he UNK STOP 
START the owner STOP 
START do i send him up he turns back to you STOP 
START go on in he says STOP 
START they'll tell you what's cooking STOP 
START even then as you go into the house UNK by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this UNK official control could you go on UNK that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand i'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for UNK being an odd one STOP 
START we'd seen his UNK out in the back yard and the little his UNK had told us of him did make him sound a little special STOP 
START we were not however prepared for anything like the UNK that confronted us as felix came up the stairs STOP 
START he of course must have been equally UNK for what confronted him but UNK i did find his reaction startling STOP 
START if felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he'd forgotten about them he now remembered STOP 
START he came UNK up the stairs and joined the dance STOP 
START he adjusted the hat lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a UNK and fell in alongside our UNK expert to UNK with him STOP 
START our man stopped dead and UNK at felix STOP 
START felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the UNK of even that UNK built old house STOP 
START this was a bull of a man STOP 
START he was UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START his face was UNK and heavy and UNK and when he laughed he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably UNK STOP 
START i don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so UNK not UNK STOP 
START his hair had UNK most of the way to the back of his neck STOP 
START he had only a fringe of hair and he wore it UNK short STOP 
START it was almost as white as his teeth STOP 
START for a man of his mass he was curiously short STOP 
START he wasn't a UNK but he was a bit of a UNK figure STOP 
START a man with so big and so UNK developed a UNK and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand UNK than five feet five STOP 
START for felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement STOP 
START the man was just this side of being a UNK STOP 
START we waited till he had finished laughing and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him STOP 
START he was dressed in a manner UNK might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend STOP 
START dark gray sports jacket lighter gray UNK pink UNK shirt black silk UNK STOP 
START his eyes were clear STOP 
START he was UNK UNK and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed UNK some UNK of it on the massive UNK of his laughter STOP 
START not even a UNK STOP 
START eventually he UNK STOP 
START felix said STOP 
START me he said UNK STOP 
START me the happy one STOP 
START that much latin we remember UNK said UNK STOP 
START you always live up to your name always like this always making happy i try felix said UNK STOP 
START the world is full of UNK who put their hearts into making the tragic scene STOP 
START i've never noticed that it improves things any STOP 
START UNK for you UNK said STOP 
START what's the rest of your name no rest of it STOP 
START felix is all there is STOP 
START all there ever was the past i leave to historians felix UNK UNK that he could be UNK as well as happy STOP 
START you live in the present in the present felix UNK STOP 
START for the future STOP 
START is there any other time in which a man can live we UNK announced are not UNK STOP 
START we are assistant district UNK STOP 
START this gentleman is a police officer STOP 
START he is a UNK specialist STOP 
START could your future your immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him your finger tips happy one could never have looked happier STOP 
START this was more than joy STOP 
START it was UNK STOP 
START those lovely UNK he UNK STOP 
START so UNK so beautiful STOP 
START come right along STOP 
START i love UNK STOP 
START he was UNK along the hall heading for the next flight of stairs STOP 
START UNK called him back STOP 
START we're here because of what happened last night he said STOP 
START past yes but important STOP 
START since it is important for the record let's have the full name STOP 
START that important asked STOP 
START that important STOP 
START UNK felix whispered STOP 
START felix UNK asked not UNK to whisper STOP 
START UNK felix UNK STOP 
START i can't see what would make it necessary for you to know STOP 
START nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world STOP 
START UNK UNK lowered his voice STOP 
START felix UNK repeated STOP 
START no STOP 
START UNK but not for years STOP 
START for years it's been just felix STOP 
START first thing i did after my UNK birthday was go into court and have it officially changed and this is something i don't tell everybody STOP 
START that was almost forty years ago STOP 
START having UNK that he was a man of about sixty he UNK up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less UNK STOP 
START this was a UNK of a boy our felix and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in UNK how UNK he was and how full of juice and spirit STOP 
START we followed him up the stairs STOP 
START the cops would gather up UNK and the UNK on the third floor and bring us those of them who would UNK submit to UNK STOP 
START you may think we didn't need UNK and jean but you always get what you can when you can and we had no UNK that a UNK record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case STOP 
START also if we had UNK the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood STOP 
START the killer if in our present group would certainly be interested in knowing that much and even though with the UNK evidence what it was i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation there might always be some way STOP 
START if you can possibly avoid it you don't hand out any extra chances STOP 
START felix took us into his studio STOP 
START it was that UNK shaped space at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope STOP 
START at each angle of its pitch a big UNK had been fitted into the roof and all these UNK were fitted with systems of multiple UNK and shades STOP 
START when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night STOP 
START he quickly fixed that rolling back the shades on some of the UNK and adjusting UNK on the others STOP 
START he flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience STOP 
START none of his movements was tentative STOP 
START there was no process of trial and error STOP 
START starting with the room completely UNK out as it was when we came in he UNK fixed things so that the whole place was UNK in the maximum of light without at any point UNK even so much as a crack of UNK STOP 
START expecting something UNK UNK i was surprised by what we found STOP 
START there was no display of either works in progress or of finished work STOP 
START here and there on work table or UNK stood a shape with a sheet or a UNK UNK over it STOP 
START these shapes might have been mad but there was no telling STOP 
START they were all completely UNK STOP 
START the equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition STOP 
START everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the UNK comfort convenience and efficiency STOP 
START there were tools about but they were neatly kept STOP 
START there was no confusion and no UNK STOP 
START supplies of sheet metal were neatly UNK in UNK STOP

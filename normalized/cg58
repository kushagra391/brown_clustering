START from new jersey morgan UNK to the headquarters of washington at UNK pennsylvania arriving there on november UNK STOP 
START there was much UNK in the corps and the men were in addition without the clothing shoes and blankets needed for the winter weather STOP 
START morgan himself had UNK again STOP 
START even on his tough constitution the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest STOP 
START on the morning of november UNK UNK and UNK men had left philadelphia with the object of UNK fort mercer at red bank new jersey STOP 
START in order to prevent this washington UNK to UNK several units to UNK the fort including a force under the UNK de lafayette containing some UNK of UNK UNK all who were fit for duty at this time the rest having no shoes STOP 
START although the fort was UNK in the face of the force of UNK morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing at the UNK STOP 
START a UNK guard of about UNK mostly UNK were attacked by the americans under lafayette and driven back to their camp some twenty to thirty of them falling before the UNK fire STOP 
START i never saw men lafayette declared in regard to the UNK so UNK so UNK and so UNK to go on to the enemy whatever force they might have as that small party in this fight STOP 
START UNK greene told washington that lafayette was UNK with the UNK behavior of the militia and UNK STOP 
START a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an attack upon the american camp STOP 
START the british general moved his forces north from philadelphia to UNK hill near the right wing of the UNK UNK STOP 
START here the pennsylvania militia UNK with the british but soon fled STOP 
START morgan was ordered to attack the enemy who had meantime moved to edge hill on the left of the americans STOP 
START similar orders were given to the maryland militia STOP 
START morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait STOP 
START a body of UNK were seen marching down a nearby slope a UNK target for the UNK who threw a UNK into their ranks and UNK up the smart formation considerably STOP 
START now the UNK and the UNK followed up their beginning and closed in on the british giving them another telling round of fire STOP 
START the UNK ran like UNK STOP 
START but the maryland militia had likewise fled all too typical of this type of soldier during the revolution an experience which gave morgan little confidence in militia in general as he watched other instances of their breaking in hot UNK STOP 
START the british although suffering considerable losses noted the UNK of the UNK made a stand then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly UNK and had to UNK STOP 
START the americans lost UNK men among them major joseph morris of UNK regiment an officer who was regarded with high UNK and affection not only by his commander but by washington and lafayette as well STOP 
START the latter was so upset on learning of the death of morris that he wrote morgan a letter showing his own UNK UNK STOP 
START after UNK morgan and the UNK and saying he was UNK them to congress too the ardent UNK added he felt that congress should make some financial UNK to the widow and family of morris but that he knew morgan realized how long such action usually required if it was done at all STOP 
START as mrs. morris may be in some want before that time lafayette continued i am going to trouble you with a commission which i beg you will UNK with the greatest UNK STOP 
START if she wanted to UNK any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of congress it would not become a stranger unknown to her to offer himself for that purpose STOP 
START but you could as from yourself tell her that you had friends who being with the army don't know what to do with their money and would UNK let her have one or many thousand dollars STOP 
START this was accordingly done and the UNK of the grateful mrs. morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan the amount of which is not known STOP 
START apparently still sensitive about the idea with which general gates had approached him at UNK namely that george washington be replaced morgan was UNK in his support of the UNK during the campaign around philadelphia STOP 
START richard UNK secretary of the board of war thought morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick a quarrel STOP 
START morgan UNK denied this and informed the board of war that the men in camp linked the name of UNK with the plot against washington STOP 
START UNK insisted that this impression was a great misunderstanding and evidently from the quarrel obtained an UNK impression of UNK judgment STOP 
START such a situation regarding the board of war could hardly have helped UNK chances for promotion when that matter came before the group later on STOP 
START in late december the american army moved from UNK to valley UNK and although the distance was only 13 miles the journey took more than a week because of the bad weather the UNK and almost naked men STOP 
START the position of the new camp was UNK selected and well UNK its easily UNK nature being one good reason why howe did not attack it STOP 
START besides helping to prevent the movement of the british to the west valley UNK also UNK the trade between UNK forces and the farmers thus threatening the vital UNK of the UNK and rendering their UNK to obtain necessary supplies extremely UNK STOP 
START in order to see that this UNK situation remained effective washington detached several bodies of his troops to the UNK of the philadelphia area STOP 
START morgan and his corps were placed on the west side of the UNK river with instructions to UNK all supplies found going to the city and to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy STOP 
START the headquarters of morgan was on a farm said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for british gold rather than the virtually UNK continental currency STOP 
START in his UNK with UNK however morgan was typically firm but just STOP 
START for example he captured some persons from york county who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife and who apparently was helpless to prevent the UNK of his household goods STOP 
START morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its UNK owners but he let the UNK who had stolen it go free STOP 
START morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him for UNK duty most of them he said being useless STOP 
START they UNK at such a rate he told the UNK that if the enemy were UNK they might get two from us when we would take one of them which makes me wish general howe would go on lest any incident happen to us STOP 
START if the UNK of the winter at valley UNK were trying for healthy men they were of course much more so for those not in good health STOP 
START daniel UNK UNK condition UNK with the increase of the cold and damp weather STOP 
START he had UNK the elements and the enemy but the strain aided by the winter was UNK up with him at last STOP 
START also he was now UNK years old STOP 
START the mild activity of his command during the UNK of the troops at valley UNK could be handled by a UNK he felt so like henry UNK equally loyal to washington who went to boston at this time morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia for several weeks STOP 
START in his absence the rifle regiment was under the command of major thomas UNK another able UNK STOP 
START but morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a william UNK in salem massachusetts apparently an UNK UNK washington and saying that the UNK UNK about him were opposed by the general current of the people to UNK general gates at the expense of general washington was UNK to the latter STOP 
START if there be a UNK UNK in america UNK general washington and his UNK none can question STOP 
START it is doubtful if morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children for his pay as shown by the war department UNK of early UNK was UNK a month as a colonel and that apt to be delayed STOP 
START he was shown a warm welcome regardless and spent the time in winchester UNK from his UNK enjoying his family and arranging his private affairs which were of course run down STOP 
START his neighbors celebrated his return even if it was only temporary and morgan was especially UNK by the quaint expression of an elderly friend UNK lane who told him a man that has so often left all that is dear to him as thou UNK to serve thy country must create a sympathetic feeling in every UNK heart STOP 
START there must have been special feelings of joy and UNK in the heart of daniel morgan too when the news was received on april UNK of the recognition by france of the independence of the united states STOP 
START his fellow UNK george washington had stated i believe no event was ever received with more UNK joy STOP 
START the UNK camp at valley UNK was turned into an UNK of UNK STOP 
START even the UNK washington UNK in a game of UNK with some children STOP 
START his soldiers on the whole did not UNK so UNK STOP 
START on may UNK morgan who had returned received from washington orders to send out UNK under UNK officers to keep near the enemy STOP 
START the reason for this the orders said is that the enemy may think to take advantage of the celebration of this day STOP 
START the troops must have more than the common quantity of liquor and perhaps there will be some little UNK among them STOP 
START apparently no serious UNK resulted from the celebration and within a few days morgan joined the force of lafayette who now had command of some UNK men at UNK hill not far above philadelphia on the UNK STOP 
START the UNK had been ordered to approach the UNK lines UNK them and get intelligence of their movements STOP 
START UNK enough the order UNK to morgan through alexander hamilton also informed him that a party of indians will join the party to be sent from your command at UNK and act with them STOP 
START these were UNK indians STOP 
START washington evidently was anxious for morgan to be UNK as well as aggressive for on may UNK UNK and 20th he UNK the leader of the UNK to be on the alert STOP 
START obviously the UNK had confidence that morgan would furnish him good intelligence too for on the UNK of may he told morgan that the british were prepared to move perhaps in the night and asked morgan to have two of his best horses ready to UNK to general UNK with the intelligence obtained STOP 
START meantime however this same general UNK seemed to be serving UNK as well as the american army STOP 
START colonel benjamin ford wrote to morgan from UNK that he understood a mrs. UNK from maryland had obtained permission from UNK to visit philadelphia and would return on may UNK UNK by several officers from maryland belonging to the new UNK in the british service STOP 
START ford urged morgan to capture these men who he thought might be disguised as UNK or peasants STOP 
START morgan took the suggested steps but when mrs. UNK appeared there was nobody with her but her husband whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned STOP 
START but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general STOP 
START a letter of a few days later from UNK UNK to morgan stated his UNK is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion STOP

START and i'll take you with me STOP 
START the two of them against the world STOP 
START that had been how she imagined it STOP 
START for when he began to talk and dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun dreaming too STOP 
START but now the dream was over STOP 
START the big waking up had happened STOP 
START what did i imagine thought STOP 
START did i see him about to swing low in a UNK maybe UNK up the south fork of the UNK deer river UNK the UNK UNK in it i saw him on a UNK with a gang of UNK UNK it STOP 
START and i'll take you with me STOP 
START he had taken her all right STOP 
START wednesday nights after youth fellowship STOP 
START out of the church and into his big car it UNK over the road with him driving and the UNK sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college his UNK the quaint little pine board tourist courts UNK really with a UNK naked light UNK in the ceiling UNK and naked as a UNK like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid where you watched the UNK UNK in after the UNK watching in between your UNK at UNK a room complete with UNK UNK the light and the few casual UNK UNK the walls an insect highway patrol with UNK waving STOP 
START and the bed that UNK in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for UNK talk in the next room when UNK went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened STOP 
START and UNK UNK would be in UNK today for the wedding UNK and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along STOP 
START like UNK and the mayor up there UNK the UNK and UNK UNK back in his office UNK out teeth like they all knew he would STOP 
START just like the UNK would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a UNK or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen STOP 
START or you could hope the UNK wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any harm to UNK UNK in his suit of red UNK but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be UNK but must stand the UNK feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice i think i'm UNK STOP 
START you could wish that STOP 
START or you could wish your UNK would really do it kill UNK UNK like he said when you all the time all along could feel the nerve UNK out of him like air out of a UNK tire when you are on a UNK road alone and it is UNK and at night STOP 
START so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the UNK waiting for you for your new UNK UNK waiting for you to UNK by yourself out there in your tight skirt crying and afraid and trying to get that damned UNK tire off because that is being an old maid too if you happen to drive a car it is changing the tire yourself in the night and in the mud and the rain UNK to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help STOP 
START and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has UNK you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell a combination like ham and eggs UNK her and kill her and that is being an old maid too STOP 
START it is not having his baby UNK warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some UNK UNK your UNK STOP 
START and most of all it is not having the only man you could love whether he UNK a bread truck or UNK the mail or checks the UNK UNK down at the UNK or owns seventeen oil wells and six UNK mines for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one STOP 
START he can even be a UNK UNK guy with UNK ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even UNK couldn't figure out how it is unlocked STOP 
START and he can be on the way to UNK your UNK UNK can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him really want him dead STOP 
START because if you can't then nobody else can either nobody else can have him STOP 
START for you don't share him not even with god STOP 
START if it is love you don't STOP 
START and i'll take you with me STOP 
START even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie STOP 
START even when he is on the way to UNK you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside of you STOP 
START and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants you or not you go with him in your heart STOP 
START you feel him every mile further away STOP 
START you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could love him the way you do the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't STOP 
START and you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy the UNK who begged you to marry him the one with the UNK hair and the car he couldn't afford and the UNK shoes STOP 
START you think did he feel that way about me comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have UNK UNK he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him that other guy STOP 
START it UNK on you that instead of a UNK to fill the seat across the bridge table from you he was a man and that because UNK UNK was making you miserable you were passing it down to him to UNK UNK substitute that other guy STOP 
START and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st. louis where he got to be a big unhappy success STOP 
START you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you STOP 
START you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself to give somebody else the one they wanted to give them you STOP 
START damn the world she thought STOP 
START she looked out at the corn field the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the UNK fence UNK the grounds STOP 
START the mayor UNK factories there STOP 
START homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart while you tried not to look at the UNK and the UNK and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments STOP 
START the bands were UNK but they were the only ones STOP 
START the others the ones in the stands were UNK for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city STOP 
START it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano UNK UNK STOP 
START he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day STOP 
START so they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not listening exactly but rather feeling STOP 
START if a man was good if he was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever STOP 
START you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too STOP 
START it was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it STOP 
START you laughed and then your chest UNK and you felt you could cry for a little bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the UNK UNK UNK along your arm STOP 
START he hit the theme about dying to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without a second thought STOP 
START while he talked you wouldn't trade being a west tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world no matter if it hadn't in six weeks UNK enough to wet a UNK UNK STOP 
START she glanced at the man UNK beside her a man with weather UNK UNK into his lean cheeks with UNK pale eyes reflecting all the UNK he had seen reflecting the sky and the UNK which must follow now in august yes with eyes UNK the UNK and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts of UNK UNK would not leave her STOP 
START i should have stayed at the store she thought STOP 
START back at the UNK with the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was UNK which made her young enough to UNK the usual ideal working conditions like the UNK toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down STOP 
START there was no lock because UNK didn't allow a lock STOP 
START a lock on the toilet would encourage UNK and UNK STOP 
START the toilet hadn't had a sincere UNK in years and there were things written on the walls of the little UNK place because you couldn't keep the public out entirely STOP 
START she could not count the times UNK had UNK on the door just a couple of UNK that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the pipe connections from the wall STOP 
START the two little UNK meant that he was getting UNK to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would UNK open the door and drag out by the opposite door handle which she would be UNK UNK clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot STOP 
START and the hours were UNK in the morning until eleven at night on UNK and during sales and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or UNK STOP

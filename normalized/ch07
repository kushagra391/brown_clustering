START special districts in rhode island STOP 
START -hlit is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island STOP 
START however a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government STOP 
START there are UNK special district governments in rhode island excluding two regional school districts four housing authorities and the kent county water authority STOP 
START these UNK special purpose governments have the authority to UNK taxes to UNK money own property sue and be UNK and in general to exercise normal corporate powers STOP 
START unlike cities and towns however they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state bureau of UNK STOP 
START it is not an UNK to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government STOP 
START in addition to the collection of service charges the special districts UNK annual property taxes of approximately UNK STOP 
START fiscal years in other states comparative data STOP 
START a review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report STOP 
START included in the findings are 1 STOP 
START UNK states including rhode island end their fiscal year on june 30 STOP 
START the other four states end on varying dates alabama sept. 30 new york march 31 pennsylvania may 31 and texas august 31 STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlin sixteen states the fiscal year ending of the cities june 30 is the same as that of the state alaska UNK california delaware massachusetts UNK UNK new mexico north carolina north UNK oklahoma oregon vermont west virginia UNK and hawaii STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START -hlin eleven states the fiscal year of the cities ends on december 31 while the state fiscal year ends on june 30 arkansas colorado indiana kansas new hampshire new jersey ohio south UNK UNK washington and wisconsin STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START -hlin eight states whose fiscal years close on june 30 a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december 31 georgia UNK kentucky UNK maryland minnesota virginia and south carolina STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START UNK state alabama UNK its fiscal year on september 30 and all cities in the state with one exception also close fiscal years on september 30 STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START UNK UNK its fiscal year on june 30 while all of its cities close their fiscal years on september 30 STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START UNK UNK its fiscal year on may 31 STOP 
START all of its cities close their fiscal years on december 31 STOP 
START the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state city and local governments STOP 
START however only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation in which the UNK units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity STOP 
START fiscal uniformity advantages and UNK advantages STOP 
START an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently STOP 
START he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity 1 STOP 
START -hlthe uniform fiscal year requires UNK with common sense administration of local UNK UNK of the budget or financial plan in advance of spending STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe uniform fiscal year UNK UNK with another common sense rule that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn STOP 
START it UNK towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START -hlthe uniform fiscal year UNK more careful UNK and UNK control over expenditures STOP 
START by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending upper limits are set on expenditures STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START -hlthe uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools which UNK the largest share of local UNK STOP 
START this greatly UNK the town's UNK and financial reporting STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START -hlthe uniform fiscal year UNK interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes STOP 
START furthermore tax UNK not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes UNK the town's UNK revenues and reducing the tax UNK STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START -hlthe uniform fiscal year UNK UNK comparison of revenues and expenditures STOP 
START when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful UNK as the cost of local government increases the demand for such comparison also increases STOP 
START towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare STOP 
START of all advantages probably none is more important than the UNK of tax anticipation notes STOP 
START UNK in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of UNK at all times STOP 
START it may be by bank loans sale of notes or UNK or by the somewhat casual method of UNK and registration of UNK STOP 
START in any event it is a form of UNK which could be and should be rendered unnecessary STOP 
START its UNK would result in the saving of interest costs heavy when short-term money rates are high and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most STOP 
START this type of UNK can be reduced to a minimum if UNK UNK payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year STOP 
START any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security STOP 
START it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful UNK reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year STOP 
START both the federal and state governments UNK their fiscal years on july 1 STOP 
START both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great UNK with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on UNK and the UNK sharing of responsibility for certain important functions this is no longer true STOP 
START the UNK fiscal year calendar is an UNK to the planning of clear and efficient UNK revenue and expenditure relationships STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START UNK there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island there are also certain difficulties encountered STOP 
START these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual UNK to the principle STOP 
START one problem is a matter of shifting dates other is how to finance the transition STOP 
START little can be done about the changing of dates STOP 
START this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars STOP 
START it usually means a confused and UNK UNK public for a period of time STOP 
START but cooperation and understanding between local officials and the UNK help UNK this problem STOP 
START the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns STOP 
START this will be covered more fully later STOP 
START it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city STOP 
START fortunately there are no cities or towns in the state with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change STOP 
START sacrifice will have to be made in some cases but it is to the UNK advantage to finance the UNK for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes UNK STOP 
START adjusting the fiscal calendars the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well UNK fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for rhode island UNK to exert effort to secure them STOP 
START the type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed STOP 
START two features are immediately evident STOP 
START first the present situation is too varied to be UNK by any single formula STOP 
START second the shift to a uniform july 1 to june 30 fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns STOP 
START there are at least two problems to consider one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary STOP 
START the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section STOP 
START twelve cities and towns in rhode island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax year calendar STOP 
START plans vary from the talking stage to establishing special committees to accomplish this end STOP 
START what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them STOP 
START an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought STOP 
START however it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved STOP 
START the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island based on a july 1 to june 30 year are shown below STOP 
START no adjustment needed STOP 
START UNK cities and towns are presently on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it STOP 
START no change is required for these towns STOP 
START these UNK include UNK lincoln UNK newport north UNK and south UNK STOP 
START adjustment of fiscal year STOP 
START UNK town and one city UNK and east providence require an adjustment of their fiscal year only STOP 
START this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax UNK due and UNK in the fiscal year UNK within that year STOP 
START adjustment of tax collection year STOP 
START UNK cities and towns are now on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity STOP 
START these cities and towns include UNK UNK UNK UNK central falls and UNK STOP 
START UNK adjustments STOP 
START UNK cities to be considered providence and cranston are an UNK STOP 
START both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars STOP 
START however neither of these two cities is on the desired july 1 to june 30 fiscal year STOP 
START the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them STOP 
START in that both cities end their fiscal years on september 30 they could UNK taxes for an interim period of nine months UNK with september 30 and ending with june 30 STOP 
START these three UNK dates would be october 26 january 26 and april 25 providence and november 15 february 16 and may 15 cranston STOP 
START both would start their new fiscal year on july 1 STOP 
START their tax collection calendar could then be july 25 october 26 january 26 and april 25 providence august 15 november 15 february 17 and may 15 cranston STOP 
START under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same UNK periods STOP 
START varying adjustments STOP 
START -hlthe remaining UNK towns have fiscal years which end prior to june 30 STOP 
START all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years STOP 
START assuming an adjustment to the july 1 to june 30 fiscal year the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in table 3 STOP 
START methods of financing adjustments aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary STOP 
START it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or UNK of interim UNK do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements STOP 
START in many communities there is simply no financial problem is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods careful fiscal planning and management or some like combination of techniques STOP 
START in other UNK the difficulties in UNK the financial burden have been sufficiently great to UNK UNK of fiscal year changes STOP 
START fortunately such cases in rhode island are more the exception than the rule STOP 
START as shown earlier in table 1 the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars STOP 
START in addition no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition STOP 
START these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars the financial condition of the UNK and the length of the transition interval STOP 
START suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to UNK and require UNK ranging from short-term UNK notes to long-term bonds STOP 
START the financial problem where it exists usually stems from the UNK of a budget for the UNK or adjustment period STOP 
START for those communities which have financial difficulties in UNK adjustments there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone or in combination with others would minimize if not even eliminate the problem STOP

START the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract STOP

START this is the key fact emerging from UNK national election STOP 
START chancellor UNK christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute UNK majority it has enjoyed since 1957 STOP 
START in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength STOP 
START inevitably this means some compromise STOP 
START the UNK chancellor in all UNK will be retired STOP 
START both UNK UNK social democrats who gained 22 seats in the new parliament and the free democrats who picked up 23 will insist on that before they enter the government STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK the economic expert probably will UNK to the leadership long denied him STOP

START better ask before joining americans are a nation of UNK a quality which our friends find UNK and sometimes amusing STOP 
START but it can be dangerous if the UNK doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself STOP 
START for instance so-called conservative organizations some of them secret are UNK in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root STOP 
START one specific example is a secret UNK which will UNK UNK efforts STOP 
START the principle is UNK but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get UNK STOP 
START according to the chicago tribune news service state UNK gen. stanley UNK of california has devised a series of questions which the UNK might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1 STOP 
START does it UNK schools and churches with blanket UNK STOP 
START does it attack other traditional american institutions with UNK and wild charges STOP 
START does it put the label of UNK or UNK on everyone with whom it UNK politically STOP 
START does it attempt to UNK modern history by UNK american UNK for wars communism depression and other troubles of the world STOP 
START does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns STOP 
START do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they UNK to advocate some instances a seventh question can be added 7 STOP 
START does the organization show an UNK for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or UNK to the american system the UNK UNK asks these questions he is not likely to be UNK by UNK who are seeking to UNK on the UNK and the UNK UNK of americans in a troubled time STOP 
START falling somewhere in a category between UNK theory and sand UNK difficult to see but UNK there nevertheless is the tropical green city of UNK a string of UNK islands that has almost no residents limited access and an unlimited future STOP 
START the latter is what concerns us all STOP 
START whatever land you can see here from the north tip end of UNK key looking UNK belongs to someone people who have title to the land STOP 
START and what you can't see the land underneath the water belongs to someone too STOP 
START the public STOP 
START the only real problem is to UNK a plan whereby the owners of the UNK land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment STOP 
START in the fairly brief but UNK history of florida the UNK of UNK land have too often wound up with both their land and ours STOP 
START in this instance happily insistence is being made that our share is protected STOP 
START and until this protection is at least as concrete as say the row of hotels that bars us from our own UNK at miami beach those who represent us all should agree to nothing STOP 
START closed doors in city hall the reaction of certain city council members to UNK newest UNK laws was as UNK as it was UNK STOP 
START we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making the UNK of its committees and the city commissions available to the public STOP 
START in the UNK to the UNK UNK UNK known as the brown act the legislature declares that the public commissions boards and UNK and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business STOP 
START it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their UNK be conducted openly STOP 
START the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them STOP 
START the people in UNK authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know STOP 
START the full UNK of these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature STOP 
START since 1953 california has led the nation in UNK UNK that public business shall be publicly conducted but not until this year did the UNK in UNK plug the remaining UNK in the brown act STOP 
START despite the lip service paid by local governments the UNK UNK have been continuously UNK by UNK and UNK STOP 
START when all else fails it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations STOP 
START we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law and one of its principal aims STOP 
START without public scrutiny the UNK of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more UNK STOP 
START but the citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were UNK STOP

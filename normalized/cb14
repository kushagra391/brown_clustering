START this is the period during the UNK days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call UNK day STOP 
START they seek thereby to UNK the old UNK back to the old scenes STOP 
START the football opponent on UNK is of course selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a christian when thrown to one of the UNK UNK STOP 
START it is true of course the UNK of life being what they are that as now and then the christian killed the lion UNK days have been ruined by a visiting team STOP 
START even with all possible UNK UNK are usually rather cruel and sad and only the UNK UNK and the continually optimistic are made happy by them STOP 
START more often than not as the old UNK UNK along the old paths his memory of happy days when he UNK one of the paths with a UNK beside him becomes an UNK and a pain STOP 
START he can smell again the UNK she wore and recall the UNK sound of laughter and can smell again the UNK of autumn fallen leaves the wine of cool air and the UNK of UNK which UNK through all the winds of fall STOP 
START UNK it is at precisely such moments that he UNK a couple of UNK faces UNK holding hands and talking happily as they come along UNK of him or throwing him the most UNK and casual of UNK such as they would give a UNK UNK STOP 
START usually they UNK loudly after they have passed by STOP 
START his dream goes STOP 
START he feels suddenly the weight of the fat that is on him STOP 
START his UNK or his plates feel loose and monstrous STOP 
START his UNK UNK STOP 
START his legs suddenly feel heavy and UNK weary as if he had walked for miles instead of UNK a few hundred yards along the old campus paths STOP 
START bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like UNK UNK in his mouth STOP 
START it is not much better if he meets with old UNK STOP 
START too often unless he UNK them they pass him by STOP 
START he recalls with a UNK smile the wit who said on returning from a UNK reunion that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him STOP 
START if they do meet and recognize one another UNK backs and embrace the moment soon is done STOP 
START after all when one has asked whatever became of old joe and charlie when one has inquired who it was sue brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it STOP 
START UNK spread by then one begins to notice the UNK spread gray hairs the UNK bodies that are too thin or too heavy UNK signs of old beauty UNK of UNK years who UNK a size UNK suit and UNK when he has finished a sentence of any length then it is time to break it up and move on STOP 
START it is if anything worse on the old player he UNK in the stands and he doesn't like that STOP 
START enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a UNK in the crowd STOP 
START he always feels lonely STOP 
START a team feels something STOP 
START on a team a man feels he is a part of it and UNK to the men next to him STOP 
START in the stands he is lonely and lost no matter how many are about him STOP 
START he UNK there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped UNK of UNK feet the UNK of the canvas UNK smell and feel of hot wet UNK UNK across his face STOP 
START he remembers the desperate UNK breath long runs on the UNK hard UNK UNK UNK desperate UNK of UNK stands STOP 
START and so he UNK with each play remembering his youth STOP 
START but it is no use STOP 
START it is gone STOP 
START no matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength they can never be UNK again STOP 
START since the obvious is not always true the republican national committee UNK analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred as suspected in the larger cities STOP 
START of 40 cities with UNK of UNK and more mr. kennedy carried 26 and mr. nixon 14 STOP 
START there are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election STOP 
START these are new york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois and minnesota STOP 
START in 1952 mr. eisenhower won all but missouri STOP 
START yet in 1960 all eight gave UNK to mr. kennedy STOP 
START republican research broke down the vote in philadelphia STOP 
START mr. nixon despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups failed to do so STOP 
START his visit to UNK poland after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the polish vote which in several cities is substantial STOP 
START yet the gop breakdown discovered that in philadelphia mr. nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called polish vote per cent of the irish vote and 18 per cent of the negro vote STOP 
START task force a gop task force committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities STOP 
START the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leaders STOP 
START these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming UNK to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr. kennedy for talking about a UNK and unemployment STOP 
START this error was compounded by UNK the UNK to be a statistical one and not a reality STOP 
START the almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their UNK as statistical STOP 
START they did not view the tour of the UNK cities and towns by secretary of labor UNK as politics which the gop declared it to be STOP 
START the people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery STOP 
START senator UNK gross UNK of president eisenhower's conversation into a UNK of president kennedy as too left wing a statement mr. eisenhower declared to be entirely false is another case in point STOP 
START if the republicans and southern democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program they will thereby erect still another UNK to gop hopes in the cities STOP 
START errors repeated the present republican leadership as UNK by UNK UNK bridges UNK et al is UNK the errors of the party leadership of the UNK STOP 
START in that decade the partisan UNK to defend mr. UNK and the UNK failure to anticipate or cope with the depression caused a great majority of americans to see the republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash STOP 
START the republican party was not lacking in humanity but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear UNK of any consideration for people in trouble STOP 
START farmers called their UNK pickup trucks UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK reduced to the UNK spoke of the UNK tobacco as UNK dust STOP 
START one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error STOP 
START but it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to UNK john f. kennedy STOP 
START that this is not good politics is UNK by the latest UNK figures which show that UNK per cent of the people like the way in which the new president is conducting the nation's business STOP 
START the most UNK republicans are those who in their desire to get back at mr. kennedy already have created the image of a republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the UNK and the UNK and which is even more UNK to help old people who need medical care STOP 
START if they also defeat the school bill the gop task force won't have much research to do STOP 
START it will early know why the party won't win back city votes STOP 
START the 1962 general assembly has important business to consider STOP 
START the tragedy is that it will not be able to UNK that business in any responsible manner STOP 
START after the UNK political UNK has completed the circuit in november in the name of a UNK UNK this is going to be the most politically oriented legislature in history STOP 
START every UNK from UNK UNK to UNK is going to have his every vote subjected to the UNK scrutiny as a test of his political UNK not his convictions STOP 
START UNK legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever STOP 
START and just how far can the legislature go toward setting up a UNK system for the state in the midst of a governor's race UNK will be the recommendations of UNK gov. UNK UNK senate committee on government operations situation already was bad because the legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months causing the UNK to get started earlier than usual STOP 
START but when former gov. UNK UNK and UNK gov. UNK accepted the invitations of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november the situation was UNK STOP 
START neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation STOP 
START to have refused would have been political suicide STOP 
START and it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity when the UNK comments are cast aside STOP 
START the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates STOP 
START it wanted the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious candidates STOP 
START but state party chairman james gray of albany said no and he didn't UNK any words STOP 
START they are just asking too much he said STOP 
START we can't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates either STOP 
START there are other dangers politics is an UNK game STOP 
START if an opponent UNK you of lying don't deny it STOP 
START say he is a horse UNK runs an old UNK STOP 
START these men are UNK STOP 
START if either one ever started making promises there is no telling where the promises would end STOP 
START UNK rural roads authority and UNK UNK miles of county contracts would look like UNK UNK STOP 
START the trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one STOP 
START why not have them travel the state in november UNK would present a UNK for them in almost every community STOP 
START but further thought brings the UNK UNK of a governor's race being run in the next legislature the UNK of big spending programs the UNK of UNK before the campaign should even begin STOP 
START there is a way out of this STOP 
START the chamber has not arranged a UNK UNK STOP 
START it has arranged a campaign for governor STOP 
START if it will simply delay the UNK until the qualifications are closed next spring and then carry all the candidates on a tour of UNK it can provide a service to the state STOP 
START but the legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race STOP 
START former british prime minister UNK says eisenhower was not a great soldier STOP 
START UNK somewhat like george washington STOP 
START both won a pretty UNK war with a modest assist from british strategy STOP 
START UNK returning from UNK say the people UNK president kennedy so much they're even willing to UNK his call to sacrifice and give up his program STOP 
START UNK of the john UNK society UNK your own UNK STOP 
START the guy who makes the motor boats may be a communist STOP 
START a republican survey says kennedy won the UNK election on the religious issue STOP 
START too many people were afraid if the gop won they'd have to spend all their time UNK STOP

START UNK UNK shared last night's UNK stadium concert with three american composers STOP 
START his portion of the program and a big portion it was consisted of half the major nineteenth-century UNK for the violin to wit the UNK and the UNK STOP 
START that is an evening of UNK that would UNK many a younger man UNK is 70 years old STOP 
START there were UNK persons at the stadium who can tell their UNK that they heard UNK STOP 
START but with all due respects and allowances it must UNK be said that what they heard was more UNK than sweet more UNK than musical STOP 
START the occasion was sentimental was the playing STOP 
START the american part of the evening consisted of paul UNK dance UNK william UNK UNK from new england UNK and two works of UNK UNK dance rhythms UNK UNK and a UNK for strings UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK is purely a UNK with spanish english french and american dances mixed into the UNK STOP 
START the UNK with its latin UNK UNK is just this side of the pale his sweet attractive UNK it belongs to what the composer called his UNK mostly category of works STOP 
START the UNK UNK takes off from an old william UNK UNK with UNK UNK and brass effect STOP 
START all these UNK or no provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively colorful UNK works well suited for the great UNK STOP 
START it was nice to have something a little UNK for a change STOP 
START we have UNK UNK to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the stadium symphony STOP 
START a woman who UNK artificial UNK against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely UNK of a question of UNK UNK new british import at the UNK STOP 
START since an objective UNK might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise the UNK extensive discussion of the problem seems at best UNK STOP 
START in its present UNK UNK form the subject matter seems designed to invite UNK UNK STOP 
START with UNK london UNK the central role with UNK sincerity the UNK UNK is at least attractive STOP 
START the explanation offered for her conduct is a UNK attempt to save her marriage to a UNK husband left UNK as a result of an automobile accident STOP 
START anthony steel as the husband is a UNK type who UNK against her course and UNK for divorce UNK her action UNK STOP 
START the actor plays his role UNK under the UNK direction of don UNK as do UNK UNK as his UNK father and UNK UNK as an innocent UNK STOP 
START after a UNK UNK trial scene more notable for the UNK of its language than for dramatic UNK the jury to no one's surprise leaves the legal question UNK STOP 
START when the husband drops the case and returns to his wife both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place STOP 
START so was the audience STOP 
START london july 4 for its final change of bill in its london season the UNK state UNK ballet chose tonight to give one of those UNK UNK known as a UNK program at the royal opera house UNK garden STOP 
START no doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the UNK and UNK that have distinguished its UNK thus far it too could give a UNK if it pleased STOP 
START and please it did in every sense of the word for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of london audiences STOP 
START at the end of the program indeed there was a demonstration that lasted for UNK minutes and nothing could stop it STOP 
START UNK UNK repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number UNK UNK but even then there was a substantial number of UNK who seemed determined not to go home at all STOP 
START only a plea from the house manager john UNK finally broke up the party STOP 
START but for all the UNK intention to show off this was a UNK with a difference for instead of UNK in quality to what is known as a popular level it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company STOP 
START the UNK UNK UNK is a UNK version of UNK UNK UNK UNK by UNK UNK to music of UNK STOP 
START it is UNK by some thirty-five men and no women and it contains everything in the books UNK comedy UNK UNK and UNK that only UNK or russians would attempt to make the human body perform STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and mr. UNK were the chief UNK but everybody on stage was magnificent STOP 
START at the other extreme in character was the UNK UNK from the UNK ballet UNK which opened the evening STOP 
START what a man this UNK was why do we in the west know so few of his UNK scene is a white ballet in which a UNK hero UNK for his UNK UNK spirit among UNK UNK beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human which of course is altogether fitting STOP 
START the ensemble enters in a long UNK passage that is of fantastic difficulty as well as UNK and UNK is the general medium of the piece STOP 
START its UNK UNK UNK UNK simple UNK of beauty and UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK make up a UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK as the UNK male meets the competition well with some brilliant hits but the work is designed to belong to the ladies STOP 
START the middle section of the program was made up of short numbers naturally enough of UNK merit but all of them pretty good at that STOP 
START they consisted of a new arrangement of UNK UNK UNK UNK by UNK UNK and mr. UNK with a large ensemble winning little snow UNK variation by the UNK UNK UNK of those poetic UNK in greek UNK and superb UNK UNK by UNK UNK and UNK UNK in one case and UNK UNK and UNK UNK in the other amusing character UNK de UNK called UNK women stirring flames of paris UNK de UNK by UNK UNK and UNK UNK and a lovely version of UNK le UNK by UNK UNK which had to be repeated STOP 
START UNK UNK was the conductor STOP 
START it was quite an evening year ago today when the democrats were UNK and UNK in los angeles and john f. kennedy was still only an able and ambitious senator who UNK for the power and responsibility of the presidency theodore h. white had already UNK masses of notes about the presidential campaign of 1960 STOP 
START as the pace of the UNK american political festival accelerated mr. white took more notes STOP 
START he traveled UNK with mr. kennedy and with richard m. nixon STOP 
START he asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the UNK UNK STOP 
START he assembled quantities of facts about the nature of american politics in general as well as about the UNK course of the UNK presidential election in american history STOP 
START those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election little we know of what there is to be known is made UNK clear by mr. white in the making of the president 1960 STOP 
START this is a remarkable book and an UNK interesting one STOP 
START what might have been only UNK UNK journalism turns out to be an UNK contribution to history STOP 
START mr. white who is only a competent novelist is a brilliant reporter STOP 
START his UNK for specific detail his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere his UNK industry and his UNK turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book STOP 
START a lesson in politics as a dramatic narrative the making of the president 1960 is continuously UNK STOP 
START and as an introduction to american politics it is highly educational STOP 
START the author begins this volume with a UNK of mr. kennedy his family and his UNK waiting for the returns STOP 
START he then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal presidential UNK five democrats senator UNK h. UNK senator stuart UNK senator UNK b. johnson UNK e. stevenson and mr. kennedy and two republicans governor rockefeller and mr. nixon STOP 
START then in UNK order mr. white covers the primary campaigns the UNK and the presidential campaign itself STOP 
START in the process he writes at length about many related matters the importance of race religion local tradition UNK organizations UNK volunteers and television STOP 
START mr. white is UNK frank in his personal opinions STOP 
START he frequently UNK intimate details that seem to come straight from the UNK mouth from numerous UNK and from mr. kennedy himself never from mr. nixon who looked on reporters with suspicion and UNK STOP 
START rarely in american history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or UNK them less says mr. white STOP 
START mr. nixon he believes has no particular political philosophy and UNK his own campaign STOP 
START although a UNK politician and a UNK and honest man mr. nixon mr. white believes ignored his own UNK planners wasted time and effort in the wrong regions missed opportunities through UNK and UNK his chances on television STOP 
START mr. nixon is a UNK UNK man given to long UNK of UNK UNK only himself and his wife STOP 
START he is a man of major talent but a man of solitary uncertain impulses STOP 
START he was above all a friend UNK almost UNK in his UNK to be liked STOP 
START he wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them least UNK candidate since alfred m. UNK STOP 
START mr. kennedy mr. white believes had UNK politics on so many different levels that no other american could match him STOP 
START calm UNK composed UNK eloquent mr. kennedy always knew everything about everybody STOP 
START he enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many UNK volunteers STOP 
START every decision was made quickly on sound grounds STOP 
START efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance STOP 
START mr. kennedy did not neglect to UNK the personal friendship of reporters STOP 
START mr. white UNK him UNK and leaves no doubt that he is a democrat himself who expects mr. kennedy to be a fine president STOP 
START pressures UNK throughout the making of a president mr. white shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates how decisions have constantly to be made how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down how UNK play key roles STOP 
START and he makes many interesting comments STOP 
START here are several the root question in american politics is always who's the man to see understand american politics is simply to know people to know the relative weight of names who are heroes who are straw men who controls who does not STOP 
START but to operate in american politics one must go a step further one must build a bridge to such names establish a warmth a personal connection STOP 
START in the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major american party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion STOP 
START all UNK are meaningless the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party UNK to lead it STOP 
START UNK week at UNK stadium which had begun with the appearance of the UNK UNK UNK on tuesday night continued last night as UNK UNK led the list of UNK in an evening of french UNK UNK STOP 
START miss UNK is certainly not 70 no UNK ever is and yet the UNK of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present UNK STOP 
START the better part of UNK might be perhaps to honor her UNK good looks and her UNK UNK gown and to UNK the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing STOP 
START no orchestra however could be expected to follow a UNK through quite as many adventures with pitch as miss UNK encountered last night STOP 
START in all UNK there were UNK of the great UNK of UNK UNK even of the old UNK UNK STOP 
START one such moment came in the UNK way miss UNK sang the UNK to UNK shadow song STOP 
START the years suddenly fell away at this point STOP 
START on the whole however one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to UNK her own reputation as time UNK UNK on STOP 
START sharing the program was the young UNK UNK richard UNK making his stadium debut on this occasion STOP 
START mr. UNK began UNK with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant UNK when pushed beyond middle volume STOP 
START later on this problem vanished and the flower song from UNK UNK was beautifully and UNK projected STOP

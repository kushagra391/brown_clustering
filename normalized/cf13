START farming is UNK STOP 
START the UNK life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock STOP 
START livestock must be tended every day UNK STOP 
START a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens STOP 
START even if there are no livestock the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods particularly during the growing season STOP 
START the worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily STOP 
START he cannot leave the farm to take work in another UNK on short notice a move may mean a loss of capital STOP 
START hard physical labor and UNK hours are a part of life STOP 
START the farmer must get up early and at times work late at night STOP 
START frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain STOP 
START no matter how well work is planned bad weather or unexpected UNK can cause extra work that must be caught up STOP 
START it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the UNK machinery that a full-time farmer can UNK in UNK STOP 
START production may fall far below expectations STOP 
START UNK UNK disease and insects take their toll of crops STOP 
START UNK or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the UNK earnings even into his capital STOP 
START returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year STOP 
START the high cost of land supplies and labor make it difficult to farm UNK on a part-time basis STOP 
START land within UNK distance of a growing city is usually high in price higher if it has subdivision possibilities STOP 
START part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities STOP 
START if the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high farm labor costs will also be high STOP 
START a part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen per cow or per UNK as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer STOP 
START it will frequently be UNK for him to own the most UNK equipment STOP 
START he may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations such as UNK or UNK and for these he may have to wait his turn STOP 
START there will be losses caused by UNK that arise while he is away at his UNK job STOP 
START the farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost STOP 
START this may be true whether the farm is owned or UNK STOP 
START if the farm is UNK the rent must be paid STOP 
START if it is owned taxes must be paid and if the place is not free of mortgage there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of STOP 
START advantages a farm provides a wholesome and UNK environment for children STOP 
START it gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air STOP 
START the children can do chores adapted to their age and ability STOP 
START UNK for a calf a UNK or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work STOP 
START part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost provided the farm is owned free of debt and UNK enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs STOP 
START for some retired persons part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income STOP 
START it is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health STOP 
START generally the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city STOP 
START the savings are not as great however as is sometime supposed STOP 
START usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and UNK somewhat more STOP 
START where schools fire and police protection and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country real estate taxes are usually about the same STOP 
START a part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time UNK STOP 
START some persons consider the work on a farm UNK STOP 
START for some UNK workers it is a welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner STOP 
START land labor and equipment needed part-time farming can take comparatively little land labor and equipment or a great deal STOP 
START it depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation STOP 
START general requirements for land labor and equipment are discussed below STOP 
START specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14 STOP 
START land three quarters to 1 UNK of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use and for a small UNK of chickens a cow and two UNK STOP 
START you could not of course raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small STOP 
START if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale you'll need more land STOP 
START in deciding how much land you want take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect STOP 
START but consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work STOP 
START the cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision STOP 
START some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development STOP 
START this is a highly UNK venture STOP 
START sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract STOP 
START when surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might UNK the residential value of the farm STOP 
START labor if you have a UNK full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help STOP 
START as a rule part-time farmers hire little help STOP 
START in deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1 STOP 
START list the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month STOP 
START you may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one STOP 
START do not include all your spare time or all your UNK spare time only what you are willing to use for farm work STOP 
START equipment if you are going to produce for home use only you will need only hand tools STOP 
START you will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing however STOP 
START for larger UNK you'll need some kind of power for plowing UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START if you have a UNK of half an UNK or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor available for UNK to $500 with UNK 1960 prices STOP 
START these UNK are not entirely satisfactory for plowing particularly on heavier soils so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing STOP 
START cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the UNK farmer STOP 
START if you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery UNK when you choose among farm enterprises STOP 
START you can keep your machinery investment down by buying good UNK machinery by sharing the cost and UNK of machinery with a neighbor and by UNK someone with machinery to do certain jobs STOP 
START if an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed such as a spray UNK a combine or a UNK it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work STOP 
START selecting a farm before you look for a farm you'll need to know 1 the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake 2 whether you want to buy or rent STOP 
START information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture STOP 
START if you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy STOP 
START discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm STOP 
START location UNK to work STOP 
START -hl-- choose a location within easy UNK distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities STOP 
START then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm STOP 
START the presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable STOP 
START obviously the farm should be on an UNK road STOP 
START UNK to markets STOP 
START -hl-- if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby STOP 
START if you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk for example you should be close to a town or city STOP 
START kind of neighborhood STOP 
START -hl-- look for a farm in a neighborhood of UNK homes STOP 
START there are UNK in the country as well as in the city STOP 
START few rural areas are protected by UNK STOP 
START a UNK filling station UNK yard rendering plant or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value STOP 
START facilities in the area STOP 
START -hl-- check on the schools in the area the quality of teaching and the provision for transportation to and from them STOP 
START find out whether fire protection sewage system gas water UNK and electrical lines are available in the UNK STOP 
START if these facilities are not at the door getting them may cost more than you expect STOP 
START you may have to provide them yourself or get along without them STOP 
START you cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water STOP 
START if you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one UNK STOP 
START a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden STOP 
START pond water can be UNK for human use but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble STOP 
START the following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses STOP 
START UNK and soil is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise you can't tell get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist STOP 
START soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones STOP 
START small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop STOP 
START the house will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence much will it cost to do any necessary UNK and UNK the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if UNK or a central heating system must be installed check into the cost of making these improvements STOP 
START buying a farm the value of the farm to you will depend on its worth as a place to live STOP 
START the value of the products you can raise on it STOP 
START the possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision STOP 
START decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town STOP 
START take into account the difference in city and county taxes insurance rates utility rates and the cost of travel to work STOP 
START next estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm STOP 
START to do this set up a plan on paper for operating the farm STOP 
START list the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year STOP 
START estimate the value of the produce at normal prices STOP 
START the total is the probably gross income from farming STOP 
START to find estimated net farm income UNK estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming STOP 
START include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment STOP 
START also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family STOP 
START it may be hard to decide what this labor is worth but charge something for it STOP 
START otherwise you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor STOP 
START to figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way STOP

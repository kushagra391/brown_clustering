START the most beautiful bed of pansies i've seen was in a south UNK yard on a UNK day STOP 
START pansies are supposed to like it cool but those great UNK flowers were healthy and UNK in the UNK sun STOP 
START i sought out the UNK and asked him what he did to produce such UNK in that weather STOP 
START he seemed puzzled by my question STOP 
START i just love them he said STOP 
START the more i talked with him the more convinced i became that that was the secret of their UNK UNK STOP 
START of course his love was expressed in intelligent care STOP 
START he planted the UNK seeds himself buying them from a UNK specialist STOP 
START these specialists i learned have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers STOP 
START their seeds produce vigorous UNK plants half again the size of the UNK UNK STOP 
START i asked him if he took seeds from his own plants STOP 
START occasionally when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did UNK seeds he told me soon run down STOP 
START it's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them STOP 
START his soil was nothing special just prairie land but he had UNK in UNK until it was loose UNK and UNK STOP 
START i UNK it and had the feeling of UNK that comes with the right texture UNK and body STOP 
START it isn't easy to describe it but every UNK knows it when his fingers touch such soil STOP 
START nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies STOP 
START they UNK quickly the tiny plants appearing in a week and grow along UNK STOP 
START it doesn't really matter which month of the year you UNK them but they UNK best when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours STOP 
START i like to make a UNK right in the open though many people start them successfully in cold frames STOP 
START pansies don't have to be UNK rather have things rugged with only moderate protection on the UNK days STOP 
START if you do use a cold frame be sure that its UNK is adequate STOP 
START for my UNK i use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage UNK STOP 
START i UNK it rake it smooth UNK the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray STOP 
START then i cover the UNK with a board STOP 
START this keeps it cool and moist and UNK it from birds STOP 
START UNK carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no UNK hills nearby STOP 
START when the first UNK of green appears i remove the board STOP 
START a light porous UNK applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth STOP 
START i like UNK for this or hay STOP 
START when they have 4 to 6 leaves and are UNK little plants it's time to set them out where they are to remain STOP 
START every time you UNK a UNK you cause its flowers to become smaller STOP 
START the moral is don't UNK it any UNK than you must STOP 
START as soon as they are large enough to move i put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom STOP 
START i put a little UNK of UNK UNK rock or UNK bone meal into each hole with the plant STOP 
START that UNK UNK and the better developed the roots the larger and more UNK the flowers STOP 
START pansies are UNK STOP 
START i doubt if it is possible to UNK them STOP 
START i UNK lots of UNK into their bed that UNK UNK spread over the bed is fine STOP 
START one year i simply set the plants in the remains of a UNK pile to which a little sand had been added and i had the most beautiful pansies in my or any of my UNK experience STOP 
START in addition to the rich soil they benefit by UNK of UNK water every other week UNK to the color of weak tea STOP 
START as a substitute for this organic UNK dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions may be used STOP 
START they need UNK STOP 
START we put a light UNK over the UNK we must use a heavy one STOP 
START three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping UNK down and the soil moist and cool STOP 
START when winter comes be ready with additional UNK STOP 
START i like hay for this and apply it so that only the UNK of the plants show right after a good UNK STOP 
START that keeps in the cold UNK UNK and UNK the UNK of alternate freezing and UNK STOP 
START don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter STOP 
START whenever there is a UNK or a few sunny days you'll be likely to find a brave little UNK or two STOP 
START if those aren't enough for you why not grow some just for winter UNK pansies i cherished most UNK for me in february during a particularly cold winter STOP 
START i started the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansies in a cold frame STOP 
START an UNK UNK would have been better if i had had one STOP 
START the plants took zero nights in their stride with nothing but a UNK of straw over the glass to protect them STOP 
START in response to the UNK days of february they UNK then UNK their UNK UNK flowers STOP 
START that cold frame was my morale builder mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time i looked at it STOP 
START like UNK in december pansies are far more exciting in february than in may STOP 
START try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it STOP 
START the day will come in UNK when you find your plants becoming UNK running to UNK foliage at the expense of UNK STOP 
START try UNK down each separate branch to the earth using a bobby pin to hold it there STOP 
START pick the flowers keep the soil UNK and each of the UNK branches will take root and become a little plant and go on UNK for the rest of the season STOP 
START as soon as an experimental UNK UNK you that roots have taken over cut it off from the mother plant STOP 
START a second and also good practice is to shear off the UNK leaving an inch high UNK with just a leaf or two on each branch STOP 
START these UNK plants will UNK and UNK in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring STOP 
START i like to shear half my plants at a time leaving one half of them to UNK while the second half is getting started on its new round of UNK STOP 
START probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the UNK go to seed STOP 
START UNK aim different from ours is to provide for the coming generation STOP 
START that done her work is accomplished and she UNK the plant STOP 
START here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your UNK seeds STOP 
START go to a UNK UNK preferably a UNK specialist STOP 
START it is no harder to raise big healthy UNK plants than weak UNK little things fact it is easier STOP 
START but you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow STOP 
START many people think that pansies last only a few weeks then their period of growth and bloom is over STOP 
START that is not true STOP 
START if the plants are cared for and protected over the winter the second year is more UNK than the first STOP 
START would you like to grow exhibition pansies about half the branches from each plant leaving only the strongest with the largest UNK STOP 
START the flowers will be huge STOP 
START pansies have character STOP 
START they stick to their principles insist upon their due but grow and bloom with UNK UNK if given it STOP 
START treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the UNK ones STOP 
START give them food some shade UNK water and more food and they'll UNK your UNK with beauty STOP 
START a UNK with UNK and UNK is a popular and wonderfully UNK addition to a meal but add an UNK and you have something really special STOP 
START this delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship UNK anywhere in the united states STOP 
START it has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made UNK a part of your diet yet you really should STOP 
START you will find that UNK is unlike any other fruit you have ever UNK STOP 
START it is roughly shaped like a large UNK and when properly UNK its dark green skin covers a UNK UNK UNK that has about the consistency of a ripe UNK UNK but UNK STOP 
START the UNK should have a give to it as you hold it when it is ripe STOP 
START the flavor is neither sweet like a UNK nor UNK like an orange is subtle and rather UNK UNK STOP 
START it is a flavor that might take a little getting used to not because it is unpleasant but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits STOP 
START sometimes it takes several UNK of UNK to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world STOP 
START once you become an UNK fan you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation STOP 
START naturally UNK and no spray danger today UNK carriers have made the shipping of UNK possible to any place in the world STOP 
START the fruit is allowed to mature on the tree but it is still firm at this point STOP 
START it is brought to packing houses cleaned and UNK as to size and quality and packed in protective UNK STOP 
START the fruit is then cooled to UNK a temperature at which it UNK into a sort of UNK state STOP 
START this cooling does not change the UNK in any way it just UNK the natural UNK of the fruit until a UNK temperature room temperature is restored STOP 
START this happens on the UNK shelf or in your kitchen STOP 
START one of the most attractive things about UNK is that they do not require processing of any kind STOP 
START there is no UNK or UNK or UNK needed STOP 
START if the temperature is controlled properly the UNK will delay its UNK until needed STOP 
START and unlike other fruits one cannot eat the skin of the UNK STOP 
START it is thick much like an egg UNK skin so that UNK UNK if they are used present no hazard to the consumer STOP 
START UNK and a cholesterol UNK good taste and UNK plus safety from spray UNK would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit even if its UNK values were limited STOP 
START UNK however are very rich in UNK STOP 
START their main UNK is an abundance of UNK UNK UNK so necessary for maintaining the good health of the UNK system STOP 
START aside from this the average portion contains some protein an UNK amount of UNK a and c about UNK of the minimum daily requirement and about a third of the official UNK e requirement STOP 
START the b UNK are well represented especially UNK and UNK STOP 
START calcium UNK and iron are present in UNK amounts and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts STOP 
START none of these values is destroyed not significantly altered by refrigeration storage STOP 
START dr. wilson c. grant of the UNK administration hospital UNK UNK florida and the university of miami school of medicine set out to discover if UNK because of their high content of UNK UNK UNK would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients STOP 
START the study UNK 16 male patients ranging in age from 27 to UNK STOP 
START they were put on control UNK to determine as accurately as possible the normal cholesterol level of their blood STOP 
START then they were given 1 to UNK UNK per day as a substitute for part of their UNK fat consumption STOP

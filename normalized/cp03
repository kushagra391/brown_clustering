START he'd mentioned it himself at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that UNK had left because UNK had UNK him for roy UNK STOP 
START it was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it UNK STOP 
START UNK stayed to get my pin but it'll be a cold day in june when i go back STOP

START what else was there to say to the UNK he found some favorite lines from UNK swift on his lips under the window in UNK weather i marry this man and woman together STOP 
START let none but him who rules the thunder put this man and woman UNK STOP 
START UNK for his lie questioned god's taking time to telegraph the message but he felt better about UNK and he took the sealed envelope from its UNK wondering why he had preserved it STOP 
START if he died before she did she would never be unable to resist opening it STOP 
START in any case he would be UNK a burden on his remaining sons making them parties to a UNK UNK his own STOP 
START it was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing STOP 
START you've told god frank he said STOP 
START why UNK the congregation for an old clay pot UNK of pioneer days he tore the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little UNK to flame watching it UNK the red UNK wax melting and UNK in the UNK ash STOP 
START surely now his beloved son could rest in peace STOP 
START and let me go for the night UNK me and in the night shall no man gather fruit STOP 
START a beautiful and UNK line a subtle genius UNK difficult not to UNK a gifted man and perhaps he did STOP 
START but there were great UNK even for a small man STOP

START there lay grand UNK UNK his own young UNK UNK but new life and promise for his sons UNK STOP 
START he poured his UNK of wine for the toast he'd made so often STOP 
START to absent loved ones STOP 
START but this last time he drank not to brace but to UNK UNK UNK was the only person she knew of in the UNK pleasant neighborhood who called him that was kind but too UNK STOP 
START it didn't bother him for everybody from the UNK to the preacher to say UNK miss UNK adding a UNK roy but it did her STOP 
START he could put a stop to it she told him again and again STOP

START and don't tell me you didn't at church sunday STOP 
START i heard you really hadn't meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr. UNK STOP 
START how strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and UNK blanche as to its beautiful UNK and fail her in spiritual ways STOP 
START another weakness far more UNK than his manner of speaking which he made only UNK effort to change was his devotion to that old horse of UNK STOP 
START her horse rather STOP 
START but mr. UNK now oh my yes indeed yes called her the mare much as mrs. UNK spoke of the queen god UNK her STOP 
START he with fifteen or twenty horses or UNK or UNK or UNK out there in the barn was UNK only of the mare the UNK mare the UNK UNK STOP

START she UNK UNK UNK whose UNK was due then too for hours to his UNK that the war and mist UNK poverty afterwards had UNK the mare of many a racing triumph and to his UNK of greatness for the UNK of UNK to come UNK could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her UNK and showed it STOP 
START UNK symbolized so much that was unpleasant UNK the indifference with which the UNK and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her UNK swollen stomach STOP 
START human birth was no UNK to mr. UNK STOP 
START UNK was a fine UNK and could get here quick he suggested STOP 
START UNK UNK to having dr. UNK a former UNK seemed silly to him but he would humor her get anybody she wanted the best never being too good for her STOP 
START the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sure STOP 
START he would be in the barn or riding for the UNK after night he stayed with UNK in the dead of winter rubbing her with UNK of expensive UNK UNK over her UNK UNK as the cook did over charlotte UNK UNK UNK on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house STOP 
START yet when the dear baby came he had UNK over here in a UNK and was as UNK and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been STOP 
START UNK wished now that she had had dr. UNK feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into UNK STOP 
START there was something not nice about UNK though their father seemed pleased showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted saying you don't see UNK UNK down the pike UNK day miss UNK UNK STOP

START what about royal UNK why don't you name him jesus christ she burst into tears STOP 
START roy was deeply UNK STOP 
START he'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet UNK had been STOP 
START of course she wasn't herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it STOP 
START he had a good idea why not STOP 
START those elegant at home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes again and had the house all UNK up hadn't brought many UNK in two whole months STOP 
START doc UNK and miss UNK had come STOP 
START so had miss UNK UNK full of criticisms about the changes here giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his UNK rest last year saying how much she enjoyed her UNK house in town in UNK weather was looking forward to UNK UNK this summer STOP 
START there was an idea STOP 
START miss UNK had been right UNK ever since they were married though you'd have thought a UNK would have brought her round STOP 
START oh she'd come to see them once left silver UNK UNK for all of the trips STOP 
START but when miss UNK went over right away to return the call miss UNK couldn't have been very UNK for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there STOP 
START more and more these days she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her over to UNK and UNK his own old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and UNK under the house everybody friendly inside making a UNK over the babies dressed like UNK STOP 
START though he was glad she got on well with his young folks she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too STOP 
START it made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea miss UNK had given him to be told by miss UNK that her holy UNK was all reserved for this summer and next if you please and that much as she regretted it they would be unable to entertain mrs. UNK and the children STOP 
START she hoped they were well STOP 
START he didn't tell miss UNK but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course knew those UNK UNK and she really took a fit STOP 
START if he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame STOP 
START have a party UNK leave 'em out UNK he suggested STOP 
START a UNK party send an invite to UNK but them those folks you met at the UNK house the ones i've got to know in this new UNK club affair the whole UNK neighborhood STOP 
START we'll have UNK couple UNK UNK UNK in a crowd any time STOP 
START i'll see word gets round STOP 
START don't you dare miss UNK was funny that way funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and UNK up STOP 
START he was UNK worried about her but there was one more thing he could try STOP 
START UNK was surprised when UNK UNK stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that UNK UNK had had a call to UNK in some mountain town STOP 
START roy smiled he did have a nice smile took off his hat most UNK told her to UNK in and he'd give her a lift to UNK STOP 
START her UNK was only UNK and she hoped he didn't notice it as she settled herself asked quickly how miss UNK and the babies were getting on STOP 
START see for yourself miss UNK STOP

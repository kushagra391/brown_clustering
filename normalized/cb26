START tenure as criterion i would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by russell UNK dec. 16 STOP 
START it has to do with UNK UNK and tenure STOP 
START next september after receiving a degree from UNK master of arts in teaching program i will be teaching somewhere that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers STOP 
START i will also be UNK STOP 
START the amazing thing is that this too is caused by the UNK of teachers STOP 
START teaching is at present a UNK market a result UNK the public must be satisfied with UNK teachers STOP 
START but this is not the real problem UNK arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality STOP 
START hence all teachers good and bad who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary STOP 
START i am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country the profession is UNK UNK STOP 
START it follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases is a limit to how much the public will pay for UNK performance STOP 
START the only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them STOP 
START the only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure STOP 
START here as in all UNK of the economy quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so UNK STOP 
START loss of initiative on the eve of the great debate on the proposal to give the president broad powers to make UNK UNK UNK which could practically bring us into the atlantic community we should face the alternatives on this proposition STOP 
START what we will be UNK in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the UNK trade principle under which we now operate STOP 
START without this power we lay open any american industry which the UNK may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others STOP 
START it is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs STOP 
START a brief for the negative i UNK with mr. UNK position on the common market nov. 18 as a desirable organization for us to join STOP 
START for him to ignore the political consequences involved in an atlantic union of this kind is difficult to understand STOP 
START the pressure for our entry to the common market is mounting and we will proceed towards this UNK trade union by way of a purely economic UNK or garden path with the political UNK kept neatly in the background STOP 
START the appeal is going to be to the UNK and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal as well as economic UNK STOP 
START in entering this union we will be UNK most if not all of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the atlantic institute recently set up or the UNK UNK and others STOP 
START to think that we can merely UNK our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is UNK thinking STOP 
START if it is not enough that all of our UNK one UNK are UNK that we join this market i refer you to an article in the new york UNK magazine section nov. 12 1961 by mr. UNK johnston entitled we must join the common market STOP 
START he says it has swept aside UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK customs STOP 
START referring to britain he says we see a nation that UNK values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy placing this authority in continental hands STOP 
START since the goal of our international planners is a world government this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for once american economic autonomy is absorbed a larger UNK is a question of time STOP 
START frankly it is being very UNK done for in a sense they have us over a barrel STOP 
START listen to what mr. johnston has to say consider the savage UNK that UNK would UNK STOP 
START we would lose our UNK markets and deny ourselves the imports we need STOP 
START we would be UNK by reduced output industrial decline widespread unemployment STOP 
START but the solution to this dilemma is not the UNK of the united states into an atlantic community or economic empire but merely what UNK like henry UNK and UNK UNK UNK have been UNK for years an end to government regulations an end to government competition in industry and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry STOP 
START create a free market here give us a sound UNK money system and we'll compete with anyone europe and asia combined STOP 
START in short get this governmental UNK off our backs and we won't have to worry about european competition or communism either STOP 
START if we want to preserve our sovereignty this is the way to do it UNK to an international planning board STOP 
START if we go into this common market we might just as well stop talking about constitutional UNK UNK UNK or for that matter UNK in general STOP 
START we welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a UNK discussion of the atlantic common market which UNK will be continuing in our pages STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START mental UNK UNK chinese were the only major silver UNK in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on monday morning november 27 UNK by two days the announcement of the u.s. treasury that the UNK offering price will be removed STOP 
START a professor and the army in 1954 i was UNK and after serving two years UNK on active duty i was not required to participate in any further army reserve activities STOP 
START now more than five years later i cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier STOP 
START but in spite of this i at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor have been recalled by direction of the president to report on november UNK to fort UNK massachusetts for another twelve months of active duty as an UNK 4 the equivalent of a UNK STOP 
START today seven years after the date of my initial UNK as a UNK i am assistant professor of philosophy and science at st. UNK college STOP 
START for after leaving the army in 1956 i spent five years in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of UNK STOP 
START this time added to that which i had already spent in school prior to my UNK in 1954 makes a total of UNK 22 years of education STOP 
START the possibility of recall into the army is part of the price that a modern american has to pay for the UNK heritage of liberty which he UNK STOP 
START with this no loyal citizen can quarrel STOP 
START however it seems UNK that the government has an obligation to exercise its UNK reasonably UNK and with full regard for the UNK which it inevitably causes STOP 
START in my own case i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is UNK lacking STOP 
START taken back into the army now as an UNK 4 i am leaving UNK college students whose teacher i am STOP 
START a UNK UNK on this is that most of my students have UNK from the draft in order to attend my classes STOP 
START at this late date it is impossible for st. UNK college to find a suitable replacement for me STOP 
START even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally UNK for the second time for no very UNK reason i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket UNK standing UNK on the street corners and in the UNK of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone mad STOP 
START UNK term of honor news UNK i consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the katanga army referred to as mercenaries STOP 
START this UNK me no end STOP 
START if the UNK troops sent here UNK by the UNK government to fight for england in the UNK were mercenaries what shall we call the un troops sent to the congo UNK by their governments to fight for the united nations the un troops are not mercenaries then the UNK were not mercenaries either STOP 
START and if the foreigners fighting in the katanga army are mercenaries then lafayette and UNK UNK were mercenaries too as were also the members of the lafayette UNK in the early part of world war 1 and of UNK flying UNK in the early days of world war 2 STOP 
START modern UNK UNK it doesn't take a UNK UNK to tell you what's wrong with UNK UNK UNK UNK objects july 1 STOP 
START it's an UNK negative man the following UNK amendment by moving the term republic to lower case UNK the modern phrase move ahead for the UNK keep and by using the UNK name on every envelope in UNK of course with the in spite as faded as possible the UNK cannot fail STOP 
START the UNK death of pope in the issue of march 5 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said on trial in UNK for having UNK for the UNK UNK UNK u.s. pilot UNK lawrence pope UNK told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of UNK STOP 
START facing a UNK which has demanded the death penalty he said i have participated in the war against communism in korea and at UNK and i have helped in the UNK of north UNK to the free world STOP 
START i have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by communist domination STOP 
START at least in UNK khrushchev found an american proud to be at total war with communism then nothing has happened to save the life of pope STOP 
START i found recently a very small article in the new york times u.s. UNK loses plea STOP 
START UNK court UNK UNK death sentence STOP 
START UNK military supreme court has confirmed the death sentence passed on UNK lawrence pope an american pilot STOP 
START pope was convicted last year of having aided north UNK rebels by flying UNK missions STOP 
START he has been in prison since may 1958 when his aircraft was shot down over UNK STOP 
START he may appeal to president UNK for UNK STOP 
START as we see pope may appeal to president UNK khrushchev's friend for UNK STOP 
START this possibility is anything but UNK STOP 
START the UNK roosevelt tractor committee acts on behalf of the cuban freedom fighters STOP 
START but who will act now and immediately to save the life of UNK pope UNK available for him anybody think of saving the life of an UNK american pilot analogy a few days before i saw your mention of what texas liberals were doing to promote louis UNK the week june 3 another analogy had occurred to me STOP

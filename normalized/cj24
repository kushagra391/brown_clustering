START UNK with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income her defense of denial was UNK strong STOP 
START thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in UNK for two babies showed signs of becoming a UNK problem STOP 
START the result UNK visible in a matter of days in the UNK UNK daily functioning was a UNK fear that some terrible harm would UNK the second UNK whose birth had not been anticipated STOP 
START soon mrs. UNK fears threatened to burst into a UNK panic concerning the welfare of the entire family STOP 
START inability to care for the other children difficulty in feeding the babies who seemed UNK UNK fatigue repeated crying UNK and short UNK reflected the UNK UNK in UNK with the UNK situation STOP 
START clearly this was a family in crisis STOP 
START mrs. b. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and UNK at the time of her mother's death when she was eight as well as her subsequent anger at her father for UNK STOP 
START her previous UNK experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday STOP 
START on the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with UNK tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral STOP 
START in the UNK own words during the third of twelve visits they had reached the crisis peak either the situation will give or we will break confrontation and acceptance of mrs. UNK anger against the second baby soon UNK her fears of UNK STOP 
START UNK of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss UNK and UNK produced further relief of tension STOP 
START in a joint interview mr. and mrs. b. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger UNK UNK away from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins STOP 
START the father accurately UNK the child's needs not only respected them as worthy of his attention but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins saying i have a big lap is room for you too johnnie STOP 
START simultaneously a variety of UNK supports a calm but not too UNK UNK UNK for temporary economic aid intelligent use of nursing care UNK to the UNK UNK for medical advice on the UNK feeding problem combined to prevent further development of UNK UNK mechanisms STOP 
START UNK visits of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the UNK UNK mental health and social functioning STOP 
START as seen in the b. family there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance STOP 
START the lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety often assuming the UNK UNK of not knowing or not UNK STOP 
START the UNK use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled UNK STOP 
START in general the approach is more active than passive more UNK than UNK STOP 
START while some UNK is inevitable it is discouraged rather than encouraged so that the UNK does not follow the stages of planned UNK associated with certain casework UNK of the UNK model for insight therapy STOP 
START to establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential UNK immediately preferably within the first interview by meeting the UNK specific needs STOP 
START these needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension STOP 
START the initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely UNK in an UNK sense STOP 
START in this UNK stage the worker must communicate confidence in the UNK ability to deal with the problem STOP 
START in so doing he UNK offers the positive UNK of hope as a kind of UNK dynamic to UNK feelings of UNK and UNK generally associated with the first stages of stress impact STOP 
START thus the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on his own behalf STOP 
START here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more UNK sense to any casework situation STOP 
START we are UNK or UNK UNK phenomena such as undue UNK UNK UNK and UNK excessive use of denial and UNK guilt turned against the self STOP 
START while some UNK and some denial are not only necessary but healthy the UNK clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used what healthy shifts in defensive UNK are indicated and when efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively UNK STOP 
START in UNK the family toward UNK and away from UNK responses the worker uses UNK focused casework techniques of specific emotional support UNK and UNK guidance STOP 
START over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve weeks the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth between immediate external UNK UNK UNK stress and the key emotionally relevant issues underlying problem which are often in a dramatic UNK UNK UNK by the crisis situation and hence once again UNK to resolution STOP 
START though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques they do challenge the UNK skill to UNK them precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate UNK UNK STOP 
START then too the UNK clinical flexibility is necessary in UNK UNK carefully UNK UNK home visits single and group office interviews and appropriate telephone UNK calls if the worker is to be UNK UNK and if the predicted UNK outcome is to be actually UNK in accordance with the principles of preventive intervention STOP 
START in addition in many cases a variety of concrete social resources UNK day care medical and financial aid must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to UNK the family in its individual and collective UNK and UNK efforts STOP 
START at certain critical stages and only for sound UNK reasons it may be important to UNK family members in their use of these resources if their UNK behavior is to be constructive rather than UNK STOP 
START while expensive in time and involving a great deal of UNK on the part of the worker in terms of his willingness to leave the UNK of his office and enter actively into the UNK life techniques of UNK were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives STOP 
START finally whatever the techniques used a UNK goal is common to all preventive casework service to UNK or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family members to UNK and use their ego UNK STOP 
START having UNK an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we now address ourselves to our final question what place should brief UNK preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services should first recognize our tendency to develop a UNK of values UNK brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top instead of seeing the services as part of a UNK each important in its own right STOP 
START this problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself STOP 
START almost three decades ago UNK UNK UNK a study of UNK UNK because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social services STOP 
START her conclusion has been UNK out in the experience of many UNK UNK UNK is neither a UNK nor a UNK experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work STOP 
START thus casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the quantity of time expended STOP 
START that we are UNK an UNK of interest in the many formulations and preventive UNK of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature STOP 
START especially UNK is UNK finding that the length of treatment per UNK is not a reliable UNK of successful outcome STOP 
START according to a number of studies the important UNK are the nature and management of the UNK anxiety as well as the UNK of the helping person STOP 
START for example the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for UNK relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance UNK where the hours spent in purely UNK study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project STOP 
START of startling significance too is the UNK that it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent UNK rate as compared with a rate of UNK percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in UNK operated child guidance services STOP 
START these reports refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance UNK approached by the customary route of voluntary UNK by the family or by other professional people STOP 
START UNK to the approach which i have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship quick UNK of key issues and the immediate UNK of treatment plans as the essential UNK in helping to further the UNK UNK efforts in dealing with the UNK of inner and outer stresses STOP 
START while there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional UNK all point up the importance of an immediate response to the UNK initial need for help STOP 
START in some programs treatment is concentrated over a short period of time while in others after the initial contact is established flexible UNK of interviews has been UNK used with apparent success STOP 
START willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation with the UNK that if the interpretation is too threatening the worker can UNK is another prominent feature in these efforts STOP 
START my aim in UNK this factor obviously is not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage us to use the UNK clinical casework skills we already possess and to use them with greater confidence precision and professional pride STOP 
START though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary or perhaps in some instances primary level the place of short-term intervention has already been UNK by a number of investigators in a wide variety of UNK STOP 
START UNK for example has emphasized the need for a broad spectrum of services including very brief services in connection with critical situations STOP 
START UNK brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice rather than as a treatment of chance STOP 
START moreover the shortage of treatment resources and the UNK persistent shortage of mental health manpower force us to UNK additional UNK of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available and on a more effective basis to more people STOP 
START further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the UNK of traditional social casework services including attempts to develop a UNK of family structures crisis problems reaction mechanisms and differential treatment approaches and the establishment of new experimental programs are UNK social needs which should command the best efforts of UNK in collaboration with community planners STOP 
START our literature is already UNK with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency UNK ranging from the immediately practical to the UNK utopian STOP 
START probably in the immediate future we will have to settle for UNK efforts that fall short of utopian models STOP 
START increased experimentation with UNK agencies especially those that combine UNK the traditional functions of family and child welfare services holds rich promise for the future STOP 
START for example child welfare experience UNK with cases in which the UNK request for substitute care is UNK by a crisis event which is UNK linked with a fundamental UNK problem of family relationships STOP

START there were fences in the old days when we were children STOP 
START across the front of a yard and down the side they were iron either UNK along the top or arched in half circles STOP 
START UNK fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the UNK that grew in a line against them STOP 
START side fences were hidden beneath UNK and UNK UNK fences were covered with virginia UNK or UNK UNK or UNK STOP 
START square UNK and gate posts were an UNK pattern of UNK foliage were UNK by UNK complete in every detail UNK roof UNK and narrow UNK STOP 
START on these posts the gates swung open with a UNK and shut with a UNK UNK STOP 
START the only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper UNK of the UNK tree STOP 
START the primary quality of that view seems now to have been its UNK but that cannot at the time have impressed us STOP 
START what one actually remembers is its UNK STOP 
START from high in the tree the whole block lay within range of the eye but the ground was almost nowhere visible STOP 
START one looked down on a sea of leaves a breaking wave of flower STOP 
START every path from back door to barn was covered by a UNK and every yard had its fruit trees STOP 
START in the center of any open space remaining our UNK had planted UNK and UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea a UNK UNK skirt UNK into sight for an instant on the path beneath her UNK or the movement of hands above a UNK and the UNK of UNK hung there UNK down the block STOP 
START that was one UNK the UNK UNK STOP 
START another had ended before it began STOP 
START time is a UNK thing and memory a UNK UNK that time plays with memory and memory with time are UNK of all STOP 
START from maturity one looks back at the succession of years counts them and makes them many yet cannot feel length in the number however large STOP 
START in a stream that turns a UNK there is a lot of water UNK is quiet its surface dark and UNK and there does not seem to be much water in it STOP 
START time in the sum is nothing STOP 
START and yet a year to a child is an UNK and in the memory that phase of one's being a certain mental landscape will seem to have endured without beginning and without end STOP 
START the part of the mind that preserves dates and events may UNK it could have been like that for only a little while true memory does not count nor add it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time STOP 
START once then for how many years or how few does not matter my world was bound round by fences when i was too small to reach the UNK tree UNK to twist my knee over it and pull myself up STOP 
START that world was in scale with my own UNK STOP 
START i have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole that i could not see but certain aspects of certain corners UNK in the memory UNK UNK white UNK beneath a window with their UNK brown leaves and their sharp UNK of november UNK lying in long grass to be turned over by a UNK foot UNK lest bees still worked in the UNK UNK holes UNK in the corner between the UNK wall and the side porch where we passed on our way to the pump with the UNK tied to it as a cup by my UNK for our childish pleasure in drinking from it STOP 
START it was mother who planted the UNK STOP 
START i think that my UNK was not an UNK UNK she was too UNK a lover of dogs and UNK STOP 
START my UNK i have been told made her garden her great pride cherished rare and delicate plants like UNK in UNK and UNK and lemon UNK in UNK that had to be UNK in the cellar filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden UNK in a corner by the UNK and the UNK UNK along the west side of the house STOP 
START these my UNK left in their places they are still there more persistent and UNK than the generations of man and planted others like them that UNK without careful UNK STOP 
START three of these only were protected from us by stern UNK the UNK whose UNK might not be collected until they had fallen to be made into UNK or UNK to drink UNK whose tight UNK UNK would be UNK by the laying on of a finger although they were not apparently UNK by the UNK that crawled over them the UNK STOP 
START i have more than once sat UNK in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a UNK UNK higher than my head slowly but UNK pushed off its cap UNK and shook out like a UNK in the sun its UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START other flowers we might gather as we pleased UNK and white UNK from beneath the UNK UNK themselves that UNK so UNK but for the most part beyond our reach UNK that turned UNK down make UNK ladies the little dark blue UNK that scattered its seed everywhere STOP 
START more UNK a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a UNK of the UNK which are of the very stuff of the mind UNK because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them STOP 
START flowers stones and small creatures living and dead STOP 
START pale yellow UNK that by UNK could be made to UNK of the UNK that snapped like UNK at a touch UNK whose UNK UNK were picked off and eaten for the honey in them UNK which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a UNK paper bag flowers from the UNK UNK that made UNK on the ends of ten UNK fingers STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK with their sensitive UNK struggling UNK held by their long UNK legs and commanded to spit tobacco spit STOP 
START dead UNK birds their UNK UNK and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our UNK in front of the purple UNK STOP 
START and the cast shell of a UNK UNK and transparent UNK nothing UNK but entire with eyes like bubbles and a UNK UNK down its back STOP 
START every morning early in the summer we UNK the UNK of the trees as high as we could reach for the UNK shells carefully detached their UNK UNK from the bark where they hung and UNK them a UNK UNK herd in an angle between the high roots of the UNK tree where no grass grew in the UNK shade STOP 
START we collected lucky stones all the UNK UNK UNK worn smooth and round that we could find in the driveway STOP 
START when these had been UNK we could still spend a morning cracking open other UNK for our delight in seeing how much UNK they were inside than their dull UNK indicated STOP 
START we showed them to each other and said would you have guessed on our UNK beside the flat stone we broke them on we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive safe from UNK and the observation and possible UNK of the UNK STOP 
START thus UNK we played many foolish games in comfortable UNK when the fences became a part of the game when a UNK UNK was the sleeping UNK UNK UNK or when UNK let down her golden hair from beneath the UNK UNK even then we paid little UNK to those who went by on the path outside STOP 
START we enjoyed a UNK freedom when we were still too young for school STOP 
START in the heat of the summer the garden UNK were ours alone UNK stayed in the dark house or sat UNK on the front porch STOP 
START they never troubled themselves about us while we were playing because the fence formed such a definite boundary and don't go outside the gate was a command so impossible of UNK STOP 
START we were not however entirely UNK with the varying aspects of the street STOP 
START we were forbidden to swing on the gates lest they UNK on their UNK in a UNK way but we could stand on them when they were UNK rest our UNK on the top and stare and stare UNK to memory quite UNK all the details that lay before our eyes STOP 
START the street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years UNK on an august afternoon in the shade of the UNK trees and silence was a weight almost UNK in the air STOP 
START every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again UNK beneath it STOP 
START a UNK moved slowly along the UNK the top of it swept by the low UNK of the UNK trees and loose UNK were left hanging UNK among the leaves STOP 
START a wheel UNK on a UNK was still and UNK again STOP 
START if a child watched its progress he whispered hay hay load of hay make a wish and turn away and then stared UNK in the opposite direction until the sound of the UNK feet returned no more STOP 
START when the hay wagon had gone and an interval passed a UNK UNK might turn the corner STOP 
START the horse walked the UNK were UNK the UNK rode with UNK shoulders his UNK across his knees STOP 
START UNK as if UNK to break the silence he lifted his voice UNK nice fresh UNK today UNK UNK was UNK in time like the UNK of a UNK STOP 
START no one seemed to hear him no one UNK STOP 
START the horse UNK on and he repeated his call STOP 
START it became so UNK as to seem a part of the UNK STOP 
START after his passage the street was empty again STOP 
START the sun moved UNK across the sky and down UNK shadows UNK from street to sidewalk from sidewalk to lawn STOP 
START at UNK or UNK the coming of the UNK marked the end of the day tossed a paper toward every front door and UNK came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing STOP 
START the streets of any county town were like this on any UNK afternoon in summer were like this UNK years ago and yesterday STOP 
START but the fences were still in place UNK years ago and when we stood on the gate to look over the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of UNK stones with grass between and on both sides STOP 
START the curb was a line of stone laid UNK in the dirt and tilted this way and that by UNK in the ground or the roots of trees STOP 
START opposite every gate was a UNK post or a stone UNK set with a UNK iron ring for UNK a horse STOP 
START the street was UNK and rose UNK toward the center was mud in wet weather and dust UNK in dry and could be crossed only at the corner where there were UNK stones STOP 
START it had a UNK atmosphere that it has lost long since STOP 
START the UNK of cattle and the UNK of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the UNK of UNK horses STOP 
START cows were kept in UNK UNK boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town and familiar to the ear morning and evening were the UNK UNK voices the UNK of UNK and the UNK of a stick on UNK STOP

START sales and net income for the year ended december 31 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 STOP 
START net income was UNK or UNK per share on UNK common shares currently outstanding as compared to UNK or UNK per share in 1959 adjusted to the same number of shares STOP 
START sales and other operating income increased UNK from UNK in 1959 to UNK in 1960 STOP 
START this increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development STOP 
START in spite of the fact that our largest market the textile industry was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate UNK higher than during 1959 STOP 
START outlook for current year our current rate of UNK orders has now UNK and unless this trend can be UNK our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 STOP 
START however the healthy inventory position of the textile industry UNK support to the UNK expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 STOP 
START need for sound tax policy in connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery a UNK u. s. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis could if adopted have favorable effects on UNK business in the next few years STOP 
START such a depreciation policy would also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the u. s. textile and other industries thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange STOP 
START research and development our research and development program serving as it does an industry which must compete against UNK production throughout the world continues to have primary emphasis at UNK STOP 
START this program is based on the policy of UNK and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values fabrics whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money STOP 
START such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment in terms of efficiency and UNK STOP 
START but more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the UNK UNK UNK and our more recent UNK automatic UNK machine STOP 
START budget increased on this basis our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to UNK future growth in sales and earnings STOP 
START much of this necessary increase in research and development though properly UNK to current expenses is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity usually over a period of several years STOP 
START stretch yarn machines in december we began to ship our UNK stretch yarn machines STOP 
START these machines produce the higher quality stretch UNK required in UNK stretch and UNK fabrics STOP 
START during the past year great progress has been made by the UNK mills in creating new stretch and UNK fabrics STOP 
START fashion centers are now UNK broad acceptance of sports UNK and improved wash and wear UNK and UNK made from these fabrics STOP 
START this machine operating at speeds up to UNK UNK per minute is believed to provide one of the UNK mechanical operations in industry today STOP 
START it transfers yarn directly from the UNK largest package into ideal supply UNK for use on UNK UNK UNK in UNK stretch yarn fabrics STOP 
START UNK UNK our new UNK ring UNK for glass fiber UNK is performing well in our UNK mills STOP 
START later in the year additional types of this UNK UNK will be made available to mills for other UNK fibers and natural UNK STOP 
START these machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds larger yarn UNK and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn STOP 
START this we believe will substantially UNK the potential market for the equipment STOP 
START UNK major activity at providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of UNK for production of the UNK automatic UNK machine STOP 
START this work is UNK on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year STOP 
START this machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery UNK last year and was well received by the industry STOP 
START the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK has several outstanding features it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment UNK an automatic UNK device on each UNK and it will UNK a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new UNK as the running end is exhausted STOP 
START because the UNK UNK process is a relatively UNK operation for the mill the almost complete UNK provided by the UNK can mean important UNK in textile production at the same time UNK quality STOP 
START many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine STOP 
START new UNK application a new application for the UNK UNK UNK running single filling for box UNK will UNK mill use of this equipment STOP 
START UNK machines a new spinning UNK machine has been developed to UNK the use of our UNK machine in the production of UNK UNK STOP 
START it is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed STOP 
START this new machine takes up UNK yarn from UNK or UNK and winds large UNK at speeds up to UNK feet per minute STOP 
START it is equipped with an automatic UNK device to reduce waste and handling time STOP 
START our UNK machines and our UNK are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high UNK UNK in several fiber producing plants STOP 
START we look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field STOP 
START UNK plans we are interested in further UNK into other fields of capital goods or components for industrial products and have recently UNK our efforts in that direction STOP 
START UNK UNK research our UNK UNK research division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells STOP 
START the cooperation of our exclusive american UNK UNK UNK aircraft division of united aircraft corporation has been important in this work STOP 
START in addition to its major effort on fuel cells UNK UNK research division is continuing to carry on research in other fields both under contract for the defense department other government agencies and for our own account STOP 
START UNK is currently supplying components vital to the UNK and UNK programs STOP 
START we have recently entered into an agreement with UNK UNK de UNK UNK UNK UNK of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on UNK materials STOP 
START the agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the united states STOP 
START initially we will import the UNK materials and UNK from france but later we will manufacture in this country STOP 
START there is a rapidly growing demand for this material primarily from the military STOP 
START further research we believe will develop important commercial applications STOP 
START a project for the air force has been completed in which the UNK infrared UNK device was developed for area monitoring of UNK or dangerous UNK STOP 
START we are UNK research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity STOP 
START the rapid advance in science today suggests many other UNK of investigation STOP 
START our plan is to keep UNK of these advances and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities STOP 
START new plant facilities early in august we broke ground for a new UNK plant in warwick rhode island which will house our textile and UNK UNK machinery operations STOP 
START construction is well along and the plant is scheduled for completion in november of this year STOP 
START all operations now carried on at our plant at cranston will be transferred to warwick STOP 
START operations in the new plant should be producing UNK early in 1962 STOP 
START an UNK sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover STOP 
START the building will contain UNK square feet approximately the same as our present plant STOP 
START however its modern UNK UNK is designed to increase our production capacity permit more efficient manufacturing and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs STOP 
START a major consideration in the choice of the warwick site four miles from cranston was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force STOP 
START we have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present cranston properties effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant STOP 
START british UNK during the year our british UNK UNK limited expanded its plant in UNK england and added machine tool capacity STOP 
START the operations of its other plant in UNK and UNK former operations in manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of UNK STOP 
START UNK and equipment were UNK and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis STOP 
START the area available at UNK is approximately three times the size of the former UNK and manchester locations STOP 
START in addition land has been purchased to permit UNK the size of the plant in the future STOP 
START financial developments the new warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction STOP 
START it will be UNK on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a UNK organization which will UNK us for the cost of construction STOP 
START we will then occupy the new plant under UNK with an UNK to purchase STOP 
START these arrangements are in our opinion very favorable to UNK STOP 
START interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from the chase manhattan bank STOP 
START in addition to expenditures on the warwick plant we have invested approximately UNK for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at UNK limited STOP 
START we believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment STOP 
START long term loans have been reduced by UNK to UNK STOP 
START inventories increased UNK to UNK during the year and should decline in coming months STOP 
START thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position STOP 
START employee contracts in accordance with the UNK contract signed in may 1959 with the international association of UNK UNK wages of UNK employees were increased by UNK in may 1960 and pay levels for UNK UNK employees were increased UNK STOP 
START in addition blue cross coverage for all employees and their UNK was extended to provide the full cost of UNK hospital UNK STOP 
START personnel benefits in addition to direct UNK and wages the company paid or UNK during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees during the pension year ended december 31 1960 23 employees retired making a total of UNK currently retired under the company's pension plan STOP 
START at december 13 1960 the fund held by the industrial national bank of providence as UNK for payment of past and future service UNK to qualified members of the plan UNK UNK STOP 
START the basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago STOP 
START another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living STOP 
START as in many other industries rising costs and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years STOP 
START increased efficiency in textiles as elsewhere a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity STOP 
START as a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery UNK and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility STOP 
START problems of shifting styles the problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in UNK or home UNK STOP 
START production must be adjusted accordingly at minimum cost and quickly STOP 
START in addition production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of UNK as well as UNK STOP

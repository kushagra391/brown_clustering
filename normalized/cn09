START UNK she found exactly the right statement STOP 
START she began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him STOP 
START i want to tell you something thomas UNK lord STOP 
START i'm well aware that you've got a UNK as long as my leg and that i don't amount to anything STOP 
START but but it don't matter UNK lord supplied UNK STOP 
START to me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams UNK the UNK flower that grows STOP 
START UNK UNK he UNK out his lips and attempted to kiss her STOP 
START she UNK away from him furiously STOP 
START you shut up UNK got something to say to you and by god you're going to listen STOP 
START do you hear me going to listen nodded UNK STOP 
START he said he wanted very much to listen STOP 
START he knew that anything a UNK little lady like her had to say would be UNK important as well as UNK to the ear and he didn't want to miss a word of it STOP 
START so would she mind speaking a little louder i think you UNK tom lord think you're mean and UNK and stupid and louder joyce STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START so i can hear you while i'm UNK the car STOP 
START looks like we might be in for a UNK of trouble STOP 
START he opened the door and got out STOP 
START he waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her UNK STOP 
START well you UNK to say UNK UNK as she merely stared at him in weary silence maybe you could write it down for me UNK it in real big letters UNK i can UNK it out later STOP 
START UNK go on she said STOP 
START just go the hell on STOP 
START he grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car STOP 
START lips UNK UNK he stared down at its UNK UNK left side STOP 
START then he UNK down on the heels of his UNK boots peered into the orderly chaos of UNK shock UNK and spring STOP 
START he went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination STOP 
START after a time he straightened again UNK the red UNK dust from his hands UNK it from his UNK UNK and his UNK UNK shirt STOP 
START he wore no gun a strange UNK for a peace officer in this country STOP 
START never he'd once told joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun STOP 
START and he really feels that way she thought STOP 
START that's really all he's got all he is STOP 
START just a big pile of UNK in an almost UNK package STOP 
START if i could make myself feel the same way she studied him UNK UNK the UNK background of sky and UNK it was easy to confirm her analysis STOP 
START here in the UNK place the UNK end of nowhere tom lord looked almost UNK almost UNK STOP 
START he was handsome with his UNK hair and eyes his UNK features STOP 
START but she'd known plenty of UNK guys and UNK his good looks what was there left wasn't a big man on the medium side STOP 
START neither was he very powerful of build STOP 
START he could move very quickly she knew although he seldom found occasion to do so but he was more UNK than truly strong STOP 
START and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance STOP 
START just nothing she told herself STOP 
START just so UNK sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on everyone STOP 
START but by UNK i want him and i'm going to have him caught her eye came back around the car with the UNK UNK walk STOP 
START why did these UNK still wear boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years slid in at her side UNK a UNK into his mouth and UNK UNK one to her STOP 
START oh cut it out tom snapped STOP 
START can't you stop that stupid UNK for even a minute this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested STOP 
START or maybe you just don't feel like a UNK i feel like getting back to town that's what i feel like are you going to take me or am i supposed to walk might get there faster UNK lord UNK UNK as how i got a UNK front spring STOP 
START on the other hand UNK maybe you wouldn't either STOP 
START i UNK it's UNK a UNK walk and i UNK maybe get this spring UNK up in a couple of hours STOP 
START how with what nothing out here but UNK STOP 
START now ain't it the truth laughed with secret UNK STOP 
START not a UNK thing but UNK so i UNK i'll get the boss UNK to help me STOP 
START tom god's sake UNK STOP 
START he pointed cutting her off STOP 
START see that UNK saw it then the distant UNK of the UNK a test well in UNK country STOP 
START and even with her limited knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired there at least to get them back into town STOP 
START a UNK had to be prepared for almost any emergency STOP 
START he had to depend on himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others STOP 
START well let's get going she said UNK STOP 
START i she broke off frowning STOP 
START what did you mean by that UNK UNK the boss UNK to help you why i meant what i said lord declared STOP 
START what else would i mean UNK looked at him lips UNK STOP 
START then with a UNK of UNK indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her UNK STOP 
START in his mood it was the best way to handle him is to show no curiosity UNK STOP 
START otherwise she would be UNK into a UNK UNK and UNK until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle in the UNK struggle of tom lord vs. joyce UNK STOP 
START the car UNK along at a UNK crawl the UNK UNK UNK and UNK against the tire occasionally UNK against the road itself STOP 
START lord UNK UNK as he fought the UNK wheel STOP 
START he seemed very pleased with himself as though some UNK scheme was working out exactly as he had planned STOP 
START along with this UNK however joyce sensed a growing tension STOP 
START it poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his UNK body were UNK for action and that that action would be all that he anticipated STOP 
START joyce had seen him like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion STOP 
START that was the day that he had practically UNK up the main street of big UNK with UNK mcbride field boss for the UNK oil gas company STOP 
START tom had been laying for UNK mcbride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of line STOP 
START mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his UNK STOP 
START he had a legitimate reason for wearing it STOP 
START it was UNK for UNK and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields STOP 
START moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the UNK office had made no previous issue of it STOP 
START so what's this all about demanded when lord confronted him STOP 
START i'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit STOP 
START it was the wrong thing to say STOP 
START by failing to do as he was told instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to his car he had played into lord's hands STOP 
START the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest STOP 
START the deputy had forced him to by his manner of UNK him STOP 
START so how about it said STOP 
START why single me out on this permit deal well i'll tell you about that lord told him STOP 
START we aim UNK be UNK UNK like to bother no one unless we have to which i UNK we do in your case STOP 
START UNK we got to be UNK careful with any of you UNK big shots STOP 
START mcbride UNK STOP 
START he himself had heard that there was UNK money in the company but that had nothing to do with him STOP 
START he was an honest man doing a hard job and the UNK that he was anything else was UNK STOP 
START look lord he said UNK STOP 
START i know you've got a UNK against me and maybe i can't blame you STOP 
START you think that UNK UNK you and i helped 'em do it STOP 
START but you're all wrong man no lawyer STOP 
START i just do what i'm told and UNK STOP 
START UNK that could mean trouble with a UNK that's UNK for UNK STOP 
START so you get rid of that pistol right now UNK mcbride STOP 
START you do that or take you out a permit right now STOP 
START mcbride couldn't do either of course STOP 
START not immediately as the deputy demanded STOP 
START not without a UNK UNK of at least a few minutes STOP 
START to do so would make his job UNK impossible STOP 
START UNK workers were a UNK lot STOP 
START how could he exert authority over them make them UNK the line as he had to if he UNK under to this UNK UNK i'll get around to it a little later he UNK desperately STOP 
START just as soon as i go to the bank and UNK STOP 
START now UNK mcbride said lord and he laid a firmly UNK hand on the field UNK arm STOP 
START it was strictly the UNK game but mcbride had gone too far to throw in STOP 
START now he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's UNK deck STOP 
START he flung off lord's hand and attempted to push past him UNK UNK him into a UNK STOP 
START it was practically the last move that mcbride made of his own UNK STOP 
START lord UNK him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his UNK STOP 
START then as he doubled UNK UNK the breakfast he had so lately eaten lord straightened him with an UNK STOP 
START a rabbit UNK UNK him STOP 
START and then there was a UNK blow to the heart and another UNK blow to the stomach but he couldn't keep up with them STOP 
START no more could he defend himself against them STOP 
START he seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen STOP 
START and he could no longer think of UNK of honor but only of escape STOP 
START why he's going to kill me he thought wildly STOP 
START i meant him no harm STOP 
START i've given UNK hurt to no man STOP 
START i was just doing my job just following orders and for that he's going to kill me STOP 
START beat me to death in front of a hundred people STOP 
START somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go UNK STOP 
START he mcbride would be cited as in the wrong and he lord would go UNK an officer who had only done his duty though perhaps too UNK STOP 
START mcbride staggered into the street UNK UNK in the UNK dust STOP 
START UNK UNK the UNK shadow of death he UNK to his feet again STOP 
START he couldn't see was long past the point of UNK thinking STOP 
START dimly he heard laughter UNK of UNK but he could not read the UNK properly STOP 
START he could not grasp that lord had UNK from the fight minutes ago and that his UNK arms were UNK at nothing but the air STOP 
START he hated them too much to understand the people of this isolated UNK world that was lord's world STOP 
START this he was sure was the way they would act at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death STOP 
START and nothing would be done about it STOP 
START nothing unless UNK his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him STOP 
START UNK was like he was STOP 
START she lived by the rules never UNK never UNK or UNK by circumstance STOP 
START and UNK would when he UNK consciousness he was in lord's house in the office of doctor lord the UNK UNK father STOP

START through a door UNK unlocked madden UNK STOP 
START that damn door said the police chief STOP 
START a gift horse to be viewed with suspicion STOP 
START UNK dark face wore a UNK look STOP 
START if there was UNK between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary UNK to check on the door later STOP 
START and it makes a very poor red UNK for an inside job STOP 
START much better to break a cellar window STOP 
START don't forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death UNK reminded him STOP 
START well with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation STOP 
START yeah STOP 
START and a UNK of glass isn't hard to the telephone interrupted him STOP 
START he UNK up the receiver and said police chief into the UNK and then oh yes mr. benson STOP 
START i was hoping i'd hear from you today STOP 
START with his free hand he pulled a UNK and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying UNK and i see at intervals STOP 
START at last he said well thank you for calling mr. benson STOP 
START although there was no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one i'm glad to have it made official STOP 
START he hung up STOP 
START UNK he said to madden STOP 
START he's just heard from the UNK who says mrs. UNK apparently died from UNK STOP 
START UNK looked at his notes STOP 
START many minute UNK in the lungs of UNK and thread in the mouth and UNK STOP 
START UNK from the bed UNK identical with the UNK and thread found in the UNK and oral UNK STOP 
START no other cause of death apparent STOP 
START UNK clear of UNK and foreign objects STOP 
START brain examined for UNK UNK or UNK STOP 
START no signs of these no gross UNK of lungs heart brain or stomach STOP 
START he paused STOP 
START that's about it STOP 
START oh the time of death STOP 
START the duration of the UNK process varies the UNK says but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper UNK tract indicate that mrs. UNK died several hours after her UNK dinner STOP 
START probably around midnight give or take an hour either way STOP 
START UNK paused again STOP 
START so there it is he said STOP 
START not your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer are one and the same STOP 
START they discussed this possibility STOP 
START however likely it was UNK said he couldn't limit himself to it STOP 
START he had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to johnston came to light STOP 
START madden with his investigation centered on the UNK said that tomorrow he would go to the UNK bank through which mrs. UNK checks to johnston had cleared STOP 
START arthur williams had to be located they agreed STOP 
START he might have been in UNK with johnston on the UNK might be mrs. UNK murderer or have played some part in her death STOP 
START this was UNK suggestion police chief shook his head over it STOP 
START if arthur williams was involved in the UNK or the murder then he too had another identity STOP 
START no one the UNK police had questioned UNK to know any more about him than about johnston STOP 
START scholarship UNK looked doubtful STOP 
START madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to mrs. UNK STOP 
START then he asked to use the phone and called UNK thayer who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock STOP 
START madden said that he would see him at two and made another call this one to mrs. UNK lawyers STOP 
START mr. UNK was out for the day but mr. garth would be free at UNK STOP 
START the UNK tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a UNK for which madden should be UNK grateful STOP 
START he UNK that UNK and garth were UNK lawyers STOP 
START he had lunch with UNK STOP 
START promptly at UNK he entered UNK and UNK elegant suite of offices in UNK newest professional building STOP 
START he disliked garth on sight conservative clothes and UNK smile a shade too earnestly UNK for a man who must be well into his UNK UNK too consciously quick and firm STOP 
START UNK man on the make madden UNK him and was ready to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions mrs. garth would be UNK suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer there were three children two boys and a girl she was active in the woman's club and he in UNK UNK and UNK finally that neither of them had UNK an UNK opinion since their wedding day STOP 
START madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this but also knew that he would go right on UNK garth STOP 
START garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with UNK UNK as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs. UNK had only seen fit to consult mr. UNK or him about it STOP 
START madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement STOP 
START he asked to see a copy of mrs. UNK will STOP 
START garth brought one out STOP 
START the date october 8 1957 immediately caught the UNK eye STOP 
START fairly recent he remarked STOP 
START was she in the habit of making new UNK oh no STOP 
START she had reason to change the one she made right after mr. UNK death STOP 
START her estate had grown considerably STOP 
START she wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most the scholarship fund STOP 
START at the time the will was drawn mr. UNK mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth STOP 
START garth hesitated STOP 
START mr. UNK and i have noticed some UNK since though STOP 
START most of them this past year i'd say STOP 
START even two or three years ago i doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate johnston affair STOP 
START she'd have consulted us you see STOP 
START she always did before and showed the UNK confidence in whatever we advised STOP 
START the inspector nodded UNK this STOP 
START mrs. UNK hadn't struck him as ready to seek UNK advice least of all UNK STOP 
START with her sharp tongue she'd have cut his UNK to UNK STOP 
START it would have been UNK who handled her affairs STOP 
START madden settled back to read the will STOP 
START he UNK over the millions that went to UNK park UNK hospital the civic center the public health nursing association the library and so on UNK when he came to the scholarship fund STOP 
START two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in mrs. UNK UNK and the UNK made that as long as UNK thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees UNK appointed by the bank UNK the estate he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary UNK with the increased responsibilities UNK of the fund would UNK STOP 
START a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflected STOP 
START tenure too STOP 
START very nice for him STOP 
START he went on to personal UNK a list of names largely unknown to him STOP 
START twenty-five thousand to each of the UNK in oregon not much to blood relatives out of millions ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another UNK thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars the UNK ten thousand each joan UNK the UNK UNK of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in mrs. UNK employ at the time of the UNK death STOP 
START no additional five thousand for each year after UNK UNK birthday UNK hadn't got around to taking care of that STOP 
START too bad madden thought STOP 
START joan UNK had earned the larger UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK was left twenty thousand garth ten STOP 
START there were no other names madden recognized STOP 
START arthur UNK might well have been included he felt STOP 
START mrs. UNK had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers STOP 
START madden took up this point with garth who shrugged it off STOP 
START old people have their UNK STOP 
START this one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more STOP 
START well she had a number of them where money was concerned garth said STOP 
START sometimes we'd have trouble UNK her to make UNK UNK contributions and i've known her to quarrel with a UNK over a bill for fixing a UNK next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as UNK as this unfortunate johnston affair STOP 
START there was no telling how she'd react to spending money STOP 
START madden inquired next about the UNK of the scholarship fund STOP 
START there was an annual UNK garth informed him STOP 
START no UNK or UNK had ever been found STOP 
START UNK thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator STOP 
START his salary had reached the ten thousand mark STOP 
START his expenses ran another four or five thousand STOP 
START the lawyer didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party thayer like himself madden reflected was the extra man so UNK by UNK and found him easy enough to talk to STOP 
START but he didn't play golf didn't seem to belong to any local clubs his work took him away a lot of course which probably UNK for his tendency to keep to himself STOP 
START UNK glance began to UNK to his watch STOP 
START he said that he had already told the police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended johnston to mrs. UNK STOP 
START he would offer no theory to account for her murder STOP 
START the whole thing his manner UNK was so far outside the normal routine of UNK and garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug STOP 
START no doubt mrs. UNK had UNK him many a time and he felt no UNK over her passing STOP 
START even so UNK dislike of the UNK correct lawyer UNK STOP 
START it would be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the UNK with its probable UNK of murder led to UNK door STOP 
START motive UNK STOP 
START at first glance not much of a motive for a man of his standing for all his air of UNK who could tell what his private financial picture was inspector knew as he left that this was UNK thinking STOP 
START nevertheless he made a mental note to look into UNK financial background STOP 
START UNK thayer had a downtown address STOP 
START he lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old a UNK island of UNK brick and glass on the fringe of the business district STOP 
START he occupied a UNK apartment on the fourth floor using the second bedroom as his office STOP 
START UNK and bright the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture UNK and UNK STOP 
START done by a professional UNK madden thought and somehow as impersonal as UNK as its UNK STOP 
START in UNK the rent would run close to two hundred a month UNK perhaps twenty-five less not all of it paid by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account STOP 
START he took madden into the room he used as an office STOP 
START it contained a desk files a UNK on a stand and two big leather UNK STOP 
START a newspaper open at UNK reports lay on one of them STOP 
START thayer folded it up and offered a drink STOP 
START the inspector declined STOP 
START to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston STOP 
START thayer shook his head STOP 
START it's all i think about too STOP 
START that and her death STOP 
START it's still UNK that it was murder STOP 
START for all her UNK ways i can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy STOP

START UNK STOP 
START UNK of binomial experiments some experiments are composed of UNK of independent trials each with two possible outcomes STOP 
START the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another STOP 
START we devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena but also because it has important properties that UNK in many other probability models STOP 
START we begin with a few examples of binomial experiments STOP 
START UNK example STOP 
START -hla trained UNK shooting five rounds at a target all under practically the same conditions may hit the UNK from 0 to 5 times STOP 
START in repeated sets of five shots his numbers of UNK vary STOP 
START what can we say of the probabilities of the different possible numbers of UNK in UNK STOP 
START -hlin UNK of eight UNK from similar parents the number of UNK with straight instead of UNK hair is an UNK from 0 to 8 STOP 
START what probabilities should be attached to these possible outcomes ones with three dice STOP 
START UNK three dice are tossed repeatedly what is the probability that the number of UNK is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 binomial problem STOP 
START UNK generally suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials that each trial results in either a success or a UNK failure and that the probability of success remains constant from trial to trial STOP 
START in the examples above the occurrence of a UNK a UNK UNK or an ace could be called a success STOP 
START in general any outcome we choose may be UNK success STOP 
START the major question in this chapter is what is the probability of exactly x successes in n trials chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples usually by counting points in a sample space STOP 
START fortunately a general formula of wide UNK UNK all problems of this kind STOP 
START before UNK this formula we explain what we mean by problems of this kind STOP 
START experiments are often composed of several identical trials and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated STOP 
START in the UNK example a trial consists of one round shot at a target with outcome either one UNK success or none failure STOP 
START further an experiment might consist of five rounds and several sets of five rounds might be regarded as a UNK composed of several UNK of the UNK experiment STOP 
START if three dice are tossed a trial is one UNK of one die and the experiment is composed of three trials STOP 
START or what amounts to the same thing if one die is tossed three times each UNK is a trial and the three UNK form the experiment STOP 
START UNK we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times STOP 
START these examples are UNK of the use of the words trial and experiment as they are used in this chapter but they are quite flexible words and it is well not to restrict them too UNK STOP 
START example 1 STOP 
START UNK football managers STOP 
START UNK students act as managers for a UNK football team and of these managers a proportion p are UNK drivers STOP 
START each friday one manager is chosen by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck STOP 
START on three UNK the coach has needed a driver STOP 
START considering only these UNK what is the probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times 2 times time times STOP 
START UNK that there are 3 trials of interest STOP 
START each trial consists of choosing a student manager at random STOP 
START the 2 possible outcomes on each trial are driver or UNK STOP 
START since the choice is by lot each week the outcomes of different trials are independent STOP 
START the managers stay the same so that af is the same for all weeks STOP 
START we now UNK these ideas for general binomial experiments STOP 
START for an experiment to qualify as a binomial experiment it must have four properties 1 there must be a fixed number of trials 2 each trial must result in a success or a failure a binomial trial 3 all trials must have identical probabilities of success 4 the trials must be independent of each other STOP 
START below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate these four properties STOP 
START we also give for each property an example where the property is absent STOP 
START the language and UNK introduced are standard throughout the chapter STOP 
START 1 STOP 
START -hlthere must be a fixed number n of repeated trials STOP 
START UNK the UNK we study sets of five shots af the UNK we restrict attention to UNK of eight af for the UNK we UNK three dice af STOP 
START experiment without a fixed number of trials STOP 
START UNK a die until an ace appears STOP 
START here the number of trials is a random variable not a fixed number STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK trials STOP 
START UNK of the n trials is either a success or a failure STOP 
START success and failure are just convenient UNK for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial trials in general STOP 
START these words are more UNK than UNK like a and UNK STOP 
START it is natural from the UNK viewpoint to call a UNK a success but in the UNK example it is arbitrary which category UNK to straight hair in a UNK STOP 
START the word binomial means of two names or of two terms and both UNK apply in our work the first to the names of the two outcomes of a binomial trial and the second to the terms p and af that represent the probabilities of success and failure STOP 
START sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial we group these outcomes into two classes as in the example of the die where we have UNK constructed the classes ace and UNK STOP 
START experiment without the UNK property STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK as UNK or UNK but a UNK UNK appears STOP 
START we can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the animal as not UNK a trial but such a solution is not always satisfactory STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK trials have identical probabilities of success STOP 
START UNK die has probability af of producing an ace UNK has some probability p perhaps UNK of making a UNK STOP 
START note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment to be binomial STOP 
START experiment where p is not constant STOP 
START UNK a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and UNK the UNK UNK his chance of a UNK STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START -hlthe trials are independent STOP 
START UNK speaking this means that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by UNK together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the single binomial trials STOP 
START thus in the UNK example af af and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace UNK ace in that order is af STOP 
START UNK we expect independence when the trials have nothing to do with one another STOP 
START examples where independence fails STOP 
START -hla family of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains and a UNK is tossed to decide STOP 
START we want to know the number of people going to the mountains STOP 
START when this experiment is viewed as composed of five binomial trials one for each member of the family the outcomes of the trials are obviously not independent STOP 
START indeed the experiment is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire family STOP 
START the following is a less extreme example of dependence STOP 
START consider couples visiting an art museum STOP 
START each person votes for one of a pair of pictures to receive a popular prize STOP 
START voting for one picture may be called success for the other failure STOP 
START an experiment consists of the voting of one couple or two trials STOP 
START in UNK of the experiment from couple to couple the votes of the two persons in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar UNK than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population of visitors STOP 
START table UNK UNK the point STOP 
START the table shows that UNK of the boys and UNK of the girls vote for picture a STOP 
START therefore under independent voting af or UNK of the couples would cast two votes for picture a and af or UNK would cast two votes for picture b STOP 
START thus in independent voting af or UNK of the couples would agree STOP 
START but table UNK shows that af or UNK agree too many for independent voting STOP 
START each performance of an UNK binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 through n as the value of the random variable x where af STOP 
START we want to study the probability function of this random variable STOP 
START for example we are interested in the number of UNK not which shots were UNK STOP 
START a binomial experiment can produce random variables other than the number of successes STOP 
START for example the UNK gets 5 shots but we take his score to be the number of shots before his first UNK that is 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 if he gets no UNK STOP 
START thus we do not score the number of UNK and the random variable is not the number of successes STOP 
START the UNK of p and the independence are the conditions most likely to give trouble in practice STOP 
START obviously very slight changes in p do not change the probabilities much and a slight lack of independence may not make an UNK difference STOP 
START for instance see example 2 of section UNK on red cards in hands of 5 STOP 
START on the other hand even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical phenomenon being studied the binomial model may still be used as a UNK for comparative purposes is we may discuss the phenomenon in terms of its UNK from the binomial model STOP 
START to UNK a binomial experiment consists of af independent binomial trials all with the same probability af of UNK a success STOP 
START the outcome of the experiment is x successes STOP 
START the random variable x takes the values af with probabilities af or more briefly af STOP 
START we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x successes for given values of p and n STOP 
START when each number of successes x is UNK with its probability of occurrence af the set of pairs af is a probability function called a binomial distribution STOP 
START the choice of p and n determines the binomial distribution UNK and different choices always produce different UNK except when af the number of successes is always 0 STOP 
START the set of all binomial UNK is called the family of binomial UNK but in general discussions this expression is often UNK to the binomial distribution or even the binomial when the context is clear STOP 
START binomial UNK were treated by james UNK about UNK and for this reason binomial trials are sometimes called UNK trials STOP 
START random variables STOP 
START UNK binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces either 0 or 1 success STOP 
START therefore each binomial trial can be thought of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that trial and taking the values 0 and 1 with probabilities q and p respectively STOP 
START the several trials of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable x the total number of successes which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single trials STOP 
START example 2 STOP 
START -hlthe UNK gets two UNK one on his third shot and one on his fifth STOP 
START the numbers of successes on the five individual shots are then 0 0 1 0 1 STOP 
START the number of successes on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 or 1 and there are 5 such random variables here STOP 
START their sum is x the total number of successes which in this experiment has the value af STOP

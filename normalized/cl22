START in good time i shall get to the UNK UNK to red UNK and handley walker to murder and sudden death STOP 
START but you realize i am sure how much old UNK UNK to new ones and you must forgive me if i tell you first of the old ones STOP 
START it was in UNK that UNK UNK and his sister sat by a UNK fire in their house on UNK common a UNK place even then STOP 
START he was UNK his razor STOP 
START sister said he do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven she answered i don't know but i hope you'll never do such a thing STOP 
START without a UNK god UNK said and went out and cut his throat in the UNK near UNK day's UNK STOP 
START what has this to do with the present i assure you STOP 
START you must know what gets into people even such as red and handley before you can tell what comes out of them STOP 
START they had learned both of them about UNK UNK STOP 
START that's why i beg you not to forget him STOP 
START his ghost is not laid STOP 
START red and handley god help them knew the old UNK UNK i knew they knew it for i'd told them a lot of it STOP 
START and isn't it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows gentlemen i am getting to the point to my point STOP 
START you know the facts are set forth in your own newspapers STOP 
START you want from me the story but a story is about why and then perhaps about how STOP 
START the when you know morning STOP 
START so what i am trying to tell you is the why that is my point and that concerns the spirit of the matter STOP 
START there is an UNK and a UNK to old furniture look at that UNK UNK behind you which has a UNK UNK if i may say so STOP 
START places too have their UNK qualities STOP 
START even people STOP 
START and my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter STOP 
START when you hold the spirit of a thing then somehow you know the truth you know a UNK antique from the real thing STOP 
START and the truth is what you've come for is it not UNK is one of those places that UNK into the UNK as UNK get into old wood under the UNK STOP 
START in fact all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like others STOP 
START there's a different UNK on them STOP 
START there were no UNK UNK here because everyone had a UNK in the family STOP 
START just think of old UNK UNK who pulled the teeth of dark younger her real name was UNK and because he UNK the job and left two UNK UNK she put such a UNK on him that he thought his legs were made of glass STOP 
START after that he was never known to run or even walk fast STOP 
START today UNK is the only deserted village in all new england that i know of STOP 
START there it UNK a small UNK with towns like UNK near by now it's the most lost and UNK place in the world STOP 
START those who lived in that UNK of UNK UNK took on some of the UNK UNK character STOP 
START scientists say it is the last UNK of a great UNK but one rather feels that only a UNK giant could have piled up those UNK UNK of UNK which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life in them STOP 
START we'll walk up there later STOP 
START it's perhaps a mile from here where we sit STOP 
START and not one single dwelling left there though once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred houses STOP 
START i myself have identified about sixty sites from the old maps and UNK STOP 
START a fascinating pursuit i assure you STOP 
START even i can remember nothing but ruined UNK and tumbled UNK and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man STOP 
START it is now a sweep of UNK and UNK with oak walnut and UNK UNK across the common and everywhere the UNK and the long long shadows STOP 
START that's your setting and a sinister one STOP 
START please get that in your reports STOP 
START it accounts for so many things STOP 
START both red UNK and handley walker lived nearby almost as near as i do STOP 
START red lived at UNK and from his house he could be up on the common in a half UNK UNK walk lived further on at UNK UNK STOP 
START i'd often find one or other of them up around UNK UNK STOP 
START they were both painters they were are should one say well anyhow UNK common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only sunday UNK still stray up there from time to time STOP 
START UNK railroad lack of water killed UNK STOP 
START dead dead as a brass door UNK and i sometimes feel like the UNK for i'm about the last to be even interested STOP 
START i knew red and handley well STOP 
START as i said they were both painters STOP 
START they'd come separately to UNK some twenty years ago there's always been an UNK colony somewhere on cape ann and each married here STOP 
START they married UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START there are a lot of UNK in this neck of the woods and many still make painted furniture and take UNK STOP 
START pretty girls among them with blonde hair and UNK faces STOP 
START handley married UNK and red of the red beard married UNK STOP 
START and it was because of an old UNK UNK that i got to understand them all so well STOP 
START the quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw but i must tell you about it STOP 
START oh yes i'm quite sure it's important because of the UNK pasture STOP 
START what's that that's what gave me the feeling gave me UNK the spirit the UNK evil spirit of this whole affair STOP 
START you see besides being UNK of UNK i am also UNK STOP 
START no i don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things STOP 
START i know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the UNK she carries where the live wind UNK and not from the hull STOP 
START but you've got to know both STOP 
START what's below the UNK interests me also STOP 
START as i was saying i've known all about the old records including the old UNK UNK STOP 
START some ten years ago that page was torn out i don't know by whom STOP 
START about five years ago handley came to ask me if he could see the UNK register STOP 
START he was UNK and casual about it as though it were of no consequence STOP 
START he's always like that in spite of being a big man STOP 
START when you see him you'll notice his habit of UNK i might almost say UNK a large UNK with black hairs on it by his right temple STOP 
START a UNK man but very UNK some would say UNK STOP 
START like his UNK black hair STOP 
START too many outside manners to my taste STOP 
START he is the sort who with an UNK eye would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then UNK her STOP 
START a real gentleman i feel would do neither STOP 
START he's always worn a UNK hat and i've noticed in my small study at the society that he rather UNK of UNK STOP 
START the next week cousin red UNK in as casually but curt and UNK STOP 
START red was small and UNK like UNK STOP 
START he too asked to see the same page STOP 
START when i told him someone had torn it out he shouted STOP 
START by god it's that damn handley the UNK later in the same week they both came together to examine the register STOP 
START fortunately we were alone in the building so few people nowadays are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days for they began to abuse each other in the UNK language STOP 
START red UNK out his UNK beard handley UNK under his suddenly UNK black hair STOP 
START they actually UNK STOP 
START le UNK et le UNK STOP 
START violent men both STOP 
START red always was UNK yet that day the UNK handley was the louder of the two STOP 
START but for my presence they would have been at each UNK UNK STOP 
START during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from the UNK each UNK at the other STOP 
START the UNK pasture had suddenly become valuable STOP 
START there's a fine UNK UNK there and UNK coming back for public buildings STOP 
START both men knew it was in the UNK family UNK but to which of the UNK did it belong UNK or UNK i knew almost exactly what the will had said STOP 
START it began with a UNK of course STOP 
START this explained that the judge of UNK of essex county UNK or UNK appointed three UNK of UNK to divide and establish the UNK estate STOP 
START after the usual honorable UNK it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the UNK UNK UNK one lower room on the western side UNK to the well and UNK and to one third of the cellar i can show you the cellar when we go up also one cow right and UNK they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as UNK namely the UNK pasture STOP 
START and i remember that the whole of the UNK not counting the UNK pasture was valued at twenty pounds STOP 
START i wish you could have seen the UNK fall on these two UNK UNK when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives UNK STOP 
START that battle scene ridiculous as it was remained in my mind STOP 
START a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further UNK with UNK if UNK colors for on a subsequent day i saw handley UNK UNK UNK wife up on UNK common STOP 
START i felt it would be UNK to UNK my presence STOP 
START not that i UNK go UNK but the UNK up there are very high and i am a small woman STOP 
START one other cause of UNK between them i must tell you STOP 
START paint and UNK as red UNK was he was much the better painter STOP 
START i suppose handley knew it STOP 
START if red had a show at UNK handley would hurry to hang his pictures in UNK STOP 
START you may say this has little UNK but gentlemen remember that all this prepared my mind UNK my intelligence STOP 
START by such touches the pattern takes shape STOP 
START you would call these the motives of crime STOP 
START i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the designs of destiny STOP 
START yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance to UNK our case as you would call it till yesterday STOP 
START one month ago on the 20th of october was the opening of the UNK season in massachusetts STOP 
START not much to shoot but there are a few UNK STOP 
START UNK too if you care for them which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate STOP 
START any more than they have the sense to eat UNK STOP 
START that was the day red was said to have gone away STOP 
START oh yes he'd talked about doing so STOP 
START in fact he often disappeared from time to time off to paint the sea aboard a UNK out from UNK STOP 
START UNK his wife never seemed to mind STOP 
START i suppose these UNK gave her more UNK for her UNK with cousin handley STOP 
START anyhow i wasn't surprised early that morning to see handley himself crossing from UNK common road to the back road STOP 
START no he didn't have his gun which he should have STOP 
START it would have been a good excuse for his being there at all STOP 
START i myself had been up there by seven o'clock after UNK since UNK been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as UNK glass STOP

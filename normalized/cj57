START some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned UNK of a learned world a UNK with which more UNK himself a holiday work a spontaneous UNK of intellectual high spirits a UNK of debate UNK comedy and invention STOP 
START with respect to this view two points are worth making STOP 
START first it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page utopia is described as UNK gay STOP 
START it UNK the other fact that it is described as UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK no less UNK than gay STOP 
START it also UNK the fact that in a rational UNK and quite clearly in UNK UNK the opposite of serious is not gay but UNK and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn STOP 
START more believed that a man could be both serious and gay STOP 
START that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion UNK UNK by all too many UNK who UNK believe that their UNK efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that UNK UNK which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of STOP 
START UNK to find a learned UNK and a UNK joke in UNK account of the stupid UNK of early sixteenth century wars of the UNK of the poor and UNK of the UNK and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a UNK toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral UNK and most surprising in more himself STOP 
START indeed it is even surprising in the UNK of christ church and UNK professor of UNK history who UNK this most peculiar view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most UNK UNK STOP 
START but to return to the main line of our inquiry it is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was medieval or even because he was a UNK indeed it is likely that these days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a UNK STOP 
START utopia is still widely read because in a sense more stood on the UNK of UNK STOP 
START and if he did stand on the UNK of UNK it was not in dying a UNK for such unity as UNK UNK might be able to force on western UNK STOP 
START it was not even in writing latin UNK sometimes UNK ones or in UNK UNK from greek into latin or in defending the study of greek against the attack of conservative UNK or in UNK the conservative UNK who opposed UNK UNK study of the new testament STOP 
START similar literary exercises were the common UNK of a christian UNK of the first two decades of the sixteenth century STOP 
START had UNK writings been wholly limited to such exercises they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time whose works UNK survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works STOP 
START more stands on the UNK of UNK for one reason alone because he wrote utopia STOP 
START and the evidence that he does indeed stand there UNK quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so STOP 
START only one other contemporary of UNK UNK so immediate and direct a response and only one other contemporary work UNK UNK and the prince STOP 
START can we discover what it is in utopia that has UNK this response that in seeking the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there do not even need to commit ourselves to UNK on the same UNK scale the relative importance of the medieval the renaissance and the modern STOP 
START the medieval was the most important to chambers because he sought to place thomas more the author of utopia in some intelligible relation with st. thomas more the UNK STOP 
START to others whose concern it is to UNK the significance of christian UNK the renaissance elements are of primary concern STOP 
START but here we have a distinctly modern UNK want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has want to know what is UNK new about utopia STOP 
START what is new about it that question the answer is simple can be made in two words utopian communism STOP 
START but it is an answer which opens the door wide to an UNK of objections and UNK STOP 
START surely there is nothing new about communism STOP 
START we find it in plato's republic and in utopia more UNK his debt to that book STOP 
START we find it in that common way of life UNK to christ and still in use among the UNK societies of christians that is the better UNK which made it easier to convert the UNK to christianity STOP 
START we find it in the later UNK conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions STOP 
START this conception was taken up by the early church fathers and by UNK lawyers and UNK in the middle ages more was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it STOP 
START but although the idea of communism is very old even in UNK day and did not spring UNK from his imagination in UNK it is not communism as such that we are concerned with STOP 
START we are concerned not with the UNK communism nor with other species of the UNK UNK UNK early christian UNK UNK or theological communism are concerned with utopian communism that is simply communism as it appears in the imaginary UNK of utopia as more conceived it STOP 
START perhaps one way to UNK our sense of the UNK of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of UNK theory STOP 
START we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not STOP 
START in plato's republic communism is to speak UNK a communism of UNK STOP 
START its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among whom private ownership UNK the governing UNK elite STOP 
START moreover it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what gave the initial UNK to plato's UNK into the construction of an imaginary UNK with its UNK communism of goods wives and children was his quest for a UNK for the proper ordering of the individual human UNK it is to this problem that the republic ultimately returns STOP 
START in UNK utopia communism is not a means of UNK out a UNK elite from the UNK mass STOP 
START utopian communism applies to all UNK STOP 
START and in the economy of the book it is not UNK but central STOP 
START the concern of utopia is with the UNK UNK UNK the best ordering of a civil society it is again and again made clear that utopian communism provides the UNK array UNK to that best ordering STOP 
START to derive utopian communism from the UNK christian community of the UNK age or from its medieval UNK the UNK communities is with an appropriate shift of UNK UNK in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual UNK in the UNK and UNK communities with an elite of spiritual and religious UNK STOP 
START the UNK community was literally an elite chosen by christ himself STOP 
START and the UNK communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a UNK which would test their religious UNK for UNK UNK their spiritual UNK STOP 
START finally the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the UNK was firmly fixed in a tradition by UNK time although it was not accepted by all the UNK of the middle ages STOP 
START in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man STOP 
START it did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had UNK STOP 
START the actual function of UNK communism was adequately set forth by st. UNK almost a UNK before more wrote utopia STOP 
START the soil is common to all men STOP 
START when we give the necessities of life to the poor we UNK to them what is already theirs STOP 
START we should think of it more as an act of justice than UNK STOP 
START because community not UNK of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely UNK right to what is his STOP 
START indeed of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience UNK to regard himself as a UNK STOP 
START he is a UNK for the common good however UNK the UNK which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his UNK of that share of the common fund UNK or UNK UNK to his keeping STOP 
START in contrast to this UNK view utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the UNK of municipal law is to UNK on the UNK sea of human UNK in a UNK STOP 
START the UNK brace conscience with legal UNK STOP 
START in a properly ordered society the massive force of public law UNK the function which in natural law theory UNK is left altogether to a small voice so often still STOP 
START in all the respects just indicated utopian communism UNK from previous UNK in which community of possessions and living plays a role STOP 
START neither from one of these UNK nor from a combination of them can it be UNK STOP 
START we do not deny UNK to the UNK because UNK found the tales of the house of UNK among the folk UNK of the UNK STOP 
START in a like sense whatever bits or UNK of previous UNK one may find in it utopian communism remains as an integral whole original a new thing STOP 
START it is not merely a new thing is one of the very few new things in utopia of the rest is medieval or UNK or part of an old tradition of social criticism STOP 
START but to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of utopia when martin UNK UNK a new perception of the nature of the UNK encounter with man STOP 
START new indeed is UNK perception but not modern as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what UNK was getting at STOP 
START although utopian communism is both new in UNK and also modern it is not modern communism or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice STOP 
START consider the features of utopian communism generous public provision for the UNK and secret elections of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common UNK common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens houses changed once a decade hours of UNK labor a day for all but a handful of UNK and scholars and careful measures to prevent anyone from UNK private property no money sort of UNK at all for any goods or services and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term STOP 
START whatever the merits of its intent utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist STOP 
START it is not the details of utopian communism that make utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude of mind that UNK those details STOP 
START what that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the UNK continuous history the one which reached christianity by the way of UNK through the church fathers of late UNK STOP

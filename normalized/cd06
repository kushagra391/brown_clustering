START i have within the past fifty years come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a UNK conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt STOP 
START it has been my lot all through life to associate with UNK scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions the nature of the hope of a life beyond this STOP 
START i have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world STOP 
START in an UNK yet in a very real sense i have followed the developments of archaeology UNK astronomy UNK and UNK with a UNK appreciation of the advances being made in these fields STOP 
START at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent UNK being made upon both old and new UNK by a higher criticism of the bible to UNK which i felt the need of a better knowledge of UNK and of archaeology for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the UNK of our faith was to UNK the entire structure STOP 
START doubts thus UNK left me UNK for a while and like some higher critical friends trying to continue to use the bible as the word of god while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of UNK and UNK attempting to bridge the UNK between an older UNK UNK generation and a critical UNK UNK race STOP 
START although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i stood outside shivering in the cold STOP 
START in one thing the higher critics like the UNK however UNK themselves in claiming that the gospel of john was not written in john's time but well after the first century perhaps as late as UNK UNK STOP 
START now if any part of the bible is UNK the very word of god speaking through his servant it is john's gospel STOP 
START to ask me to believe that so UNK marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some UNK UNK and was not inspired directly by the spirit of god is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the bible STOP 
START here i took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path to which we might give the modern name of UNK or the thing that works STOP 
START test it try it and if it works accept it as a UNK principle STOP 
START so i put my bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself and then tested it to see how it worked STOP 
START as a short possibly not the best method i looked up word in the UNK and noted that the bible claims from UNK 1 to revelation 22 to be god's personal message to man STOP 
START the next traditional step then was to accept it as the UNK UNK of the christian faith just as one would accept a UNK on any UNK science and i submitted to its conditions according to christ's invitation and promise that if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself john 7 17 STOP 
START the outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the bible as the word of god inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of our lord jesus christ as the only UNK son of god son of man by the virgin mary the UNK of the world STOP 
START i believe therefore that we are without exception UNK by nature UNK from god and that jesus christ the son of god came to earth the representative head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receives christ as his personal UNK is born again UNK with new UNK UNK and UNK UNK to live and grow in his UNK forever STOP 
START nor can any man save himself by good works or by a UNK moral life although such works are the natural fruits and UNK of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such UNK STOP 
START i now ever look for christ according to his promises and those of the old testament as well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to UNK in UNK over the whole earth STOP 
START to state fully what the bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to UNK the reasons for loving my nearest and UNK relatives and friends STOP 
START the bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body STOP 
START again as faith reveals god my father and christ my UNK i follow without question where he leads me daily by his spirit of love wisdom power and prayer STOP 
START i place his UNK and his UNK above every seeming probability UNK cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as UNK when opposed to him STOP 
START i UNK no limits to a faith UNK in god and christ who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and daring to trust him even though called to stand alone before the world STOP 
START our lord's invitation with its implied promise to all is come and see STOP 
START i stood at the UNK of my patient one day and UNK a very sick man in terrible pain STOP 
START as i UNK to his needs i noticed that his face was UNK in spite of his suffering and i learned that he was UNK not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the lord STOP 
START in his heart he had that peace of which the lord spoke when he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world UNK give i unto you STOP 
START let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid STOP 
START what a joy to realize that we too can claim this promise UNK by the lord during his UNK ministry to a group of men who were very dear to him STOP 
START he was about to leave them to UNK from this world and return to his father in heaven STOP 
START before he left them he promised that his peace would be their portion to UNK in their hearts and minds STOP 
START i praise god for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the lord jesus christ STOP 
START it makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the lord's guidance while UNK to the physical needs of my patients STOP 
START how often have i looked to jesus when entering the sick room asking for his presence and help in my professional duties as i give my talents not only as the world UNK but as one who loves the UNK and his creatures STOP 
START looking unto god the UNK UNK wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago thou UNK keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he UNK in thee STOP 
START are you UNK for peace in your heart a calm and UNK peace can be yours STOP 
START as only a member of the family can share in the UNK UNK of the family likewise one must belong to the family of god in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are his own STOP 
START perhaps you are not his child STOP 
START perhaps you do not know if you belong to him STOP 
START you may know that you are in god's family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your UNK father STOP 
START god so loved the world that he gave his only UNK son that UNK UNK in him should not UNK but have UNK life and as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name STOP 
START it is to those who believe on his name and belong to him that he gives his peace that empty peace the world offers but a deep UNK peace which nothing can destroy STOP 
START why not open your heart to the lord jesus christ now accept him as your UNK and let him fill you with peace that only he can give STOP 
START then with the UNK writer of old you can say i am resting today in his wonderful peace resting UNK in UNK control STOP 
START i am kept from all danger by night and by day and his glory is UNK my soul STOP 
START UNK UNK rockets UNK next UNK are stiff from UNK at the UNK of outer space which have captured the imagination of the american public STOP 
START cape UNK achievements thunder forth from the radio television and newspaper STOP 
START while we are filling outer space with scientific successes for many the inner space of their soul is an UNK UNK STOP 
START proof average of 50 UNK are reported in america each day out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce UNK is paid yearly to the UNK full-time UNK in the united states by fearful mankind who want to know what the future holds juvenile and adult is at an UNK high proof your daily newspaper in our rush to beat the russians we have forgotten these UNK words of jesus christ what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world that includes outer space and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul mark UNK UNK STOP 
START gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business according to god's standards STOP 
START it is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific UNK a fool would think otherwise STOP 
START but we must not forget man's soul STOP 
START is putting a UNK in orbit half so significant as the good news that god put his son jesus christ on earth to live and die to save our UNK souls for god so loved the world that he gave his only UNK son that UNK UNK in him should not UNK but have UNK life john 3 STOP 
START never forget that a chain is only as strong as its UNK link STOP 
START your spiritual inner space helps determine the UNK of america as a nation STOP 
START we trust you are not one of the UNK americans who do not attend church but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than UNK the god who made our country great STOP 
START is forgiveness of past sins assurance of present help and hope of future UNK in your orbit are you trying the UNK UNK to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within fame and fortune UNK your troubles with a drink and living it up with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry they may ease your hunger temporarily but they'll never take the place of a satisfying UNK UNK STOP 
START so it is UNK STOP 
START no amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the UNK of your inner space STOP 
START why your soul was made to be filled with god himself not religious functions about him STOP 
START only he can satisfy the deepest UNK STOP 
START that is why the bible commands you to taste and see that the lord is good blessed happy is the man that UNK in him UNK 34 8 STOP 
START you can receive god into your heart and life by a step of personal faith STOP 
START accept the UNK son of god jesus christ as your own personal UNK STOP 
START as many as received him jesus to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name STOP

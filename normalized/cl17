START the safe at UNK district station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow UNK that leads to captain UNK office to the left the UNK office farther along and to the left and the UNK supply closet straight ahead STOP 
START the safe is a UNK for three dead UNK UNK a hundred and fifty UNK UNK UNK cards a UNK of UNK UNK ball tickets from last year and UNK cents in UNK and UNK STOP 
START gun set the UNK fifth of UNK walker inside the safe before he reported to UNK killpath though he knew that UNK UNK prevented him from making any UNK UNK on UNK UNK gift STOP 
START it was more a matter of UNK and also it was none of UNK UNK business STOP 
START he walked up to the UNK office leaned UNK against the gun UNK that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a UNK gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range STOP 
START he stared at the clerk who sat at a UNK and ancient UNK desk UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK the UNK clerk UNK his head toward the UNK office STOP 
START gun went to the UNK door which was open and stood at attention while UNK UNK killpath in full uniform finished UNK his hair STOP 
START the UNK UNK brown hair was heavily UNK and as killpath UNK the UNK through it it stuck together in UNK so that it looked like UNK ribs UNK to his pink UNK STOP 
START the lieutenant UNK UNK reflection in the mirror over the UNK and then glanced back at his own face moving the UNK UNK around his head STOP 
START leave me alone gun thought STOP 
START fight with sam UNK fight with the whole damned bureau STOP 
START but leave me alone STOP 
START because i'm looking for the son of a UNK that killed that old man and i'm going to get him STOP 
START if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant STOP 
START killpath peered through UNK UNK at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and UNK STOP 
START gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window STOP 
START he sat UNK in a chair that did not UNK though it was obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly UNK a UNK chair STOP 
START the desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden file UNK with some of their UNK UNK off and a UNK stained with the roof UNK of countless seasons STOP 
START killpath pulled one thin leg up UNK his arms around the UNK to press his knee into an UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START it was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of killpath UNK his UNK STOP 
START he put his chin on his UNK stretching his neck like that of a UNK on a UNK block and stared UNK at his sergeant STOP 
START gun waited STOP 
START the UNK bell rang and he could hear the outside doors UNK shut closing in the assembled day watch STOP 
START finally UNK UNK through his hawk nose we can't have people running in any time they please sergeant STOP 
START no sir STOP 
START running in running out STOP 
START can't have it STOP 
START makes for confusion and UNK STOP 
START he UNK back in the chair knee locked against stomach his UNK eyes fixed on UNK STOP 
START he was silent again possibly listening to the sounds in the UNK STOP 
START roll was being called STOP 
START gun cleared his throat STOP 
START killpath said you were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago sergeant STOP 
START that's not getting all the juice out of the orange now is it no sir STOP 
START then killpath smiled STOP 
START gun knew that nothing but UNK back to back would give the lieutenant an UNK and a smile at the same time STOP 
START the UNK UNK commander UNK UNK was calling out the beat assignments but UNK couldn't make the names mean anything STOP 
START i called the station at three this morning UNK UNK voice pronounced STOP 
START do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time sergeant UNK sir STOP 
START now now you're just UNK sergeant STOP 
START he smiled UNK UNK his joke STOP 
START what if i said nobody was here but a couple of UNK sir UNK knows better than to leave the station without a relief STOP 
START he must have he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station UNK STOP 
START now that's not regulation is it no sir STOP 
START but you didn't know a thing about it did you leaned forward foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again frowning now STOP 
START that's not taking one's command with a responsible attitude UNK STOP 
START gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool STOP 
START but UNK was no UNK when it had rank STOP 
START i was out in the district sir STOP 
START oh yes STOP 
START so i have heard STOP 
START he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk STOP 
START i might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not ah limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped STOP 
START he took up a white sheet of paper dark with UNK data STOP 
START a car pulled into the driveway outside the window STOP 
START gun knew it was car 12 the wagon returned from UNK UNK UNK to the city jail STOP 
START but for some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail STOP 
START he stared at the report in UNK hand sure it was written by UNK just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his UNK UNK STOP 
START he UNK in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet again wound the UNK stems of his glasses around his ears and then UNK the report as it lay before him on the desk UNK acting lieutenant UNK UNK one failed to see that the station UNK was properly relieved two UNK himself throughout the entire watch without UNK on the UNK activities or the UNK of his section UNK three permitted members of the UNK detail of the UNK bureau to UNK for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to UNK the station commander acting captain o. t. killpath of a UNK occurring in the district five UNK UNK UNK known as UNK spots for purposes of an UNK and UNK social nature and six he leaned back and UNK off his glasses failed to UNK with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordered STOP 
START what have you to say to that sergeant UNK the paper across the desk but UNK didn't pick it up or even glance at it STOP 
START well i didn't think UNK knew so many big words lieutenant STOP 
START killpath UNK his lips STOP 
START patrolman UNK is an alert and UNK UNK officer STOP 
START i don't think his UNK UNK your UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK hell held his breath a moment pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the UNK in his throat STOP 
START sir STOP 
START i would have been UNK and a UNK lousy cop to boot if i'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district STOP 
START it's too bad i didn't call you and it's too bad i let UNK use UNK when he could have had a boy UNK be glad to learn something of UNK procedure STOP 
START but i'm not one damned bit sorry i went out to question the people i know in the places they hang around and let's not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant killpath UNK STOP 
START i shouldn't like to have to write you up for UNK as well as UNK of duty STOP 
START gun UNK his hands UNK into fists at his sides STOP 
START he UNK his UNK to keep the fury from UNK out STOP 
START an argument with UNK UNK killpath was as UNK and as UNK as a cap pistol on a firing range STOP 
START killpath leaned forward again UNK comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee STOP 
START let's just remember sergeant that we must all carry our own UNK STOP 
START a district station can't run smoothly unless he interrupted himself looking around gun at the doorway STOP 
START morning lieutenant UNK STOP 
START sorry UNK STOP 
START i thought you hadn't come in yet STOP 
START i've been here for some time STOP 
START he stood up UNK his head and UNK gun UNK STOP 
START the sergeant is just leaving STOP 
START it had come as no great surprise to UNK that the hot water in the UNK didn't work that UNK severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that some UNK bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes STOP 
START it was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in UNK office STOP 
START now as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded and said good night to the station UNK and his UNK not stopping to hear the UNK UNK of his chewing out STOP 
START not that he gave a damn what the UNK sent out about UNK little speech on the UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START he just didn't want to talk about it STOP 
START if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his UNK around the station all night killpath would just have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour he'd be damned if he was going to be a UNK UNK just to please his UNK UNK captain STOP 
START at the doorway he UNK up at the gray morning UNK and UNK his jacket pockets for the cigarettes remembering then that he'd left them at the UNK STOP 
START he could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going home STOP 
START but even before he started across the UNK road to his plymouth parked in the lot under the UNK trees across from the station he knew that he wasn't going home STOP 
START not yet STOP 
START it was nine o'clock in the morning the hour which like a UNK turning UNK of earth exposed to the day a UNK of busy creatures that had UNK UNK in the quiet night STOP 
START mission street at this hour was populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his tour of duty the neighborhood that had known UNK UNK by day STOP 
START then UNK phillips had purchased the alliance furniture UNK seventeen years ago STOP 
START it was UNK worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in UNK letters across each of the two display windows STOP 
START on the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was UNK UNK and under that UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START mr. phillips took a razor to UNK UNK but left the promise that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish UNK would be welcome STOP 
START language was no problem anyway phillips had only to signal from his doorway to UNK aid from the UNK UNK children who played on the UNK of mission street STOP 
START aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one UNK was not the most UNK mr. phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to gun UNK who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK special she's honest as the day mr. phillips said and added mr. UNK i can say this to you UNK is a little too honest STOP 
START you can't tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to UNK his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down time plan is a mere convenience you understand and when he interrupted himself smiling STOP 
START i put her in UNK STOP 
START that way i don't lose so much STOP 
START why don't you just hire somebody else STOP

START early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions STOP 
START and UNK UNK put its first marks on the combat record STOP 
START every plane that could fly was sent into the air STOP 
START UNK took eight ships and went south across the UNK and along the north coast of UNK to UNK STOP 
START anything the enemy flew or UNK was his target STOP 
START UNK with eight was to patrol the UNK gulf area with his main task to get any UNK before they got to the ships STOP 
START greg himself took two flights with UNK leading the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around UNK on the east coast of UNK STOP 
START each plane carried two UNK pound bombs STOP 
START a weapons UNK took greg UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK and the others the two miles from the UNK area to the strip STOP 
START it was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes STOP 
START no one had much to say STOP 
START the sky UNK down at them STOP 
START there was a feeling that this mission would be UNK like all the others and that this UNK wet dark world of combat would go on forever STOP 
START the truck dropped them off at the various UNK spread through the jungle STOP 
START UNK snatched UNK UNK from him with a UNK motion and almost ran to the plane with it STOP 
START his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot STOP 
START greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before STOP 
START but his hands and those of UNK moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the UNK procedure STOP 
START i've got her as neat as i can UNK said as he dropped the UNK of the UNK UNK over UNK shoulders STOP 
START but this UNK climate STOP 
START it's for UNK not UNK STOP 
START we'll make out STOP 
START don't you worry chief greg replied wondering if he himself believed it STOP 
START yeah STOP 
START see you UNK said as he jumped off the wing STOP 
START the expression was his UNK his open UNK to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return STOP 
START at the UNK time greg started the engine and UNK out STOP 
START from the time the UNK were pulled until the plane was out of sight he knew UNK would keep his back to the strip STOP 
START he wondered where the UNK had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission STOP 
START yet long before the scheduled time for return UNK would be watching for every UNK in the sky STOP 
START greg UNK down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him STOP 
START the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful STOP 
START the UNK heads looked UNK small STOP 
START the control tower gave him immediate UNK permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of UNK STOP 
START UNK mission was the last to leave and as he UNK the ships off UNK he saw the clouds were dropping down again STOP 
START to the west the dark green hills of UNK were lost in the clouds about halfway up their UNK STOP 
START underneath him the sea was a dark and UNK gray STOP 
START water UNK against his UNK as he led the flight in and out of UNK STOP 
START the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it STOP 
START he possessed the UNK UNK horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this UNK territory STOP 
START he UNK in the warm cockpit STOP 
START the UNK was solid above him STOP 
START as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it STOP 
START they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated UNK from UNK and hope that it didn't close in before they returned STOP 
START greg pushed the radio UNK on his UNK STOP 
START UNK let's try to go under this stuff STOP 
START stay in close and we'll go up the valley STOP 
START roger UNK UNK called back and pulled his four in and slightly above greg STOP 
START greg took the formation wide around three UNK attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf STOP 
START he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of the city of UNK and UNK into the opening that showed against the mountain STOP 
START the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed UNK turn STOP 
START it was only a UNK flight but before it was through greg felt himself developing a case of UNK STOP 
START the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times the sheer UNK seemed about to close in STOP 
START if the other UNK were worried they did not show it STOP 
START the formation remained perfect STOP 
START when the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if the sun had come out STOP 
START he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast STOP 
START although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity STOP 
START once UNK thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him STOP 
START somebody beat us to it said over the radio as he came back up in formation STOP 
START UNK continued to be limited and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet STOP 
START it was UNK STOP 
START his UNK were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights STOP 
START he thought once that he identified the somewhat UNK voice of UNK claiming a kill STOP 
START but UNK area remained as UNK as a florida dawn STOP 
START finally as time began to run out he headed into UNK and UNK a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies STOP 
START the low clouds made UNK difficult STOP 
START there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run STOP 
START the accuracy was UNK STOP 
START one of UNK bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it STOP 
START only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle STOP 
START with their load of bombs gone the planes moved swiftly and easily STOP 
START greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home STOP 
START UNK it was still open STOP 
START like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley STOP 
START he was about to make a gas check on his flight when UNK voice broke in UNK UNK STOP 
START twelve o'clock level STOP 
START UNK eyes UNK up from his instrument panel STOP 
START he saw them UNK against the gray but closing fast STOP 
START they were headed straight for each other on a UNK course STOP 
START friend or enemy same old question STOP 
START and only a few seconds to answer it STOP 
START UNK said UNK and UNK STOP 
START and then he thought UNK might be right STOP 
START his mind UNK through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification STOP 
START he UNK the shape down to two either a zero or a u. s. navy type aircraft STOP 
START if it were the enemy UNK his position was correct STOP 
START japanese aircraft were strong on UNK american on speed and UNK STOP 
START his present maximum UNK up against the UNK gave him the opportunity to UNK his advantages STOP 
START but it also made him UNK to the enemy if it was the enemy and he hadn't been spotted already STOP 
START but the closing aircraft showed no sign of UNK from their original course STOP 
START in seconds greg made his decision STOP 
START he pushed the radio UNK STOP 
START UNK blue hit the deck STOP 
START lots of UNK STOP 
START UNK you take the one on the left STOP 
START i'll take the middle STOP 
START UNK the one on the right STOP 
START if they're UNK STOP 
START let's make sure first STOP 
START greg had the stick forward and the UNK up before he heard the two UNK STOP 
START the planes light with most of the gas burned out responded beautifully STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK was over UNK when he leveled off just above the trees STOP 
START the opposing aircraft continued to come on STOP 
START they appeared to be the enemy STOP 
START greg wished the air corps had continued to UNK planes STOP 
START there was of course no way for the other planes to get by them STOP 
START it was a box STOP 
START but they could turn and escape to the east STOP 
START greg pushed the radio UNK again STOP 
START UNK drop your second element back STOP 
START if any of us miss they can pick up the pieces STOP 
START now let's make sure they're UNK STOP 
START even as he said it greg knew they had found the enemy STOP 
START the shapes were UNK and the rising UNK were showing up slightly UNK UNK in the gray gloom STOP 
START greg UNK his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight STOP 
START the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the UNK glass in front of him STOP 
START his hands shook STOP 
START arm your guns UNK STOP 
START they're UNK STOP 
START they're UNK came a UNK voice STOP 
START greg to UNK blue STOP 
START one pass only STOP 
START no turns STOP 
START you'll UNK your UNK in this canyon STOP 
START that's an order STOP 
START he moved the flights over against one wall STOP 
START it gave them all a chance to make a UNK climbing turn attack and a UNK that would not take them into the UNK or force a UNK recovery STOP 
START if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out STOP 
START a hell of an UNK for a barrel roll but it could be done STOP 
START greg slammed his UNK to the fire wall and UNK up the UNK and the engine responded as if it had been waiting STOP 
START the clearly UNK enemy continued on as if no one else were around STOP 
START they haven't seen us greg yelled to himself over the engine noise STOP 
START they haven't seen us STOP 
START he hit the radio UNK STOP 
START now UNK now STOP 
START let's take 'em home STOP 
START he UNK back on the stick and felt his cheeks UNK STOP 
START out of the corner of his eye he watched his UNK move out a bit and shoot up with him STOP 
START perfect he thought STOP 
START with the rapid rate of UNK the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be done STOP 
START just like shooting at a UNK while performing a UNK from a UNK board STOP 
START he UNK his turn STOP 
START his nose up STOP 
START it was going to be dangerous STOP 
START eight aircraft in this small box STOP 
START please dear god make my UNK good he prayed STOP 
START he took a lead on the enemy using a distance of five of the UNK in his circular sight and then added another STOP 
START the enemy did not UNK STOP 
START it did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted STOP 
START blind UNK STOP 
START now fingers closed on the stick trigger STOP 
START the plane UNK and slowed STOP 
START six red lines UNK their way into the gray and vanished STOP 
START as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them STOP 
START greg UNK his turn until the plane UNK STOP 
START luck was with him STOP 
START his burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane STOP 
START the UNK UNK flew off in pieces STOP 
START a large piece of engine UNK vanished STOP 
START it was all greg had time to see STOP 
START his UNK for the shot had placed him near the UNK almost UNK and heading up into the clouds STOP 
START his speed was dropping rapidly STOP 
START if he spun out now he would join his opponent on the ground STOP 
START UNK stay clear he prayed STOP 
START he pushed stick and UNK and entered the UNK on his back STOP 
START he fought the panic of UNK STOP 
START he had no idea which was up and which was down STOP 
START he held the controls where they had been STOP 
START sweat UNK out over him and he felt the UNK between his palm and the stick grip STOP 
START his air speed dropped until he thought he would UNK out STOP

START well said mr. skyros STOP 
START i take a little time to think it over STOP 
START it was awkward very awkward STOP 
START there would be all the UNK of UNK someone else to take over STOP 
START someone reasonably UNK STOP 
START and angie would hear about it STOP 
START and angie knew time said angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at mr. skyros STOP 
START not too much time because i'll be UNK some more myself pretty much right away STOP 
START and i done UNK for you big favor not so long back didn't i and i'm right here to take on where pretty left off STOP 
START no trouble STOP 
START i don't want no trouble you don't want no trouble nobody wants trouble mr. skyros STOP 
START dear heaven no thought mr. skyros turning away as another man came in STOP 
START he straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand UNK smile seemed painted on his face STOP 
START angie knew speak of dangerous information knew too much entirely already STOP 
START really he had mr. skyros at bay big favor i done you STOP 
START UNK there's this deal o' UNK and UNK UNK UNK fire ain't it maybe you've been UNK UNK over that STOP 
START and can't say i blame you said angie thoughtfully STOP 
START this deal with the ace o' UNK STOP 
START anything to do with an ace o' UNK bad luck STOP 
START ace of UNK a widow that was what they called a widow these UNK UNK remembered mr. skyros UNK STOP 
START all about that angie knew too STOP 
START when things got a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand it seemed to be a general rule STOP 
START all just by chance and in a way tracing back to poor frank all of it because naturally brothers living together and angie mr. skyros did not at all like the look on UNK UNK almost UNK UNK face or indeed anything about UNK STOP 
START mr. skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles found money much more interesting all the same he thought now UNK of the way in which UNK earned his living and paid for his own stuff and UNK the soft smile and the UNK dark eyes and he felt a little ill STOP 
START look my friend he said in my life i learn how is it the UNK says better an UNK of prevention to a pound of cure STOP 
START i stay in business so long because i'm careful STOP 
START two weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal isn't it that's a long while said angie STOP 
START i tell you you want to leave it that way i don't fool around with it STOP 
START i go over to castro and get fixed up there STOP 
START i can't wait no two weeks STOP 
START and mr. skyros didn't like angie but what with UNK and three of his boys inside and not likely to come out and angie such a valuable salesman UNK said all the UNK and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys why did everything have to happen at once said UNK why you ain't turning angie down are you mr. skyros mean we all figured i guess UNK figure angie UNK gave him an UNK smile STOP 
START mr. skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me he said STOP 
START it's UNK UNK UNK UNK ain't it mr. skyros god the name repeated over and over anybody to hear not being a fool mr. skyros knew why STOP 
START but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have UNK with one who was UNK an UNK and actually held you could say the whip hand STOP 
START and all because of UNK mr. skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause of course there was another factor STOP 
START angie worth his weight in gold right now but these UNK they sometimes went down fast STOP 
START who knew angie might not last long STOP 
START the sweat broke out on mr. UNK forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking hoping planning perhaps good god above had not UNK been enough UNK UNK thin shoulder UNK STOP 
START now you don't want to go talking that way he said STOP 
START sure sure you're the one take over for pretty soon as i get the supply get started up again isn't it don't need worry UNK STOP 
START i tell you i know how it is with you my friend i UNK and i'll make it a special point a special favor get in touch and get some stuff just for you STOP 
START i don't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow but i'll try my best my friend STOP 
START you see you got to remember we all got UNK like any business man he won't be around a little while he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the elite STOP 
START it's awkward you see that isn't it well that's your business mr. skyros said angie and his UNK eyes moved past mr. UNK shoulder to gaze vaguely out the UNK window STOP 
START i appreciate it you do that STOP 
START sure STOP 
START we don't none of us want no trouble STOP 
START i'm in a room over the golden club on san UNK you just ask for me there you want see me STOP 
START or maybe i call you tonight nine o'clock i call and see if you got any STOP 
START a couple UNK for me mr. skyros and UNK to sell see i like to have a little ready cash STOP 
START oh now i don't know about that much said mr. skyros STOP 
START and you know UNK pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they say sure said angie STOP 
START sure mr. skyros STOP 
START fifty a throw that the deal STOP 
START i bring you the cash say five hundred for ten UNK STOP 
START never mind how much i cut it how much i get and he smiled his UNK smile again STOP 
START standard deal mr. skyros STOP 
START you go UNK have a look round for it STOP 
START i do my best said mr. skyros earnestly just for you my friend STOP 
START this is awkward for everybody isn't it we all got to put up with UNK sometimes STOP 
START but i do my best for you STOP 
START he got out of there in a hurry UNK past another man in the door UNK his UNK STOP 
START the UNK thing yes very true one must make do as one could in some situations STOP 
START it could all be straightened out later STOP 
START not very much later but when things had settled down a little STOP 
START after this deal with the UNK woman went through STOP 
START an ace of UNK STOP 
START he was not a UNK man but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that indeed STOP 
START he rather wished he had never got into the business and still scarcely to be UNK a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money UNK UNK who would be UNK ross so very soon now rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change STOP 
START she did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks STOP 
START usually she marked the few who did thank you you didn't get that kind much in a place like this and she played a little game with herself seeing how UNK UNK she could act to the others before they'd take UNK threaten to call the manager STOP 
START funny how seldom they did used to it probably STOP 
START the kind who came into a cheap store like this UNK i saw that first here i'll take this i was before her you wait on me now or i don't bother with it see kind of place she'd be through here just no time at all leave this kind of thing UNK behind STOP 
START off at noon and she'd never come back STOP 
START never have to STOP 
START money a lot of money enough STOP 
START she'd be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills UNK nobody would suspect maybe couldn't get it until monday account of that the banks but that wasn't really long to wait STOP 
START not when she'd waited so long already STOP 
START no need say anything at all to the old woman STOP 
START she had it all planned out how she'd do STOP 
START she'd say she didn't feel good on sunday couldn't go to church UNK be a little argument but she could be stubborn and when the old woman had gone quick pack the things she'd need to take all but the dress she'd wear monday and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a UNK overnight for a UNK STOP 
START then on monday morning or it might have to be tuesday get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the UNK STOP 
START she wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after UNK had left go do the daily shopping STOP 
START no need leave a note with it either or maybe just something like don't worry about me i'm going away to make a better life STOP 
START a better life STOP 
START escape STOP 
START it wasn't as if she wanted much STOP 
START she didn't mind working hard not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft all she wanted was a chance where she wasn't marked as what she was STOP 
START to be UNK ross and work in a UNK shop somewhere at a little more money so she could have UNK clothes and learn UNK manners and all like that and get to know different people than up to now not just the ones like her here with UNK names the ones went to the same church and different place different job different people she'd be all different too STOP 
START UNK she'd do her hair another way and wear different kinds of clothes she'd be UNK ross just what that sounded like STOP 
START you've give me the wrong change said the customer sharply STOP 
START think i can't count made up the amount in indifferent silence STOP 
START she was listening to other voices out of the future STOP 
START some of those UNK new different people STOP 
START oh UNK UNK nice and pretty too i like UNK let's ask UNK to go with us she's always lots of fun UNK soon very soon now sixteen UNK didn't wake until nearly UNK STOP 
START it was going to be another hot day the UNK stood close to ninety STOP 
START UNK was still sound asleep made fresh coffee and UNK through all the desk UNK for more cigarettes before thinking of her UNK and found a UNK stray cigarette at its bottom which UNK UNK of face powder STOP 
START he left a note UNK on the desk asking her to call him sometime today and drove home STOP 
START after he'd got out fresh liver for UNK he paused to look at her crouched UNK over her dish STOP 
START surely she was just a UNK UNK around the middle seemed to remember reading somewhere that UNK had large UNK and suffered a UNK vision of the apartment UNK with a dozen UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK what then asked her severely STOP 
START a lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats it's not the UNK thing in the world to find good homes for UNK and damn it you know very well if i have them around long impossible to give them away i suppose now that you've finally grown up if a little late you'd go on producing UNK every six months or so STOP 
START yes well it's a pity to UNK your UNK figure which all those UNK would do anyway but i think when you've raised these we'll just have the UNK fix it so there won't be any more STOP 
START i wonder if the UNK would take one STOP 
START and it's no good looking at me like that as she wound UNK around his UNK STOP

START in one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of UNK thompson told UNK of his distress at having had to leave london before this new friendship had developed further that was a very absurd and UNK situation in which i was placed by w. UNK curious methods of handling me STOP 
START he never let me know that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning i was to leave for UNK STOP 
START the result was that i found myself in the ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for the next week only two days before my departure from london STOP 
START UNK both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion it was not i STOP 
START it need hardly be remarked that thompson was not generally known for his UNK about keeping his social UNK which makes his UNK in this letter all the more significant STOP 
START when thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which included UNK UNK from UNK mrs. king felt a proper UNK alarm STOP 
START some she knew looked upon thompson almost as a saint but others read in the UNK of heaven what they took to be the UNK of a great UNK who like UNK UNK had as one UNK writer later put it thrown himself on the swelling wave of every passion STOP 
START consequently on october 31 UNK mrs. king wrote to thompson quite against her UNK wishes asking him not to UNK a correspondence which i believe has been dropped for some weeks STOP 
START UNK was staying at a UNK and her mother felt that as thompson himself seems to have suggested she might eventually stay there STOP 
START this prospect did not please mrs. king any more than did the possibility that her daughter might marry a UNK but she used it to suggest to thompson that it is not in her nature to love you STOP 
START for his part thompson had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between katie and himself STOP 
START at no time does he seem to have proposed marriage and mrs. king was evidently torn between a concern for her UNK emotions and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation STOP 
START in any case she told thompson that she saw no reason why he might not see katie again now that this frank explanation has been made no one can UNK STOP 
START she ended her letter with the assurance that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself to be an honor from which she could not part without still more pain STOP 
START after thompson came to london to live he received a letter from katie which was dated february 8 UNK STOP 
START she regretted what she described as the UNK unnecessary check to their friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another perfectly STOP 
START this letter concluded with an invitation i am a great deal at the little children's hospital STOP 
START mr. UNK knows the way STOP 
START i know you are very busy now you are writing a great deal your book is coming out isn't it if you are able care to come you know how glad i shall be STOP 
START ever yours UNK UNK douglas king the invitation was accepted and other letters followed in which she spoke of her concern for his health and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the UNK children she served STOP 
START it is difficult to say what thompson expected would come of their relationship which had begun so soon after his emotions had been stirred by maggie UNK but when katie wrote on april 11 1900 to tell him that she was to be married to the rev. UNK UNK the UNK of UNK in UNK the news evidently helped to UNK his UNK over the failure of his hopes for a new volume of verse STOP 
START in a letter to UNK which was written in june less than a month before UNK wedding he was highly UNK in his despair and once again announced his intention of returning to the life of the streets a week in UNK and without means to pay i must go it is the only right thing STOP 
START perhaps mrs. UNK would do me the UNK UNK to keep my own copy of the first edition of my first book with all its UNK of her and the dear ones STOP 
START last not least there are some poems which k. king sent me addressed to herself when i was preparing a fresh volume asking me to include them STOP 
START the terrible blow of the new year put an end to that project STOP 
START i wish you would return them to her STOP 
START i have not the heart STOP 
START i never had the courage to look at them when my projected volume became hopeless UNK they were poor until now when i was obliged to do so STOP 
START o my genius young and UNK you would UNK when i wrote them now has it all come to chance of UNK my destiny is over STOP 
START i want you to be grandfather to these UNK poems dear UNK now i am gone UNK them on the world when their time comes STOP 
START for them a box will be UNK enough STOP 
START katie cannot mind your seeing them now my silence must have ended when i gave the UNK volume to you STOP 
START i ask you to do me the last UNK of reading them by 8 UNK evening about which time i shall come to say my sad UNK STOP 
START if you don't think much of them tell me the wholesome truth STOP 
START if otherwise you will give me a pleasure STOP 
START o UNK is strange this yes terrible step i am about to take is UNK with an UNK joy by the UNK hope that here in these poems is UNK or at least some measure of beauty which i did not know of STOP 
START thompson of course was persuaded not to take the terrible step once again paid his debts and it was katie rather than thompson whose life was soon ended for she died in UNK in april UNK in the first year of her marriage STOP 
START the UNK poems mentioned in the letter to UNK UNK a group of five UNK which were published in the 1913 edition of UNK works under the heading ad UNK plus certain other completed pieces and rough UNK gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books STOP 
START the publication of father UNK the man has wings has made more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contained can now be had without difficulty STOP 
START some of the poems express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love suggest its coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he UNK of a final separation STOP 
START the somewhat UNK love story which these poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more than a little of UNK sincerity STOP 
START when they were first written there was evidently no thought of their being published and those which refer to the UNK love for mrs. UNK particularly have the ring of truth STOP 
START in my UNK young virgin date for example thompson wrote UNK she that had my UNK young virgin date not now UNK that noble singular she i UNK hold though UNK from her once state than others in their best UNK STOP 
START my own stern hand has rent the ancient bond and thereof shall the ending not have end but not for me that loved her to be fond lightly to please me with a newer friend then hold it more than UNK song that i affirm to thee with heart of pride i knew not what did to a friend belong till i stood up true friend by thy true side absence UNK comfort is by far than UNK of other women are into account UNK capacity for UNK and the possibility of a wish to identify his own life with the UNK of other poets who had known unhappy loves there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for katie king STOP 
START that she was affected by his UNK seems obvious but since she was evidently a sensible young woman as well as an UNK and sympathetic type it would seem that for her the word friendship had a far less intense emotional significance than that which thompson gave it STOP 
START from the outset she must have realized that marriage with him was out of the question and although she was UNK by the UNK interference it seems probable that she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was perhaps a man most fitted to live die solitary in the love only of the highest lover STOP 
START the poems which were addressed to her while they are far more restrained than those of love in UNK lap show no great technical advance over those of the narrow vessel group and are if anything somewhat more UNK STOP 
START their interest remains chiefly UNK for they throw some light on the utter despair which UNK thompson in the spring and early summer of 1900 STOP 
START whether or not UNK is correct in suggesting that UNK UNK of the opium habit also dates from this period is of course a matter of UNK STOP 
START UNK simply states without offering any supporting evidence that after he returned to london he resumed his UNK of UNK and continued this right up to his death STOP 
START there is every reason to recognize that in the very last years of his life as we shall see thompson did take the drug in carefully UNK doses to ease the pains of his illness but the exact date at which this began has never been determined STOP 
START if as UNK says nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not taking opium there may be some reason to doubt that he was under its influence in the period from UNK to 1900 when he was writing the poems to katie king and making plans for another book of verse STOP 
START in any event the critical productivity of that time is UNK proof that if he was taking UNK it was never in command of him to the extent that it had been during his UNK years STOP 
START UNK remedy for UNK UNK mood was typically practical STOP 
START he simply found more work for him to do and the articles and UNK continued without an evident break STOP 
START 3 as a UNK thompson generally displayed a UNK attitude STOP 
START that he read some of the books assigned to him with a studied UNK is evident from his notes which are often so full that they provide an UNK basis for the identification of UNK that were printed without his UNK STOP 
START on the basis of this careful reading thompson frequently gave a clear complete and interesting description of a prose work or chose effective UNK to illustrate his discussions of poetry STOP 
START he was seldom an UNK critic and his UNK generally followed a systematic pattern a description of what the work contained a treatment of the things that had especially interested him in it and wherever possible a UNK of whatever artistic merits and UNK he might have found STOP 
START it was of course in this drawing of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire to do full justice to an author STOP 
START UNK UNK the testament of an empire builder for example thompson found that there was too much UNK UNK STOP 
START poetry he said must be UNK it must not UNK to argue like a UNK in UNK STOP 
START yet UNK impressed him as a poet capable of sustained power passion or beauty and he cited specific passages to illustrate not only these qualities but UNK command of UNK as well STOP 
START similarly he wrote that UNK UNK had a too deliberate manner as well as a lack of inevitable UNK in UNK STOP 
START but he admired UNK subtle UNK and delighted in the UNK by which divine love becomes the most fatal UNK in love the UNK STOP 
START of course there were books about which nothing good could be said STOP 
START understanding as he did the difficulty of the art of poetry and believing that the only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of poets he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please when it came to the review of a book of verse STOP

START much more than shelter housing UNK social status a sense of belonging acceptance within a given group or neighborhood identification with particular cultural values and social institutions feelings of pride and worth aspirations and hopes basic to human UNK STOP 
START for almost UNK of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence UNK a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as UNK by most americans STOP 
START few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate UNK and home builders STOP 
START this pressure has urged UNK of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country STOP 
START it is not surprising that as spokesman for real estate interests the national association of real estate boards UNK and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure STOP 
START how does the local UNK see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race religion or ethnic UNK does he conceive his role to be in this area of social UNK ought to be what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change social ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation a group of the faculty at UNK UNK public affairs center sought some answers to these questions STOP 
START several new england realtors were invited to participate in a small UNK of property lawyers political scientists UNK social psychologists social UNK and UNK STOP 
START here in an atmosphere of UNK and mutual criticism each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it STOP 
START for a number of years UNK has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy STOP 
START this article presents our observations of that session of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them STOP 
START such conversation quickly reveals an UNK significant UNK in the UNK held by most realtors STOP 
START within the membership of this group as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations the most ready UNK of UNK to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a UNK or UNK and UNK between them STOP 
START professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner STOP 
START but as conversation goes on particularly among the realtors themselves another image UNK that of considerable power and influence in the community STOP 
START obviously much more than customer expectation is determining the UNK role STOP 
START judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential UNK income educational level and above all racial UNK whether these would qualify them for UNK happy relations to other people in certain community areas STOP 
START a narrow UNK how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any UNK of UNK UNK cases or in a review of UNK code of ethics article 34 in the code adopted in UNK states that a UNK should never be instrumental in UNK into a neighborhood a character of property or UNK members of any race or UNK or any individuals whose presence will clearly be UNK to property values in that neighborhood STOP 
START though the reference to race was UNK by the association in 1950 being an agent of such UNK influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid STOP 
START the UNK for this UNK was most frequently expressed in economic terms feared the supposed UNK they believed would inevitably attach to any UNK who openly introduced UNK particularly negro peoples into UNK restricted areas STOP 
START they would become UNK as men not interested in being purely real estate UNK but UNK for some kind of cause or reform and this was no longer to be a pro STOP 
START obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional with narrow skills and UNK the effective UNK of a client rather than UNK to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work STOP 
START these men for the most part educated in our best new england colleges well established UNK and socially in the community under UNK but UNK UNK reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their UNK about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional UNK of a UNK relationship STOP 
START this narrow UNK does not even fit the present realities of their situation as the pressure of UNK and the power and UNK of the realtors increase STOP 
START as our discussion continued the UNK of the client relationship as an interpretation of their way of operating became evident STOP 
START realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work as members of social and professional organizations as citizens and civic leaders as church UNK as university UNK as newspaper readers etc. STOP 
START from such UNK roles the UNK finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding STOP 
START it seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas 1 the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue 2 their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes most UNK 3 their interpretation of who is a real pro of what it means to be a professional man in a technical UNK society STOP 
START 1 most of the realtors UNK their own understanding of and role in the racial issue pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society STOP 
START there is some reality to this commission on race and housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less UNK UNK on the whole than any other UNK of the american population STOP 
START but such a reaction UNK the powerful efforts made in the past by both UNK and its local boards for the maintenance of UNK UNK and practices STOP 
START also it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed STOP 
START like business and university groups generally these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might UNK the decisions they make STOP 
START realtors both generally and in this group have invariably UNK residential integration with a decline in property values a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension STOP 
START recent studies by the commission on race and housing and others however point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion STOP 
START there are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated UNK without great loss of property values the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the UNK desire for UNK housing privacy etc. STOP 
START data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be UNK in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in STOP 
START often they are able to get in only because the area is UNK economically STOP 
START significantly no UNK and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes published by the university of california press that present the UNK findings STOP 
START no one UNK any radical shift in this situation but questions concerning reading habits the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised STOP 
START the role of both church and university as sources of information and UNK within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration STOP 
START relevant facts however extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of UNK neighborhoods STOP 
START discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity the function and limitations of government in the UNK of such equality and the UNK that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial UNK and UNK STOP 
START against the grain of creation 2 realtors realize of course that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for UNK on their relation to UNK as well as opportunities for UNK of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing STOP 
START on the positive side recent federal action has largely UNK the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the UNK position UNK in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and while specific provisions have varied the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage STOP 
START realtors in attendance at the UNK expressed interest for example in UNK new housing law as setting standards of UNK that they would like to have to UNK but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record STOP 
START as far as they were aware the connecticut association of real estate boards had not officially opposed the UNK passage or UNK in its support STOP 
START this has not been the case everywhere STOP 
START in 1957 the real estate boards of new york city actively opposed the then pending private housing UNK law STOP 
START official reasoning the bill was a UNK invasion of basic property rights STOP 
START there are sins of UNK as well as commission attitude adopted by realtors and their associations either negative or positive plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced STOP 
START judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v. UNK 1948 has rendered racial UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry but there is little evidence that realtors or at least their associations have UNK the principle in such UNK STOP 
START in the states that have passed laws UNK discrimination in the sale or rental of housing support by real estate associations for UNK and UNK coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social UNK that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid STOP 
START but as yet no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the UNK of UNK minority UNK into UNK neighborhoods STOP 
START one of the roles of the social scientist UNK or UNK in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work STOP 
START but UNK to these opportunities UNK that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional white american good STOP 
START such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world let us say a community that UNK UNK or UNK but is also UNK UNK since it is UNK STOP 
START that community of all creation is then the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete UNK of all moral judgment STOP 
START racial discrimination is wrong then not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to UNK with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator STOP 
START thus moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions STOP 
START a UNK society 3 over the years individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed STOP 
START most realtors and real estate UNK talk of themselves as professional people with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional UNK STOP 
START but what significance UNK to professional beyond the narrow sense of UNK in meeting a UNK stated needs as already noted faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other STOP 
START as a UNK in the group pointed out a professional was before the modern period of technical UNK one who UNK to be a UNK and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills STOP

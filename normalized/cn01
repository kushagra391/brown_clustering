START dan morgan told himself he would forget ann UNK STOP 
START he was well rid of her STOP 
START he certainly didn't want a wife who was UNK as ann STOP 
START if he had married her he'd have been asking for trouble STOP 
START but all of this was UNK STOP 
START sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back to sleep STOP 
START his plans and dreams had UNK around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing STOP 
START the UNK thing would be to sell out to al UNK and leave the country but there was a stubborn UNK in him that wouldn't allow it STOP 
START the best UNK for the bitterness and disappointment that UNK him was hard work STOP 
START he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake STOP 
START each day he found himself thinking less often of ann day the hurt was a little UNK a little less UNK STOP 
START he had plenty of work to do STOP 
START because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years STOP 
START the grass in the UNK came fast now that the warm weather was here STOP 
START he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the UNK in his UNK STOP 
START he had no idea how much time UNK would give him STOP 
START in any case he had no intention of being caught asleep so he carried his revolver in its UNK on his UNK and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence STOP 
START he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his UNK as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with UNK calm STOP 
START when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and UNK to his rifle STOP 
START it could be some kind of trick UNK had thought up STOP 
START no one walked in this country least of all ed UNK or dutch UNK or any of the rest of the bar b crew STOP 
START morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled STOP 
START when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever STOP 
START he cleaned his UNK left it against the fence picked up his winchester and started UNK STOP 
START his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow UNK toward the house STOP 
START now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and UNK UNK as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet STOP 
START reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his winchester in his hands STOP 
START they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty STOP 
START they were dirty their clothes were torn and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door STOP 
START she lay there making no effort to get back on her feet STOP 
START the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really UNK STOP 
START morgan hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one STOP 
START he didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending STOP 
START the boy UNK his dry lips STOP 
START he asked could we have a drink jerked his head toward the front door STOP 
START in the kitchen he said STOP 
START leaning his winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl STOP 
START get up STOP 
START there's water in the house STOP 
START she didn't move or say anything STOP 
START her eyes were UNK as if she didn't hear or even see him STOP 
START she had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked STOP 
START her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and UNK the new skin under it red and angry STOP 
START her blond hair was UNK her dress torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection STOP 
START it must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was UNK and bleeding STOP 
START he picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house STOP 
START she was UNK light and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious STOP 
START any UNK suspicion that this was a trick al UNK had thought up was UNK STOP 
START no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him STOP 
START besides she had a sweet face that attracted him STOP 
START he put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table STOP 
START they looked a good deal alike morgan thought STOP 
START both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint UNK of features STOP 
START morgan filled the UNK from the water UNK on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the UNK head and held the edge of the UNK to her mouth STOP 
START she drank UNK and murmured thank you as he lowered her head STOP 
START he stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced her to this condition STOP 
START he had seen a few UNK wagons go through the country the families almost UNK to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two STOP 
START the girl dropped off to sleep STOP 
START morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several UNK of water from the spring which he poured into the copper UNK that he had placed on the stove STOP 
START he brought his winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy STOP 
START who are you and what happened to you asked STOP 
START i'm billy jones the boy answered STOP 
START that's my wife UNK STOP 
START we ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days STOP 
START what are you doing here are we in UNK nodded STOP 
START about five miles north of the line STOP 
START jones sighed as if relieved STOP 
START we've been looking for work but all the UNK have turned us down STOP 
START you mean you dragged your wife all over UNK UNK looking for work demanded STOP 
START the town of UNK only about six miles from here STOP 
START why didn't you go there we didn't want town work jones said STOP 
START this is a mighty empty country morgan said STOP 
START there's only one more ranch three miles north of here STOP 
START you'd have UNK to death if you'd missed both places STOP 
START then we're lucky we got here STOP 
START could you give us a job mr. morgan STOP 
START dan morgan STOP 
START he was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the UNK but he knew nothing about the couple STOP 
START they might kill him in his sleep thinking there was money in the house STOP 
START he dismissed the possibility at once STOP 
START the UNK thin face UNK him STOP 
START it wasn't the face of a killer STOP 
START he wasn't so sure about the boy STOP 
START he hadn't UNK for several weeks his UNK beard giving his face a UNK UNK expression STOP 
START there was more to this than jones had told him STOP 
START they were running from something STOP 
START he'd be an UNK to let them stay he thought but he couldn't send them on either STOP 
START i could use some help morgan said finally but i can't afford to pay you anything STOP 
START i guess you'd better go on in the morning STOP

START morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table STOP 
START when the meal was ready he told jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl STOP 
START he said i've got some supper ready STOP 
START she rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair STOP 
START i'm a mess she said and suddenly she was UNK STOP

START do you take in all the UNK who come by i don't have many UNK coming to my front door he said STOP 
START think you can walk to the table of course STOP 
START she got to her feet staggered and almost fell STOP 
START he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen STOP

START when they were finally satisfied jones said i think he's going to give us work STOP 
START the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself STOP 
START when he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldn't send them on STOP 
START she said i guess the lord looks out for UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START morgan laughed STOP 
START which are you we're not UNK she said STOP 
START that's all i'm sure of STOP 
START she helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark STOP

START he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her STOP

START and using him mike UNK as a UNK to her pride STOP 
START he handed the UNK to dean and kept the pistol STOP 
START stay well back of me he said STOP

START who's that me mike said STOP 
START is that you bill located his man STOP 
START the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight STOP

START mike struck with the UNK of the pistol STOP 
START but the luck that had been running their way left him STOP 
START the guard UNK UNK the blow with his rifle STOP 
START he tried to UNK the rifle around to fire into UNK body STOP 
START mike off balance managed to bat the UNK away a moment before it UNK STOP 
START the bullet went wide STOP 
START mike swung the pistol in a savage UNK STOP 
START this time it connected UNK on the man's temple UNK him STOP 
START the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep UNK were still rolling in the hills STOP 
START the startled horses began UNK on their UNK STOP 
START dean came UNK up STOP 
START are you hit demanded STOP 
START no but the UNK in the fire said STOP 
START there's no chance now of all of us getting away STOP

START then he was on his way at a UNK STOP 
START mike ran down the line UNK UNK UNK with the UNK STOP 
START he lifted a UNK war UNK STOP

START the guerrillas were UNK from their UNK at the west end of the UNK STOP 
START UNK yelled STOP 
START they're UNK the stock UNK in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings STOP 
START he crouched there STOP 
START his UNK had been taken up and repeated STOP 
START the guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the UNK horses STOP 
START all were carrying guns they had seized up but they were UNK or hardly UNK at all STOP 
START UNK and UNK came running from the post STOP 
START they had UNK in their hands STOP 
START they UNK questions that were not answered in the UNK STOP 
START they followed the others toward the east gate STOP 
START beyond the stockade rifles began to UNK as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were UNK STOP 
START mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings STOP 
START he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner STOP 
START the area was deserted STOP 
START a man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to UNK left but he too suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade STOP 
START mike crawled to the door and peered in STOP 
START the orderly room seemed to be deserted STOP 
START a lantern hung from a UNK giving light STOP 
START UNK inside he found that three rifles were UNK in a corner STOP 
START a brace of UNK UNK on UNK hung from a UNK along with ammunition UNK STOP 
START an ammunition case stood open containing UNK which contained powder UNK STOP 
START mike seized a blanket from a UNK in a corner spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his UNK STOP 
START UNK the load he peered from the door STOP 
START his UNK of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the UNK was still clear of guerrillas STOP 
START he looked at the UNK UNK of the supply wagons struck by a new UNK STOP 
START he set his bundle down STOP 
START UNK the lantern from its UNK he shattered its globe with a blow against a post STOP 
START he picked up the powder UNK and ran out STOP 
START bursting paper UNK he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and UNK the contents of the UNK upon it STOP 
START he UNK the blanket again backed off and tossed the lantern with its open UNK beneath the wagon STOP 
START he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house STOP 
START powder flame UNK beneath the wagon STOP 
START the stockade was UNK lighted and the guerrillas UNK him STOP 
START they realized the truth STOP 
START bullets began to snap past him STOP 
START one struck the UNK of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack STOP 
START its force spun him around but he UNK and got into stride again STOP 
START a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety STOP 
START another struck him heavily in the UNK and he went down STOP 
START guerrillas were racing toward him STOP 
START susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them STOP 
START the three of them UNK through the door into the interior and fell in a heap STOP 
START susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door STOP 
START she crouched aside as bullets beat at the UNK chewing into the UNK STOP 
START some tore entirely through the UNK post oak STOP 
START the iron UNK held but the UNK were in danger of being torn from the UNK STOP 
START mike rolled to susan grasped her around the knees dragging her off her feet STOP 
START he UNK over her to UNK her for spent bullets were UNK against the rear walls STOP 
START he peered from a UNK STOP 
START guerrillas were only a dozen yards away UNK the house STOP 
START mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered UNK and fired STOP 
START he dropped a man with the first bullet STOP 
START at the same moment UNK UNK fired the rifle mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit STOP 
START that halted the rush STOP 
START the guerrillas scattered for cover STOP 
START the wagons were burning UNK STOP 
START the UNK had caught fire also STOP 
START the UNK was spreading to the frame buildings STOP

START but what few UNK they found were inadequate STOP 
START many of them in increasing panic came running with water in their hats in a UNK effort STOP 
START both buildings were in flames STOP 
START the heat drove the guerrillas back STOP 
START the roof of the command post began to UNK STOP 
START drag the wagons to the spring UNK yelled STOP 
START run 'em right into the spring of the wagons UNK a massive UNK of flame STOP 
START a sizable supply of powder had been touched off STOP 
START the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings STOP 
START the glow of the fire reached through the UNK in the windows giving light enough to examine UNK wound STOP 
START the bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee UNK an ugly UNK that was forming a pool of blood on the floor STOP 
START but it had missed the bone and had passed on through STOP 
START susan and julia UNK strips from their clothing and bound the injury STOP 
START mike tested the leg and found that he was able to UNK around on it STOP

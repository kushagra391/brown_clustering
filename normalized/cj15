START introduction muscle weakness is now recognized as an UNK though serious UNK of UNK therapy with most of the synthetic UNK UNK in clinical use STOP 
START although UNK have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of UNK weakness this case provides the only example known to us in which UNK afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups STOP 
START the case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed UNK muscular weakness while receiving a variety of UNK for a UNK UNK STOP 
START report of case this patient was a UNK white male UNK who entered the new york hospital for his fourth and terminal admission on june 26 1959 because of UNK weakness and general UNK STOP 
START in 1953 the patient developed an UNK UNK for which 15 blood UNK were given over a period of 4 years STOP 
START UNK was first noted in 1956 and a UNK UNK UNK at that time showed scattered UNK of UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START no additional UNK were necessary after the institution of UNK in july 1957 in an initial dose of 40 mg. daily with gradual UNK to 10 mg. daily STOP 
START this UNK was continued until february 1958 STOP 
START in february 1958 the patient suffered a UNK UNK complicated by pulmonary UNK STOP 
START additional findings at this time included UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the UNK was UNK UNK STOP 
START therapy included UNK and UNK STOP 
START later UNK and salt UNK became necessary to control the UNK of chronic UNK failure STOP 
START because of increasing UNK UNK 8 mg. daily was started on feb. 23 1958 and was continued until july 1958 STOP 
START in september 1958 the patient developed UNK weakness and fatigue which was UNK with UNK of his UNK UNK was UNK UNK STOP 
START in an attempt to reverse the UNK trend by UNK the bone UNK and controlling any UNK component UNK 16 mg. daily was begun on sept. 26 1958 and continued until feb. 18 1959 STOP 
START at first the patient felt stronger and the UNK rose to UNK UNK but on oct. 20 1958 he complained of UNK in in his knees STOP 
START by nov. 8 1958 weakness specifically involving the UNK and UNK UNK was pronounced and a common complaint was difficulty in UNK up on to UNK STOP 
START UNK 30 mg. daily was substituted for UNK from nov. 22 until dec. 1 1958 without any improvement in the weakness STOP 
START serum UNK at this time was UNK UNK per UNK and the UNK was UNK UNK by dec. 1 1958 the weakness in the UNK and UNK muscle groups was UNK worse and it became difficult for the patient to rise UNK from a sitting or UNK position STOP 
START UNK 16 mg. daily was resumed and maintained until feb. 18 1959 STOP 
START UNK was omitted for a UNK period but there was no change in the muscle weakness STOP 
START at this time a detailed UNK examination revealed UNK muscle UNK that was moderate in the hands and feet but marked in the shoulders UNK and UNK UNK with UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START no UNK or UNK defects were found STOP 
START UNK revealed no evidence of lower motor UNK disease STOP 
START thyroid function tests yielded normal results STOP 
START the UNK iodine was UNK mg. and the UNK iodine UNK over the thyroid UNK was UNK in 24 hours with a conversion ratio of UNK STOP 
START a UNK test demonstrated normal absorption of UNK af STOP 
START in february 1959 during the second admission to the new york hospital a UNK specimen of the left UNK showed striking increase in the UNK UNK nuclei and UNK muscle fibers in several sections STOP 
START UNK serum UNK levels remained normal serum UNK UNK UNK was 10 units per UNK per UNK STOP 
START the clinical impression at this time was either muscular UNK or UNK STOP 
START on feb. 12 1959 UNK UNK UNK UNK 20 units daily UNK was started but had to be UNK 3 weeks later because of excessive fluid retention STOP 
START from march 3 to may 1 1949 the patient was maintained on UNK 3 to 6 mg. daily STOP 
START in may 1959 UNK 30 mg. daily replaced the UNK STOP 
START muscle weakness did not improve and the patient needed first a cane then UNK STOP 
START in spite of normal thyroid function tests a trial of UNK 400 mg. daily for one week was given but served only to UNK muscle weakness STOP 
START repeated attempts to UNK UNK entirely were UNK because increased muscle weakness resulted as well as fever UNK UNK anxiety and an UNK of the UNK STOP 
START these reactions were interpreted as being UNK of UNK STOP 
START severe back pain in june 1959 UNK a third hospital admission STOP 
START extensive UNK with partial UNK of UNK was found STOP 
START a UNK diet calcium UNK UNK and UNK failed to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness STOP 
START the terminal hospital admission on june 27 1959 was necessitated by continued weakness and UNK complicated by UNK retention and painful UNK UNK STOP 
START x-ray films of the UNK column showed UNK of the UNK STOP 
START on july 4 1959 the patient developed marked UNK pain and UNK went into shock and died STOP 
START findings at UNK the body was that of a UNK somewhat UNK white man UNK UNK lb. STOP 
START there were UNK UNK and UNK UNK and the mouth was UNK STOP 
START the heart weighed UNK UNK and at the UNK UNK the left and right UNK measured 19 and 3 UNK respectively STOP 
START the UNK arteries were UNK and UNK UNK throughout their courses and the right UNK artery was virtually UNK by a yellow UNK UNK 1.5 cm. UNK to its origin STOP 
START the UNK of the UNK base of the left UNK was replaced by gray UNK tissue over a UNK cm. area STOP 
START the UNK were normal except for thin yellow UNK on the UNK surface of the UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK sections from the UNK base of the left UNK of the heart showed several large areas of replacement of muscle by UNK tissue STOP 
START in addition other sections contained UNK areas of recent UNK UNK that were UNK with UNK STOP 
START many of the UNK fibers were UNK and had large UNK UNK nuclei STOP 
START the UNK of the larger UNK arteries was UNK by UNK tissue containing UNK UNK and UNK cells STOP 
START the UNK surface of the UNK was covered with UNK UNK hard UNK UNK along its entire course and there was a marked UNK of the UNK of the large major UNK arteries STOP 
START in particular the UNK of the right UNK and UNK arteries were virtually UNK and both UNK common UNK arteries were completely UNK STOP 
START the lungs weighed together UNK UNK STOP 
START on the surfaces of both lungs there were UNK UNK measuring up to 3 cm. in diameter STOP 
START the UNK was slightly UNK in the UNK of the left lung and there were several firm gray UNK UNK measuring as large as 3 UNK STOP 
START UNK there was UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK with brown UNK were seen in some of the UNK and the UNK of some of the small arteries was UNK by UNK tissue STOP 
START the firm red UNK weighed UNK UNK and its surface was UNK by UNK small UNK of white material STOP 
START the UNK cells UNK the UNK were prominent and many contained large quantities of UNK STOP 
START some of the UNK contained large numbers of UNK red cells and cells of the UNK series were found in small numbers STOP 
START there were slight UNK and marked UNK STOP 
START the liver weighed UNK UNK was brown in color and the cut surface was UNK by UNK pale areas STOP 
START UNK there was UNK of the central UNK and there was some UNK of adjacent UNK STOP 
START some liver UNK cells contained UNK UNK while others had small amounts of brown UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK contained about 40 UNK of UNK UNK and 3 smooth UNK UNK measuring up to 1 cm. in diameter STOP 
START the UNK of the stomach was UNK and UNK UNK over a 14 cm. area STOP 
START the small and large UNK were filled with gas and the UNK was UNK to about 2 times its normal UNK STOP 
START the small UNK and UNK contained approximately 300 UNK of UNK UNK material and the UNK throughout was UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START a careful search failed to show UNK of any of the UNK vessels STOP 
START UNK the UNK of the stomach showed extensive UNK and contained large numbers of UNK bacterial UNK STOP 
START the UNK was UNK UNK with UNK STOP 
START the UNK of the UNK and UNK showed similar changes and in some areas the UNK was UNK and contained considerable numbers of UNK STOP

START a section of the UNK revealed intense UNK and extensive UNK UNK of the UNK associated with much UNK and many UNK STOP 
START cultures taken from the UNK yielded UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK were pale and weighed right UNK UNK and left UNK UNK STOP

START UNK both UNK showed many small UNK UNK in which there was UNK and UNK UNK UNK UNK and an UNK of UNK and plasma cells STOP 
START occasional UNK contained UNK UNK UNK with UNK STOP 
START throughout there were marked UNK and UNK of UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START these changes were more marked in the UNK right UNK than in the left STOP

START the muscles of the UNK chest wall neck and UNK wall were soft pale and UNK STOP 
START UNK studies of the UNK UNK major UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK showed UNK as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from swelling and UNK to UNK UNK of the muscle fibers STOP 
START these changes were most marked in the UNK and UNK and less evident in the UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START in the UNK and UNK there were many swollen and UNK UNK fibers such as that shown in figure 2 STOP 
START such swollen fibers were deeply UNK contained a few UNK nuclei and showed loss of UNK UNK of UNK and prominent UNK STOP 
START the UNK often involved only a portion of the length of a given fiber and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal STOP 
START as shown in figure 3 the UNK of other fibers was pale UNK or UNK and UNK by UNK STOP 
START UNK cells were UNK absent STOP 
START in association with these changes in the fibers there were striking UNK in the muscle nuclei STOP 
START these were increased both in number and in size contained prominent UNK and were distributed throughout the fiber figs. 2 5 STOP 
START in contrast to the nuclear changes described above another change in muscle nuclei was seen usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct UNK and UNK STOP 
START the nuclei of these fibers as is shown in figures 3 and 4 showed remarkable UNK and were closely UNK forming a UNK structure at either the center or the UNK of the fiber STOP 
START individual nuclei were usually UNK to round though occasionally UNK and frequently small and somewhat UNK STOP 
START at times UNK of 10 to 15 UNK nuclei were also observed STOP

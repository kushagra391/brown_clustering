START ghost town the editor of the inquirer i just wish to UNK inspector UNK and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles STOP 
START we have now a quiet city fewer automobiles less UNK and fewer retail customers shopping in center city STOP 
START good for mr. UNK STOP 
START maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a ghost town STOP 
START UNK big trucks to the editor of the inquirer i worked on the UNK UNK and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn't be an UNK STOP 
START without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future STOP 
START mr. george UNK oct. 30 sounds like a business man who UNK until the last minute to leave his home or shop STOP 
START the trucks today help pay for this highway STOP 
START they try to keep within the speed limits STOP 
START although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against UNK the road STOP 
START out of school at 14 to the editor of the inquirer the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter UNK instead of UNK STOP 
START such kids only wind up among the UNK on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden STOP 
START there are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates but not for the UNK STOP 
START what we need is more vocational training in high schools not more UNK STOP 
START two UNK to the editor of the inquirer i suppose i am missing some elementary point but i honestly cannot see how two UNK can make a right am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because russia is STOP 
START will our bombs be UNK or will their fallout be less UNK to future generations of children an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic UNK we now have is more than adequate to UNK any military objective required of it STOP 
START as i see it if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapons we now have at least the bombs can UNK all the UNK that is necessary STOP 
START why do we need bigger and better bombs repeat two UNK do not make a right STOP 
START we UNK not to the editor of the inquirer everyone should take time to read martin UNK UNK a mighty UNK is our god STOP 
START especially the first half of the third verse out of the race to the editor of the inquirer to our UNK shame we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on hiroshima and UNK STOP 
START having led the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race STOP 
START are we to be the master of the atom or will the atom be our master and destroy us trust UNK the editor of the inquirer just because UNK UNK new boss of british UNK was educated in the united states is no reason to think he isn't a red STOP 
START we have quite a few UNK specimens of our own STOP 
START if we go all UNK over this newest castro until he proves he isn't we've got rocks in our heads STOP 
START how many times must we get burned before we learn and u.n. to the editor of the inquirer just to remind the communists that the bombs dropped on japan were to end a war not start one STOP 
START the war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides STOP 
START intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on japan london or UNK harbor STOP 
START that is why the united nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without UNK to war STOP 
START russia has showed its intentions by UNK bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world STOP 
START why aren't the soviets UNK from the u.n. tribute to the editor of the inquirer while better late than never may have certain merits the UNK award of the UNK prize for peace to the late UNK hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation STOP 
START had it been UNK while the secretary general of the united nations was living unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in UNK a difficult and in many ways UNK task STOP 
START according to one report however mr. hammarskjold was considered too controversial a figure to warrant UNK of the UNK honor last spring STOP 
START actually of course that label controversial applied only because he was carrying out the UNK given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the UNK of the soviet union STOP 
START at khrushchev's door therefore can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be UNK STOP 
START it is well for us to remember that a UNK on a UNK never can UNK for flowers UNK while they still can be enjoyed STOP 
START as has happened so often in the past the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and UNK STOP 
START people to people to the editor of the inquirer just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and UNK UNK driver UNK UNK for providing a UNK example of people to people good will STOP 
START if only this could be done more often with such UNK results many of the earth's big problems would UNK to the UNK they really are STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START thanks for your good coverage of UNK visit too answer east river drive to the editor of the inquirer your continuing UNK concerning the UNK UNK are valuable several pertinent considerations deserve recognition STOP 
START one of the problems associated with the UNK stems from the basic idea STOP 
START we UNK a large percentage of the cars across the river twice STOP 
START they start on the east side of the UNK have to cross over to the west to use the UNK and cross over again to the east at their UNK STOP 
START bridges UNK and UNK are the most common methods of river UNK STOP 
START each one of these is by its nature a UNK point or a point of natural UNK STOP 
START we should avoid these UNK points or putting it another way keep cars starting and ending on the east side of the river on the east side STOP 
START this can be accomplished by several logical steps 1 UNK the east river drive at least one lane STOP 
START 2 so UNK it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems STOP 
START 3 paint continuous lane UNK and UNK overhead UNK lights as on our bridges STOP 
START one additional lane would then be UNK with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the east river drive by fifty percent STOP 
START 4 this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the UNK UNK and without destroying the natural beauty of the east river drive STOP 
START shadow over washington square to the editor of the inquirer i wish to advocate two drastic changes in washington square 1 STOP 
START take away george UNK statue STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START replace it with the statue of one or another of the world's famous UNK STOP 
START there's no sense in being reminded of times that were STOP 
START washington square seems not part of a free land STOP 
START it may remind one of russia china or east berlin it can't remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldiers fought for STOP 
START the UNK park commission will no doubt approve my two proposals because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square STOP 
START the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but it's a very good start on the road to UNK the commission has posted signs in washington square saying the feeding of birds is UNK in this square STOP 
START UNK park commission does each UNK of the UNK of city government reach out and UNK at whatever it UNK or considers an UNK birds don't belong in a square or park what does are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature STOP 
START the trees are their homes the commission does not share such UNK STOP 
START the whole official city apparently has an intense hatred toward birds STOP 
START UNK and UNK are scared off by UNK from city hall STOP 
START just a preliminary measure STOP 
START if any are left presently we may expect to see signs specifically UNK the feeding of them too STOP 
START the city government is not united in an UNK UNK drive to UNK out UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START indeed no STOP 
START let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on john and jane UNK lest one piece of bread be placed UNK and one bird survive STOP 
START of course in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say how come your motive wants this UNK done in this small way do the leaders of a city or of a nation UNK the masses to watching or even UNK UNK and death upon even their fellow men STOP 
START one means to help the birds occurs to me let the UNK that ring over washington square twice daily UNK any piece of music but one STOP 
START let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began the UNK UNK with me STOP 
START we will know and he will know to whom it is rendered what the birds would ask not UNK but UNK to the editor of the inquirer there is a trend today to UNK the fact that americans are too soft STOP 
START unfortunately those who would remedy our UNK seek to do so with UNK STOP 
START they are working on the wrong part of our UNK STOP 
START it is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft STOP 
START ashamed of our wealth and power afraid of so-called world opinion and UNK to peace we have allowed our UNK to lead to UNK policies STOP 
START when we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit UNK when we become strong enough to resist any more UNK towards socialism in our own nation when we recognize that our enemy is communism not war and when we realize that UNK to communists do not insure peace or freedom then and only then will we no longer be soft STOP 
START america doesn't need to UNK she needs to stand up UNK column business UNK views to the editor the new column by UNK UNK regarding business UNK is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit STOP 
START however he states UNK the UNK in business are far less significant than the UNK in labor STOP 
START i must in UNK take issue with his UNK primarily because the so-called UNK in labor unions were very much connected with business UNK STOP 
START the area most UNK commented on during the mcclellan UNK had to do with UNK contracts STOP 
START these arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes STOP 
START a UNK arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the UNK as by UNK labor leaders demanding tribute STOP 
START anyone familiar with the details of the mcclellan UNK must at once realize that the UNK arrangements UNK employer profits far more than they UNK the earnings of the UNK labor leaders STOP 
START further it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the UNK act STOP

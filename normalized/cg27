START in UNK he has said natural or UNK objects kept coming into my head but i would UNK them UNK STOP 
START moreover he organized the movement of his forms within his UNK shaped space into highly complex UNK used UNK of color value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors STOP 
START the worthy UNK seeing these pictures said in a tone of UNK UNK but you are really an artist of the UNK tradition did not realize it at the time but it was true STOP 
START his UNK abstraction made up of smooth UNK UNK acting upon each other with great tension won helion much UNK during the UNK STOP 
START the play of novel lighting effects also entered into these UNK whose controlled power and varied activity made them well worth UNK STOP 
START as UNK work showed more and more UNK for the world of man and nature the pure UNK expressed some disapproval UNK UNK UNK and alexander UNK at the time gave him their UNK STOP 
START his UNK nowadays bore titles frankly UNK them to be figures in space or blue figure or pink figure they had vaguely heads and feet STOP 
START UNK in shows in london in UNK and in new york the following year the new more UNK UNK were much favored in the circles of the UNK as UNK UNK of great intellectual UNK STOP 
START at this period the UNK old helion was UNK as one of the mature leaders of the modern movement according to herbert read and in the direct line of descent from UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START in america UNK UNK observed that unlike the UNK school helion sought a return path to the UNK of nature within the framework of abstract art STOP 
START it is notable that at this time he was writing with UNK of UNK and UNK way of filling space STOP 
START abstract art was still the right path for him he held instead of continuing as an art of reduction it must grow must make a place for the contributions of the UNK and UNK as well as for those of the early UNK and UNK STOP 
START later helion wrote of this phase for years i built for myself a subtle instrument of relationships colors and forms without a name STOP 
START i played on it my secret songs UNK passionate and peaceful STOP 
START but his own work was UNK further STOP 
START the extreme limitations he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly UNK and cold STOP 
START he was engaged in constant experiments that UNK for new directions STOP 
START where would it all lead himself did not know as he said in UNK STOP 
START but he was afraid of the future he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration a functional art of some kind STOP 
START during the UNK the UNK the german UNK group of industrial designers and the new UNK all had the dream of some well ordered utopia or welfare state in which their neat and logical UNK might find their proper place STOP 
START but whereas the postwar american UNK seem to helion to be determined to escape from the real world or simply to rebel against it the ordered UNK which he and his associates of the UNK were painting UNK the hope of improving things STOP 
START we were possessed by UNK of a new civilization to come very pure and elevated he has said in fact some ideal form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of UNK STOP 
START instead of this the UNK witnessed a tragic economic depression the rise of UNK UNK in europe the UNK civil war in UNK STOP 
START very much the political man helion felt himself deeply affected by the increasingly UNK atmosphere of france and all europe whose foundations seemed to him more and more UNK STOP 
START in UNK he decided to UNK to america STOP 
START the UNK america was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute the last best hope for civilization STOP 
START helion also hoped that america's UNK of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works STOP 
START i arrived in the united states with the idea of establishing myself there more or less permanently and finding UNK for new UNK STOP 
START in new york he was well received by what was then only a small brave band of UNK artists including alexander UNK george k. l. morris de UNK UNK and a few others STOP 
START after a year in a studio on UNK square having married an american girl who was a native of virginia helion moved to a village in the blue ridge mountains where he produced some of the most UNK of his abstract UNK STOP 
START the UNK world scene at the time of the UNK UNK continued to trouble his mind even in his remote virginia studio STOP 
START fear possessed me and the certainty of war he has related STOP 
START i truly smelled blood death UNK of UNK everywhere STOP 
START in UNK he UNK to finish some last abstract paintings a UNK frieze with a flying figure and a fallen figure UNK which went to the chicago art institute and is considered by him the most successful of his UNK in early UNK a fallen figure of very ominous character which concluded his abstract phase STOP 
START i knew i was carrying on with abstraction to its very end for me he said of the two UNK output in virginia STOP 
START with those paintings of big UNK UNK down he felt he could stop STOP 
START they were in effect his last testament to UNK art STOP 
START he had taken out first papers for american UNK after war came to europe he decided to return to france arriving there in january 1940 STOP 
START i hated the war he said but thought i ought to go because i was perhaps one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it STOP 
START in june 1940 sergeant helion with a company of reserve troops waiting to go into battle was UNK the hills south of the UNK river when the war suddenly rolled in upon him STOP 
START its first UNK was a long UNK column of UNK riding in farm wagons or pushing UNK STOP 
START his company then carried out a confused UNK movement until it was surrounded by the germans a few days before france UNK STOP 
START after a sort of death march during four days without food helion and his UNK were UNK by UNK to a labor camp at an estate farm in east germany STOP 
START a year later they were removed to a UNK in the harbor of UNK STOP 
START at the time of his capture helion had on his person a UNK he had bought at UNK in new york STOP 
START when he was stripped UNK and UNK by his guards his UNK UNK was seized and thrown on a pile of UNK goods to be UNK STOP 
START it was then i knew that they were making war against man the individual within who questioned things when given orders STOP 
START at UNK the UNK artist who had studied german was chosen to serve as UNK and clerk in the office of the UNK commander STOP 
START in secret he also acted as a member of the UNK central committee which UNK UNK planned a few UNK and maintained a hidden control over the UNK french UNK STOP 
START in the UNK helion came to know and love his UNK most of them plain folk who in their UNK showed true courage and ran great UNK to help each other STOP 
START how much they UNK him is shown by the fact that their underground committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped to escape STOP 
START in the prison UNK black market civilian clothes were quietly bought and UNK papers were devised for him long weeks the plan for his flight was UNK STOP 
START every morning UNK of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories STOP 
START one evening while a UNK game was being played in the yard among the prisoners remaining there a UNK UNK was staged just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from work STOP 
START as helion wrote afterward their UNK followed STOP 
START four hands were stretched toward me by my UNK behind me STOP 
START UNK held my UNK held a UNK with my money and papers and david held nothing but their fingers STOP 
START they felt rough and kind and warm STOP 
START at this moment the UNK hit the ground STOP 
START UNK ran toward UNK with fists raised STOP 
START the guards all rushed up to UNK UNK his prison UNK helion shot through the gates now UNK in civilian UNK and with the UNK of a UNK worker STOP 
START riding trains UNK UNK on trucks across germany UNK through UNK UNK with the help of secret UNK he eventually reached UNK france and by the winter of 1943 was back in virginia STOP 
START he wrote to escape from a prison camp required a very special state of mind only UNK of UNK but a faith a hope that is even stronger STOP 
START i left behind me brave men whom UNK had UNK of all hope STOP 
START they too loved their families UNK for their villages yet lacked the faith that drove one to dare the fearful chance of escape STOP 
START it was a time of UNK for him STOP 
START even the most rational of men under great stress may be UNK by a new faith and behave like UNK STOP 
START helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the UNK of his UNK in UNK 13 UNK as to his own UNK will and love of life STOP 
START after that he declared to return to freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and UNK it STOP 
START in prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from life his guards his UNK in misery STOP 
START now all his desires centered on UNK and singing of the UNK and yet beautiful world of men and objects so long UNK from me by a barbed wire fence STOP 
START and he added during the many months in prison camp all abstract images vanished from my mind STOP 
START before leaving for america he happened to see his old friend jean UNK and UNK to him his new UNK STOP 
START UNK protested but it is impossible in the way of representation has already been done by the old masters STOP 
START helion however clung to the belief that in UNK from the UNK i had also escaped from abstraction STOP 
START while UNK in his virginia home he wrote a book recording his prison experiences and escape entitled they shall not have me published originally in UNK english by UNK co. of new york in 1943 the book was received by the press as a work of UNK literary power and one of the most realistic accounts of world war 2 from the french side STOP 
START it was very widely read too the author who seemed the UNK of UNK rising spirit of resistance to her UNK was much UNK for his daring military action STOP 
START but when he showed his new UNK pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp they paid him no UNK and drew long faces STOP 
START between 1944 and 1947 helion had a series of UNK shows at the paul UNK gallery in new york and in paris of his new realistic pictures STOP 
START they UNK the figures of human beings UNK from his UNK since the UNK STOP 
START these new pictures UNK on the familiar and commonplace objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking about as the things they missed most hence associated with the sense of lost freedom the cafe at the corner the newspaper UNK the girls in UNK and windows along the street the UNK french bread they lacked the cigarettes denied them STOP 
START one of the pictures was of a man with hat drawn over his face UNK lighting a cigarette were of men UNK their hats to each other carrying UNK with UNK reading newspapers or simply showing UNK of bread spread out STOP

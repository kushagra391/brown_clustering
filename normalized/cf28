START the slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under john UNK UNK STOP 
START an excellent crop was expected that year STOP 
START william who lived in neighboring st. UNK parish had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year STOP 
START giffen advised acceptance of this plan UNK the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation STOP 
START if sold then the land and improvements might bring only UNK STOP 
START early in january UNK he had a conference with henry and william in new orleans and upon learning of UNK intention henry UNK calmly but firmly with his brother STOP 
START the emancipation plan would not only be UNK to all the UNK he contended but would be a form of cruelty UNK on the UNK negroes STOP 
START they were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation and louisiana law required their removal from the state STOP 
START UNK refused to accept money for slave property but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his negroes to the north involved suggestion that giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic since no UNK would take the risk of having negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves STOP 
START henry UNK his UNK although both he and william were UNK with their yankee brother STOP 
START william who did not write to UNK told giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year he would sue UNK to protect his interests STOP 
START palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage UNK during the transition period before emancipation STOP 
START if william wished to continue operations for a year why not simply leave the negroes UNK and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex age STOP 
START a disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme STOP 
START their having family ties on our plantation the adjoining one would be a stronger UNK STOP 
START when he heard of his UNK anger palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages STOP 
START if not he was willing to UNK to UNK wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim STOP 
START william was UNK on one point under no circumstances would he allow the negroes to remain on the plantation with his and UNK slaves if they were told of their coming freedom STOP 
START knowing the UNK that existed in louisiana against increasing the number of free negroes giffen suggested that palfrey bring them to boston at once and then send them on to UNK STOP 
START lacking specific instructions he agreed to UNK condition STOP 
START in march there was a division of the slaves and giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible STOP 
START of the UNK slaves giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty twelve of whom were females STOP 
START i considered that your views would be best carried out he explained by taking women whose UNK will of course be free more fully extend the UNK of emancipation STOP 
START i have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of conscience justice STOP 
START the ages of the slaves ranged from UNK for an old house servant to an UNK UNK child STOP 
START if palfrey ever had any doubts about the UNK of slavery they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited STOP 
START this cold UNK of human worth in a legal paper UNK of UNK or humanity was all he needed STOP 
START each human being known only by a given name had a cash value STOP

START in UNK any claim to the value of the slave property palfrey was giving up close to UNK STOP 
START UNK brothers each received lots of sixteen negroes and for UNK purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at UNK STOP 
START thus twenty black souls were to remain ignorant of their UNK journey to the land of free men STOP

START despite UNK warning palfrey still had plans for UNK his slaves in louisiana STOP

START according to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed STOP 
START palfrey UNK the state legislature to UNK the requirement STOP 
START otherwise freedom would mean removal from the state in which as the place of their past residence from birth or for many years it would be UNK for their advantage to be at liberty to remain STOP 
START on march 11 the louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition STOP 
START news of the legislative UNK appeared in the new orleans papers and henry and william became UNK by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance STOP 
START henry UNK into UNK office waving a copy of the new orleans UNK shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair and that it would reach the ears of the people on the plantation and make them restless unhappy STOP 
START his UNK anger caused palfrey genuine concern for he had imposed a UNK mission upon himself to free his slaves and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue STOP 
START when giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from john palfrey UNK readily UNK UNK that in a matter of dollars and cents his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him STOP 
START in view of these difficulties palfrey decided to go to louisiana STOP 
START giffen had already urged him to journey south if only for a few days to clear up matters STOP 
START his duties as massachusetts secretary of state obliged him to wait until the UNK of the legislature in UNK STOP 
START palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time and left for new orleans UNK UNK a special UNK of providence that he might be allowed to see his family again STOP 
START during his journey palfrey stopped off to see two UNK STOP

START at UNK kentucky palfrey consulted with UNK m. clay on the same subject but with no apparent result STOP 
START despite his UNK about his personal safety UNK reception in new orleans was more than UNK STOP 
START instead of the expected UNK due to the nature of his mission he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark on whom i had no sort of claim have had many more invitations than i could accept STOP 
START he later told UNK UNK UNK of the marked attention and UNK with which the new orleans gentlemen and the UNK UNK greeted him STOP 
START the memory of this southern UNK did not survive the trials of coming UNK years and civil war STOP 
START UNK UNK contains a UNK account of two UNK days spent among the UNK of UNK many of whom were UNK passionate people much excited by what they heard of my plans STOP 
START he proceeded with his task UNK in his UNK at least before the passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high STOP 
START palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men but not the women to choose freely whether or not to go north for freedom STOP 
START the women by remaining behind condemned their children born and UNK to UNK STOP 
START he had a short private talk with each adult slave STOP 
START only one objected but palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others STOP 
START all the slaves joined in UNK that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the UNK season so that they could get in their own little produce STOP 
START palfrey agreed slaves were to remain as wage UNK for his account STOP 
START UNK threat that under no conditions would he allow UNK slaves to mix with his own was not carried out for the plantation continued in operation as before STOP 
START palfrey returned to massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment my conscience STOP

START the plantation was sold in january UNK and palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two UNK wages STOP 
START giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work new owner at UNK declined to enter into any UNK arrangement STOP 
START on march 21 UNK the bark UNK weighed anchor at new orleans while on the UNK henry and william palfrey waved farewell to their father's former UNK who must have looked back at the UNK shore with UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START not all of UNK slaves were aboard the UNK STOP 
START giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants STOP 
START two of these were included in UNK lot STOP 
START giffen filed a petition for permission to UNK four slaves all more than fifty years old with the st. UNK parish police jury STOP 
START after an initial rejection which he attributed to a general excitement against UNK and emancipation giffen UNK the right individuals on the jury and got the permission without further delay STOP 
START when the negroes landed at boston a month later they were of course no longer slaves STOP 
START slavery was UNK in massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of UNK which declared all men are born free and equal STOP

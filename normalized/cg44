START the late r. g. UNK a philosopher whose work has proved helpful to many students of literature once wrote are all though many of us are UNK enough to wish to deny it in far closer sympathy with the art of the UNK and UNK than with UNK and UNK or even shakespeare and UNK STOP 
START by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present and enjoy the UNK of UNK and japanese UNK the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place STOP 
START the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art to UNK and dislike the art of the recent past and wholly to ignore everything else STOP 
START one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous UNK that is likely to obscure the UNK of the general public of the newspaper critic and of the creative artist himself STOP 
START there results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the contemporary STOP 
START such study may take many forms STOP 
START the study of ideas in literature is one of these STOP 
START of course it goes without saying that no student of ideas can UNK ignore the contemporary scene STOP 
START he will frequently return to it STOP 
START the UNK contrasts and UNK UNK when past and present are UNK together are UNK and the one is often understood through the other STOP 
START when we assert the value of such study we find ourselves committed to an important assumption STOP 
START most students of literature whether they call themselves scholars or critics are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them STOP 
START many will add that we may find our enjoyment UNK by our understanding STOP 
START this understanding of course may in its turn take many forms and some of these especially those most interesting to the student of comparative literature are essentially historical STOP 
START but the historian of literature need not UNK his attention to biography or to UNK questions of form texture or technique STOP 
START he may also consider ideas STOP 
START it is true that this distinction between style and idea often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or UNK one another and sometimes appear as expressions of the same insight STOP 
START but in general we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention toward one or the other STOP 
START at this point a working definition of idea is in order although our first definition will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed STOP 
START the term idea refers to our more UNK or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the UNK of UNK or emotional experience STOP 
START it is through such reflection that literature approaches philosophy STOP 
START an idea let us say may be roughly defined as a theme or UNK with which our reflection may be concerned STOP 
START in this essay we are along with most historians interested in the more general or more UNK ideas that are so to speak UNK large in history of literature where they UNK continually STOP 
START outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself including the many UNK that have been advanced over the centuries secondary notions such as the UNK of man the UNK of man and the dignity of man STOP 
START one might indeed argue that the history of ideas in so far as it includes the UNK must center on UNK of human nature and that the great periods of literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference to the images of human nature that they succeed in UNK STOP 
START we need not to be sure expect to find such ideas in every piece of literature STOP 
START an idea of the sort that we have in mind although of necessity readily available to imagination is more general in UNK than most poetic or literary images especially those appearing in lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience STOP 
START thus UNK my love is like a red red rose and UNK the UNK UNK UNK purple of thunder although clearly intelligible in content hardly present ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned STOP 
START on the other hand UNK the UNK salt UNK sea taken in its context certainly does so STOP 
START understanding a work of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or UNK STOP 
START thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to UNK a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or UNK of its period STOP 
START again he may discover UNK within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere and at other times in various ways STOP 
START our understanding will very probably require both these UNK STOP 
START very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or belongs to some way of thought UNK as a school or an UNK i.e. a complex or UNK of ideas occurring together with sufficient UNK to warrant identification STOP 
START thus ideas like grace salvation and providence cluster together in traditional christianity STOP 
START usually the work studied offers us a special or even an UNK rendering or treatment of the ideas in question so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions of an UNK or mode of thought STOP 
START accordingly we may speak of the UNK peculiar to UNK poems or the type of UNK present in UNK UNK and we may find that describing such UNK or such UNK and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise STOP 
START after all shelley is no orthodox or UNK UNK and even his romantic UNK can be distinguished from that of his UNK STOP 
START again UNK attitude of UNK which colors his ideal of UNK is far from characteristic of a UNK UNK like UNK UNK whose gentle UNK is almost christian comparable to the patience expressed in UNK UNK on his own blindness STOP 
START in recent years we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters of this history have to do with UNK or UNK aspects of literature and the arts although these aspects should be studied in conjunction with the history of philosophy of religion and of the sciences STOP 
START when these fields are UNK together important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of UNK influence a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions primarily literary religious and philosophical but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even to some extent with science STOP 
START here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives of the UNK research STOP 
START let us quote once more from r. g. UNK history is properly concerned with the actions of human beings regarded from the outside an action is an event or series of events occurring in the physical world from the inside it is the carrying into action of a certain thought the UNK business is to UNK to the inside of the actions with which he is dealing and UNK or rather UNK the thoughts which constituted them STOP 
START it is a characteristic of thoughts that in UNK them we come UNK UNK to understand why they were thought STOP 
START such an understanding although it must seek to be sympathetic is not a matter of intuition STOP 
START history has this in common with every other science that the historian is not allowed to claim any single piece of knowledge except where he can justify his claim by UNK to himself in the first place and UNK to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration the grounds upon which it is based STOP 
START this is what was meant above by describing history as UNK STOP 
START the knowledge in virtue of which a man is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves about certain events STOP 
START it is obvious that the historian who UNK to UNK the ideas that have UNK human behavior throughout a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of his central and major concerns by no means a mere supplement or UNK of significant historical research STOP 
START the student of ideas and their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of transition which are at the same time patterns of transformation whereby ideas pass from one area of activity to another STOP 
START let us survey for a moment the development of modern thought turning our attention from the UNK toward the revolutionary and romantic movements that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades STOP 
START we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from its UNK in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the arts STOP 
START finally we may note that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is at present widespread STOP 
START no one will deny that such broad developments and UNK are of great UNK interest and the study of ideas in literature would be UNK incomplete without frequent reference to them STOP 
START still we must remember that we cannot construct and justify UNK of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence moving between such areas as theology philosophy political thought and literature STOP 
START the actual moments of contact are UNK important STOP 
START these moments are historical events in the lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concerned STOP 
START perhaps the most powerful and most frequently UNK literary influence on the western world has been that of the old and new testament STOP 
START certainly one of the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders have read and interpreted the bible STOP 
START this reading and the comments that it UNK constitute the influence STOP 
START a contrast of the UNK reading of let us say st. UNK john UNK and thomas jefferson all three of whom found in such study a real source of UNK can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression STOP 
START in much the same way we recognize the importance of UNK UNK with UNK and UNK of UNK study of plato's UNK and of UNK enthusiastic UNK of the writings of many UNK and UNK from plato to UNK and william UNK through which so many abstract ideas were brought to the attention of english men of letters STOP 
START we may also recognize cases in which the poets have influenced the UNK and even indirectly the scientists STOP 
START english philosopher samuel UNK debt to UNK and meredith is a recent interesting example as also a. n. UNK understanding of the english UNK chiefly shelley and UNK STOP 
START UNK profound UNK for the insights of the greek UNK indicates a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy STOP 
START again the student of UNK UNK will find a fascinating if to our minds UNK anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the natural UNK of the UNK in UNK who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept from the philosopher UNK STOP 
START here an important UNK is in order STOP 
START we must avoid the notion suggested to some people by examples such as those just mentioned that ideas are units in some way comparable to UNK or UNK that can be passed intact from one group of people to another or even for that matter from one individual to another STOP

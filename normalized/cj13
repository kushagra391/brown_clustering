START some of the features of the top portions of figure 1 and figure 2 were mentioned in discussing table 1 STOP 
START first the onset profile UNK across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls STOP 
START in contrast 20 of the 21 lines in the completion profile excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls are UNK and extend over a much shorter period approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls STOP 
START the maturity chart for each sex UNK clearly that onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence STOP 
START second for both sexes the 21 UNK lines in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile STOP 
START although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to UNK early table 1 there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely UNK UNK STOP 
START third the process of UNK is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls a fact which UNK data for other groups of children STOP 
START the onset profile and completion profile are constructed to serve as norms for children STOP 
START it is convenient to UNK a child's onset ages and completion ages as advanced moderate UNK or delayed according to whether the child's age equivalent dots appeared to the left of upon or to the right of the appropriate short UNK line STOP 
START when a dot appears close to the end of the UNK line the moderate UNK may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking UNK the mean age STOP 
START such UNK may be called somewhat advanced or somewhat delayed as the case may be UNK moderate for dots upon or close to the mean STOP 
START in the lower portion of each chart the skeletal age hand of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified STOP 
START there the middle one of the three curves UNK mean skeletal age for the maturity series boys and girls STOP 
START the upper curve UNK the mean plus one standard deviation and the lower curve represents the mean UNK one standard deviation STOP 
START thus a child's skeletal age dots may be classified as advanced when they appear above the middle curve moderate when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve and delayed when they appear below the lower curve STOP 
START to UNK the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of UNK UNK level of growth centers STOP 
START first the upper portion requires series of films for every child consisting of those from hand UNK shoulder knee and foot STOP 
START the lower portion UNK only films of hand STOP 
START second the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long short and round bones of the five regions STOP 
START the lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones UNK since only two long bones are included in hand and UNK as a region STOP 
START third the upper portion deals with only two UNK of UNK level onset and completion STOP 
START the lower portion UNK the full complement of intermediate maturity UNK of each hand center as well as their onset and completion STOP 
START fourth the two UNK are for the most part widely separated UNK with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center STOP 
START the lower portion provides a UNK at any stage between infancy and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and skeletal ages hand of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified using only those skeletal ages which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile STOP 
START it may be assumed that differences in UNK due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body STOP 
START accordingly maturity level UNK by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart respectively should be somewhat similar since skeletal age UNK are dependent upon UNK during infancy and upon UNK during adolescence STOP 
START it is clear that there are some differences in the UNK but there is substantial agreement STOP 
START since a skeletal age UNK can be made at any age during growth from UNK shoulder knee or foot as well as hand it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal UNK progress during childhood STOP 
START as stated earlier in the paper UNK and UNK particularly the former provide a different tool or UNK of UNK in UNK development each within a limited age period STOP 
START such an UNK or UNK are needed as means of UNK specific periods of delay in skeletal UNK progress STOP 
START it was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of UNK of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables 1 and 2 STOP 
START as one approach to doing this figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2 STOP 
START the differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into UNK by means of a series of UNK STOP 
START the data for boy 34 appear in figure 3 and for girl 2 in figure 4 STOP 
START the UNK system used in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers STOP 
START the dot on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center STOP 
START the tip of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center STOP 
START thus the UNK of the dots and tips respectively indicate individual UNK of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls STOP 
START the direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at completion from the level at onset STOP 
START when the dot and tip coincide the classification used in this paper is same schedule STOP 
START the length of the arrow indicates amount of UNK or acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables STOP 
START the difference between the sequence of onset of UNK for the sexes UNK the UNK sequence in figures 3 and 4 STOP 
START this difference is readily UNK by referring to table 1 STOP 
START for example arrow 17 in figure 3 UNK the UNK UNK UNK for boy 34 whereas the same UNK for girl 2 is UNK by arrow 18 in figure 4 STOP 
START for the boy this UNK was UNK delayed at onset but near the mean at completion STOP 
START thus the span of its UNK was UNK and the UNK ability to catch up in UNK is demonstrated STOP 
START in contrast for the girl the UNK was slightly advanced at onset and delayed at completion STOP 
START obviously the UNK for her may have occurred at any point between onset and completion STOP 
START the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 shows that UNK may have occurred for her during the UNK period STOP 
START length of the shaft of these UNK may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in table 1 STOP 
START we have attempted to UNK the extensive task of UNK onset ages and completion ages of each child more than UNK values for the entire group by UNK figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center STOP 
START figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of UNK the results for each growth center STOP 
START forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this UNK have been included in the UNK STOP 
START the principles used in making each arrow for figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the UNK STOP 
START one growth center in a short bone UNK UNK of the second finger was chosen as an example for discussion here primarily because UNK fusion the maturity UNK for completion in long and short bones occurs in this center for girls near the UNK and for boys near their comparable UNK stage STOP 
START its completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity UNK to include in studies of growth UNK patterns and health during adolescence STOP 
START the following summary based on figures 5 and 6 is an example of one way of UNK the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center STOP 
START at the top of figure 5 for example the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in table 1 STOP 
START the 34 UNK UNK onset age plus completion age UNK have been UNK in an onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest onset of the 34 girls STOP 
START the growth center UNK here in the UNK UNK of the second finger is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones STOP 
START the mean onset age was UNK months table 1 and the average span of the UNK stage was UNK months STOP 
START the correlation table 2 between onset age and completion age was UNK and that between onset age and span was UNK STOP 
START with due consideration for the limits of precision in UNK expected rate of change in UNK of girls age 2 years and the known variations in rate of UNK of these children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement each arrow with a shaft length of four months or less was selected as indicating same schedule at onset and completion for this particular UNK STOP 
START accordingly girls 31 29 UNK 21 26 13 3 4 14 32 24 25 34 23 6 15 22 and 16 may be said to have the same schedule at onset and completion STOP 
START it seems clear from the UNK shape of the series of UNK in figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late UNK and UNK for the 34 girls STOP 
START accordingly if UNK fusion occurs in this UNK near UNK early and late UNK might have been UNK rather precisely at the time of onset of UNK for the 18 girls with same schedule STOP 
START as an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which UNK four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure girl 2 had a delayed onset and further delayed completion STOP 
START it is of interest that her UNK was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group STOP 
START a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boys would UNK quite a different conclusion about the UNK value of onset age in UNK their UNK of the UNK stage STOP 
START boys 32 23 31 17 30 19 and 24 had same schedule at onset and completion early UNK of the UNK stage would appear possible for only seven boys STOP 
START boy 34 like girl 2 did not have same schedule arrow UNK the line UNK the mean STOP 
START the dot on his arrow indicates early onset and the tip indicates relatively later completion STOP 
START after the 42 figures had been drawn like figures 5 and 6 UNK of the onset ages and completion ages were UNK from them STOP

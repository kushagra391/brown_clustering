START the turn of the century or to be more precise the two decades UNK and following it marks a great change in the history of early english scholarship STOP 
START at the bottom of this change were great UNK forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the historian STOP 
START in archaeology for example the contributions of frederick UNK and UNK smith to the various volumes of the UNK county histories raised the discipline from the status of an UNK UNK to that of the most valuable single tool of the early english historian STOP 
START and with the publication of e. t. UNK archaeology of the anglo-saxon UNK the student was presented with an organized synthesis of the UNK data then known STOP 
START what was true for archaeology was also true of UNK studies STOP 
START the value of UNK in the reconstruction of early english history had long been recognized STOP 
START UNK in fact had been UNK UNK for this purpose from the time of UNK UNK STOP 
START without a precise knowledge of UNK UNK however it is UNK whether their use was not more often a source of confusion and error than anything else STOP 
START even in the nineteenth century such accomplished UNK as UNK and guest were led into what now seem UNK errors because of their failure to recognize that modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical UNK development STOP 
START it was therefore not until the publication of UNK UNK the settlement of the south and east UNK and UNK UNK dr. guest and the english UNK of south britain that a scientific basis for UNK studies was established STOP 
START diplomatic is another area for which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern standards of scholarship STOP 
START although because of the important achievements of nineteenth century scholars in the field of UNK criticism the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology and UNK the editorial principles laid down by stevenson in his great edition of UNK and in his UNK UNK were a distinct improvement upon those of his UNK and remain UNK upon today STOP 
START in sum it can be said that the techniques and standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century STOP 
START and it is this particularly the establishment of archaeology and UNK studies on a scientific basis which are immediately pertinent to the saxon shore STOP 
START almost inevitably the first result of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and in many cases the conclusions of the oxford school of UNK freeman and particularly green regarding the nature of the anglo-saxon UNK of britain STOP 
START even before the century was out the tide of reaction had set in STOP 
START charles UNK in the introduction and notes to his splendid edition of UNK UNK some early doubts concerning the elaborate UNK they raised up over the slim foundations afforded by the traditional UNK of the UNK STOP 
START it was UNK in fact who UNK the much quoted remark mr. green indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the UNK and had watched every step of their subsequent progress STOP 
START sir henry UNK writing in UNK put himself firmly in the UNK tradition by UNK the UNK of the west saxon UNK STOP 
START early in the present century w. h. stevenson continued the attack with a savage article against guest STOP 
START following him in varying degrees of UNK were UNK shore UNK UNK thomas UNK and f. g. UNK STOP 
START by 1913 UNK lot could begin an article UNK la UNK de la UNK par UNK UNK with the words UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK la UNK du UNK UNK de la UNK de la UNK STOP 
START it is also worthy of note that lot cited both UNK and UNK with favor in that article STOP 
START it would seem that the wheel had turned full circle STOP 
START in fact modern UNK opinion in the main has not UNK all the way back to the destructive UNK of the first half of the nineteenth century STOP 
START although one meets with occasional UNK like UNK or very recently arthur UNK the majority of scholars have taken a middle position between the UNK of UNK and UNK STOP 
START most now admit that UNK UNK UNK and the anglo-saxon UNK cannot be the UNK UNK to early english history that guest freeman and green thought them to be STOP 
START as UNK UNK has remarked the critical methods of the nineteenth century shattered most of this UNK narrative STOP 
START on the other hand the UNK of opinion is that used with caution and in conjunction with other types of evidence the native sources still provide a valid rough outline for the english settlement of southern britain STOP 
START as sir charles UNK once said it is no longer fashionable to UNK that we can say nothing certain about old english UNK STOP 
START therefore in one way UNK and UNK have been UNK STOP 
START their conclusions concerning the UNK of the west saxon UNK the confused UNK of UNK the UNK of the early positions of the anglo-saxon UNK and the mythological elements contained in UNK are now mostly accepted STOP 
START nevertheless in another way modern historians still labor in the UNK of the oxford school STOP 
START for it is their UNK concept of the anglo-saxon UNK rather than UNK UNK approach which UNK the field STOP 
START despite the rejection of the traditional accounts on many points of detail as late as 1948 it was still possible to UNK a massive and comparatively sudden beginning in UNK UNK UNK of germans as the type of UNK STOP 
START at this point of course the issue has become complicated by a development UNK by UNK and UNK STOP 
START they however much they were in disagreement with the late UNK over the method by which britain was UNK agreed with them that the end result was the complete UNK of the previous UNK population and civilization STOP 
START but beginning for all practical purposes with frederick UNK english village community scholars have had to UNK with a theory involving UNK and UNK continuity between roman and anglo-saxon times which is completely at odds with the UNK concept of the anglo-saxon UNK STOP 
START against UNK formidable UNK have taken the field notably f. w. UNK whose UNK book and beyond was written UNK for this purpose and sir paul UNK whose the growth of the UNK had a similar aim STOP 
START largely due to their efforts the UNK UNK has maintained its position although UNK has always found UNK STOP 
START UNK gray in his english field systems and UNK UNK UNK and UNK defended in part the UNK UNK while at the present time UNK UNK and UNK UNK seem to fall into the UNK UNK camp STOP 
START this is nevertheless a minority view STOP 
START most scholars while willing to accept a survival UNK of UNK art forms and a considerable proportion of the UNK population UNK any UNK UNK from UNK britain STOP 
START therefore it is plain that the clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us STOP 
START in the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars UNK UNK UNK UNK sir frank UNK et UNK who are in varying degrees UNK of the native traditions of the UNK but who defend the UNK type of invasion suggested by them STOP 
START they in effect have UNK the opposing positions of the nineteenth century STOP 
START on the other side are the UNK UNK who have taken a UNK UNK from both these schools of nineteenth century thought STOP 
START as a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual UNK UNK although the specialist nature of much of their work e.g. UNK gray and UNK tends to obscure their UNK STOP 
START those who do have occasion to deal with the UNK in a more general way like UNK shore and arthur UNK are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful UNK penetration into britain STOP 
START UNK in fact UNK that there were any anglo-saxon UNK at all other than a minor UNK UNK in UNK UNK STOP 
START now UNK for a moment some recent developments we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of UNK and UNK has UNK UNK UNK in this century STOP 
START it is no longer possible to say that a UNK attitude towards the received accounts of the UNK almost automatically produces a shore occupied by interpretation STOP 
START everyone is more or less UNK and virtually no one has been willing to accept UNK or UNK position on that point STOP 
START one reason is of course that the new UNK has been willing to maintain the general picture of the UNK as UNK in the traditional sources STOP 
START the few scholars who have adopted the shore occupied by interpretation UNK shore and UNK have all been UNK UNK STOP 
START moreover they have done so in rather special circumstances STOP 
START the primary reason for the UNK of the shore occupied by UNK has been the UNK and accumulation of UNK evidence the most striking feature of early english studies in this century STOP 
START again UNK recent developments UNK UNK UNK of 1913 has stood UNK so far as archaeology is concerned there is not the least warrant for the second shore occupied by of these theories STOP 
START even earlier UNK had come to the same conclusion STOP 
START what they meant was that there was no evidence to show that the south and east UNK of britain received UNK settlers UNK earlier than some other parts of england STOP 
START that is there was no trace of UNK in britain as early as the late third century to which time the UNK evidence for the UNK of the saxon shore UNK was beginning to point STOP 
START in the face of a clear judgment from archaeology therefore it became impossible for a time for scholars to UNK the shore settled by theory STOP 
START in recent years however a wind of change seems to be blowing through early english historical circles STOP 
START the great increase in the amount of UNK activity and therefore information in the years immediately UNK and following the second world war has brought to light data which has changed the UNK of the saxon shore dispute STOP 
START where there were none fifteen years ago several scholars currently are UNK their way UNK towards the acceptance of the shore occupied by position STOP 
START we must therefore have a look at the new UNK material and UNK the literary and UNK evidence which bears upon the problem STOP 
START what exactly are we trying to prove know that the saxon shore was a UNK of late roman defensive policy other words its existence belongs to the period of roman britain STOP 
START so whenever the UNK finally UNK from the island the saxon shore disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century STOP 
START we also know that the saxon shore as reflected in the UNK was created as a part of the UNK reorganization of britain post UNK UNK STOP 
START my argument is that there was no saxon shore prior to that time even though the UNK had been in existence since the time of UNK STOP 
START therefore what we must prove or UNK is that there were UNK in the broad sense in which we must UNK the word in the area of the saxon shore at the time it was called the saxon shore STOP 
START that is we must find UNK in east UNK kent UNK and hampshire in the last half of the fourth century STOP 
START the problem in other words is strictly a UNK one STOP 
START in UNK the saxon element on its saxon shore was plainly visible because there the UNK were an UNK element in the population STOP 
START in britain obviously the UNK and UNK characteristics of the saxon shore region are bound to be saxon STOP 
START it is a matter of trying to sort out an earlier UNK saxon element from the later UNK UNK of anglo-saxon UNK STOP 
START this naturally will be difficult to do since both the UNK and UNK evidence in this period with some fortunate exceptions is UNK for precise UNK purposes STOP 
START it might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer to one important question is the idea that there were saxon mercenaries in england at all reasonable STOP

START UNK gave renewed life to soap products at a time when UNK were a threat though expensive and these same UNK UNK the decline of soap usage when the UNK between UNK and synthetic detergent UNK was recognized and UNK STOP 
START the market today for detergent builders is quite diverse STOP 
START the best known field of application for builders is in UNK UNK detergent formulations for household use STOP 
START these widely UNK products which are used primarily for washing clothes are based on UNK synthetic organic UNK sodium UNK and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium UNK or a mixture of sodium UNK and UNK UNK STOP 
START in the household market there are also UNK detergent formulations based on UNK UNK with about the same amount of UNK builder synthetic UNK with much less builder the UNK UNK UNK as well as soap UNK and UNK none of which are now UNK UNK STOP 
START a UNK UNK which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent with which the major problem today is UNK of builder and active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder ratio STOP 
START UNK cleaning in household application is represented by two classes of UNK products 1 the formulations made UNK for machine UNK and 2 the UNK UNK used for walls and UNK STOP 
START the better quality products in both of these lines contain UNK builders STOP 
START in addition many of the UNK UNK used for walls and UNK had their UNK in UNK UNK which is still the major UNK of a number of such products STOP 
START many UNK UNK now also contain UNK STOP 
START these UNK UNK are discussed in chapter 28 STOP 
START the cleaning process cleaning or detergent action is entirely a matter of surfaces STOP 
START wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium a solid substrate soil to be removed and the detergent or UNK material STOP 
START an UNK UNK between UNK and UNK cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved STOP 
START one UNK of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of af STOP 
START in contrast a metal UNK af in size would have a magnitude from UNK to a million less STOP 
START even here there is room for some variation for metal surfaces vary in UNK UNK capacity and chemical reactivity STOP 
START spring used a brush UNK in a UNK study and showed considerable differences in soil removal depending upon surface UNK STOP 
START there are considerable differences between the requirements for textile and UNK cleaning STOP 
START exclusive of UNK values such as UNK or UNK level UNK content etc. the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles are high STOP 
START no matter how they are formulated a large number of organic UNK are simply not suitable for this application since they do not give adequate soil removal STOP 
START this is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation STOP 
START a good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many UNK with a poor formulation the clothes exhibit a UNK of UNK grey and dirty spots sometimes with bad results even after the first wash STOP 
START since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of UNK STOP 
START harris has indicated that two devices the UNK and UNK are most widely used for rapid detergent testing and he has listed the commercially available standard UNK fabrics STOP 
START also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general use STOP 
START the UNK fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by even the best detergent formulation in a single wash STOP 
START in this way numerical values for the relative UNK of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the UNK UNK of the cloth UNK before and after washing STOP 
START soil UNK is evaluated by washing clean UNK with the dirty ones STOP 
START as is the case with the UNK agent the requirements for builders to be used in detergent UNK for washing textiles are also high STOP 
START large numbers of potential builders have been investigated but none have been found to be as effective as the UNK over the relatively wide range of conditions met in practice STOP 
START the problems of UNK cleaning are not nearly as complex STOP 
START in UNK cleaning the inorganic UNK are more important than the organic active STOP 
START indeed when the proper inorganic UNK are employed practically any UNK or UNK agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a UNK cleaning formulation STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK are important inorganic UNK of UNK UNK STOP 
START in addition the UNK are also used probably acting more as UNK agents than anything else STOP 
START the importance of the inorganic UNK in UNK cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers STOP 
START physical chemistry of washing although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their UNK are not well understood at the present this section attempts to present briefly an UNK picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces STOP 
START the purpose of washing is obviously to remove soils which are UNK UNK in the four major categories given below 1 STOP 
START UNK which is here defined as UNK material which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely UNK divided so as to exhibit UNK properties STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START UNK soils which are UNK by UNK and fats UNK of UNK with UNK organic UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK which include the wide variety of UNK materials which give color even when present in very low concentration on the UNK object STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START UNK soils which primarily include UNK substances and UNK UNK which UNK to leave a UNK STOP 
START the dirt on the UNK objects is UNK held by surface UNK to some extent STOP 
START however a major factor in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under the name of van UNK UNK forces STOP 
START this is a UNK complicated UNK interaction which causes any extremely small UNK particle to UNK with other small UNK particles or to stick to an UNK surface STOP 
START obviously if UNK particles bear charges of opposite sign or if one kind is charged and the other kind is not the attraction will be UNK and the tendency to UNK will be greatly UNK STOP 
START likewise a charged particle will tend to stick to an UNK surface and vice UNK and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface UNK an opposite charge STOP 
START in addition dirt particles can be held onto a UNK surface by UNK substances or by the surface tension of UNK including liquid UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK soils are usually UNK onto the UNK surface STOP 
START in most cases these soils are taken up as UNK through UNK action STOP 
START in an essentially static system an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the UNK tensions of the water phase are reduced by a UNK agent STOP 
START the washing process whereby soils are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action to UNK the dirt particles and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to UNK off the UNK and acts to some extent as a UNK and UNK agent STOP 
START UNK soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water natural waters in addition often contain UNK such as calcium UNK which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove STOP 
START therefore UNK are used STOP 
START the detergent active is that substance which primarily acts to remove UNK soils STOP 
START the other UNK in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty UNK and the UNK UNK or dried soils STOP 
START as is well known detergent UNK belong to the chemical class consisting of UNK high molecular weight and highly UNK UNK which exhibit the property of forming UNK in solution STOP 
START UNK investigations of UNK UNK including the UNK have shown that there is little UNK or UNK of the chain UNK below a certain region of concentration called the critical UNK concentration STOP 
START 1 below the critical UNK concentration UNK and some UNK are present STOP 
START 2 in the critical UNK region there is a rapid UNK or UNK to give the UNK which have a degree of UNK UNK around 60 80 STOP 
START 3 for UNK these UNK appear to be roughly UNK UNK in which the UNK UNK come together so that the UNK groups the UNK ends face UNK towards the aqueous continuous phase STOP 
START obviously UNK UNK substances such as UNK oils or particles having a UNK or UNK surface are more at home in the center of a UNK than in the aqueous phase STOP 
START UNK can UNK and hold a considerable amount of UNK substances so that the UNK volume may be increased as much as approximately UNK STOP 
START although the matter has not been UNK demonstrated the available data show that UNK in themselves do not contribute significantly to the UNK process STOP 
START related to UNK formation is the UNK important ability of detergent UNK to UNK at oil water UNK in such a manner that the UNK or UNK end of the UNK is directed towards the aqueous phase and the UNK chain towards the UNK phase STOP 
START in the cleaning process UNK UNK soils become UNK in this manner with an oriented film of UNK STOP 
START then during washing the UNK soil rolls back at the edges so that UNK UNK can UNK themselves from the UNK oil mass with the aid of mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase STOP 
START obviously a substance which is permanently or temporarily UNK on the surface in place of the soil will tend to UNK this process and effectively push off the UNK soil STOP 
START substances other than detergent UNK also tend to be strongly UNK from aqueous media onto surfaces of other UNK UNK phases STOP 
START this is particularly true of highly charged UNK especially those UNK which fall into the class of UNK STOP 
START whereas the usual organic UNK agent is strongly UNK at oil water UNK the highly charged UNK are most strongly UNK at UNK between water and insoluble materials UNK an UNK structure see table UNK on p. UNK STOP 
START thus for aqueous media we can think of the UNK organic active as an UNK or UNK UNK agent and of an UNK builder as a UNK or UNK UNK agent STOP 
START from the equilibrium UNK data which are available it seems logical to expect that UNK UNK would be strongly UNK on the surface of the dirt especially clay soils so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge STOP 
START the charged particles then UNK each other and are also UNK from the charged surface which almost invariably bears a negative charge under washing conditions STOP 
START the UNK charged dirt particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase STOP 
START this hypothesis is UNK in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic UNK in UNK STOP 
START it does not consider the UNK effects of the UNK builders on UNK phenomena which will be discussed later see UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the crude picture of the UNK process thus far developed can be represented as af STOP 
START the influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may be compared to that of UNK energy on a molecular scale STOP 
START freed soil must be UNK and protected against UNK STOP 
START cleaned cloth must be protected against the UNK of UNK soil STOP 
START it is evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one detergent UNK acting alone are severe STOP 
START upon consideration of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing process it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent UNK having UNK properties has gained widespread acceptance STOP 
START in the over-all process it is difficult to assign a pure role to each UNK of a UNK formulation indeed there is no more reason to separate the UNK roles of the active builder UNK agent etc. than there is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous UNK making up a given commercial organic active STOP

START UNK sat over his second UNK in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on pennsylvania avenue STOP 
START UNK little cafe was small dark narrow and filled with the UNK UNK of beer tobacco smoke and italian cooking STOP 
START hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude al had accepted from a student at the UNK gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke STOP 
START the nude was small and UNK and UNK and was called UNK STOP 
START this was one place where UNK could go for a drink in a back UNK without anyone UNK him or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the UNK STOP 
START the other UNK were taxi drivers and art students and small UNK STOP 
START the reporters had not yet discovered that this was his UNK STOP 
START his friend jane was with him STOP 
START she was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did UNK too much and didn't own the UNK STOP 
START she was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash and UNK had found her a job as head of the historical section of the treasury STOP 
START this meant UNK out press UNK and the like STOP 
START jane sat UNK and interested STOP 
START UNK had a pleasant glow as he said you see both of them i mean the president and UNK lawrence are UNK STOP 
START a romantic is one who thinks the world is UNK inspired and all he has to do is find the right key and then divine justice and UNK will appear STOP 
START it's like UNK a camera distant ship isn't there until you get the focus STOP 
START you know what i'm talking about STOP 
START i'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them STOP 
START but when it comes to war the colonel knows what it is and UNK doesn't STOP 
START mr. UNK knows that a soldier will get the distinguished service UNK for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian STOP 
START he had a mean UNK sheer bastard in his outfit and someone invented the name UNK for him STOP 
START that's to say he was trigger happy STOP 
START he'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own UNK STOP 
START he was a UNK UNK silent country boy from the red clay of rural alabama and he spoke with the broad UNK that others normally make fun of STOP 
START but not in front of UNK STOP 
START i heard of some that tried it back in the states and he'd knock them clear across the room STOP 
START UNK been a pretty bad incident back at the marine base STOP 
START a new york kid a UNK from one of the harlem UNK made fun of UNK UNK and drew a knife STOP 
START before the fight was over the harlem boy had a UNK and UNK was cut up badly STOP 
START they caught UNK UNK liquor from the UNK mess and he got a couple of girls in trouble STOP 
START the fear of punishment just didn't bother him STOP 
START it wasn't there STOP 
START it was left out of him at birth STOP 
START this is why he made such a magnificent soldier STOP 
START he wasn't troubled with the ordinary UNK fear that UNK and UNK and UNK individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic STOP 
START it just didn't occur to UNK that anything serious would happen to him STOP 
START do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was nodded with a pleasant smile STOP 
START all right STOP 
START there was a UNK nest in a mountain UNK and it was picking off our men with UNK accuracy STOP 
START the colonel ordered that it be wiped out and i suggested you ask for volunteers and promise each man on the patrol a UNK of whisky ten dollars and a UNK pass to UNK STOP 
START UNK was one of the five volunteers STOP 
START the patrol UNK around in back of the UNK approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild UNK STOP 
START you could hear them from our UNK STOP 
START there was a lot of shooting STOP 
START we knew the enemy was UNK because a UNK was fired as the signal STOP 
START so we hurried over STOP 
START two of our men were killed a third was wounded STOP 
START UNK and a very black colored boy from detroit had killed or put out of action ten guerrillas by UNK and UNK fighting STOP 
START when we got there UNK and the negro were UNK over possession of a gold UNK around the neck of a wounded UNK STOP 
START the colored boy had it and UNK UNK at him with a knife and said give that to me you black bastard STOP 
START we don't UNK UNK to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where i come from STOP 
START the negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound STOP 
START what did the colonel do about the men asked in her UNK interested way STOP 
START UNK laughed STOP 
START he recommended both of them for the UNK and the detroit fellow for the purple heart too for a UNK wound STOP 
START so you see mr. UNK knows what it's all about STOP 
START but not UNK lawrence STOP 
START when he was in the war he was in law or supplies or something like that and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on UNK to the pentagon and read the UNK for UNK just like the one we sent in for UNK and go away with a real glow STOP 
START these were heroes nine feet tall to him STOP 
START jefferson lawrence was alone at the small perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river STOP 
START he had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the UNK pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a UNK with two heads STOP 
START beside him was mrs. UNK STOP 
START he thought how this UNK UNK older woman UNK her way through the streets of westminster on a day in june enjoying the flowers in the shops the UNK from old friends but never really drawing a deep passionate breath was so like himself STOP 
START he and mrs. UNK too had never permitted themselves the luxury of UNK that dug into the bone UNK of the spirit STOP 
START he had not because he was both poor and ambitious STOP 
START poverty UNK a kind of UNK on the ambitious STOP 
START they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane STOP 
START no they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the ladder STOP 
START he made the decision with his eyes open or so he thought STOP 
START at any cost he must leave the UNK pennsylvania mining town where his father was a UNK STOP 
START and so he had so he had STOP 
START at state college he had no time to walk among the UNK on the UNK edge STOP 
START from his room he could look out in UNK and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly UNK across the campus and he could smell the sweet UNK winds STOP 
START he was not stone STOP 
START he was not UNK STOP 
START he had to teach himself UNK that these UNK were not for him STOP 
START he must mentally pull the UNK and close the window so that all that existed was in the books before him STOP 
START at law school the same STOP 
START more of this UNK down of human emotion as a young lawyer in new york STOP 
START by the time he was UNK enough his goals were high he was UNK and afraid of women STOP 
START the only one who would have him was his UNK the strange unhappy woman who became his wife STOP 
START perhaps it was right it was just STOP 
START he had dared to UNK nature to turn his back to the UNK and he was UNK STOP 
START like mrs. UNK with her UNK about peter UNK he had his moments of UNK over a youth too well spent STOP 
START if he had had a son he would tell him gather ye UNK while ye may this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying STOP 
START but then his son could afford it STOP 
START lawrence was waiting for bill UNK STOP 
START the vice president had called and asked if he could see the secretary at his home STOP 
START he said the matter was urgent STOP 
START the secretary was uneasy about the visit STOP 
START he did not like UNK STOP 
START he suspected something UNK and UNK about him STOP 
START lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely and this worried him STOP 
START when you disliked or UNK a man you should have a reason STOP 
START human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell STOP 
START lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic hoping that a clue to his dislike of the vice president would appear STOP 
START it did not STOP 
START therefore he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and UNK with his point of view STOP 
START a half hour later the vice president arrived STOP 
START he looked very carefully at every piece of UNK as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind STOP 
START he observed the UNK UNK in the hall the UNK painting in the library as well as the long UNK of UNK volumes pattern of the oriental rug the delicate UNK UNK STOP 
START he said to the secretary i understand you came from a little pennsylvania town near UNK STOP 
START how did you find out about this waved his arm around at the UNK STOP 
START it was not a UNK question lawrence decided STOP 
START this young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious had to find out STOP 
START the secretary did not tell him at what cost at what UNK he learned these things STOP 
START he merely said any good UNK these days can make you a UNK home STOP 
START the vice president said if you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they UNK the vice president's home let me know STOP 
START i can do business with that kind STOP 
START again lawrence thought a little sadly these were the fees of poverty and ambition STOP 
START UNK did not have the chance to grow up UNK STOP 
START he had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years STOP 
START they had UNK in the library STOP 
START UNK looked at lawrence with a searching glance the kind that a UNK attorney would give a man on trial STOP 
START what are your UNK will you break best to destroy your peace vice president said with a slight UNK there isn't anyone who loves the president more than i do STOP 
START old chris is my ideal STOP 
START at the same time you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the marine corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics STOP 
START what does a monk know about sex listened with the UNK UNK calm of the lawyer but his face was in the shadow STOP 
START so we have to protect the old man for his own good STOP 
START you see what i mean STOP 
START congress is full of politicians and if you want to get along with them you have to be UNK STOP 
START this is why i say we just can't go ahead and UNK the germans and pull down our own defenses STOP 
START let me tell you what happened to me today STOP 
START a fellow came up to me a senator i don't have to tell you his name and he told me i love the president like a brother but god damn it he's UNK me STOP 
START i've got a quarter of a million germans in my state and those UNK UNK in on father UNK every night and if he tells them to go out and UNK in the public square that's what they do STOP 
START he's telling them now to write letters to their UNK opposing the disarmament of germany STOP 
START and another one comes to me and he says look here there's a mill in my state UNK five thousand people making uniforms for the navy STOP

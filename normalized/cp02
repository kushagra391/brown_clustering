START people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it STOP 
START the room filled with smoke and UNK head UNK with excitement and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to UNK it STOP 
START little anne rapidly UNK her mother in recovery STOP 
START in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a UNK of UNK hair all over her head STOP 
START she stopped flying into UNK and started UNK her food developed a UNK and cream UNK and a sunny disposition and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her STOP 
START she was so heavy that UNK arms shook from UNK her and taking care of her STOP 
START maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do there was the big basket of clothes to be UNK through the UNK old UNK and UNK out and UNK back was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating STOP 
START worry had a great deal to do with it had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office taking what salary his father could hand out to him STOP 
START mr. UNK would have preferred death and UNK to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his UNK UNK and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby milk and orange juice and UNK and soap just plain soap STOP 
START maggie and stuart UNK over figures every night trying to find how they could squeeze out a few UNK more STOP 
START in UNK maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things it seems to me you have enough to do as it is eugenia said STOP 
START she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again STOP 
START i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something maggie said STOP 
START it would make me feel a lot better but the woman's exchange isn't taking UNK goods any more and i can't leave the baby with grandma because she isn't strong enough and the UNK too young to be put in a nursery STOP 
START i should think so eugenia said STOP 
START for one thing you can stop keeping that child in UNK UNK and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day STOP 
START she's so beautiful and i do like to keep her looking nice STOP 
START maggie said STOP 
START she picked up the baby and UNK her fat warm little neck STOP 
START UNK be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be UNK eugenia said STOP 
START UNK mae UNK said she didn't put a thing on her child but a UNK UNK until it was nine months old STOP 
START UNK mae UNK got all her baby clothes from UNK UNK UNK in new york and i'm sick and tired of hearing about UNK mae UNK STOP 
START well now maggie you don't have to snap at me eugenia said STOP 
START i'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible STOP 
START i'm sorry STOP 
START i do seem to snap at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money STOP 
START well let's see STOP 
START let's make a list of your assets STOP 
START maggie started laughing and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop and she kept on laughing while she UNK the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining STOP 
START when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope UNK down words and figures STOP 
START i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers eugenia said STOP 
START we could put up UNK on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a UNK where it's nice and sunny but of course it would UNK quite a bit of running up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that STOP 
START what else you might set up a dress shop in the living room STOP 
START every woman in the block has tried that STOP 
START what about a tea room then could set up tables in the front room and serve UNK and your UNK UNK and brown bread and grandma could dress like a UNK and tell UNK STOP 
START it's too elaborate STOP 
START and grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i STOP 
START eugenia sighed STOP 
START she said well those are the really interesting things but if you don't like any of those i can turn over some of my extra UNK jobs to you if you think you can type well enough STOP 
START oh i'm sure i could do that maggie said STOP 
START but it really wouldn't be fair taking your jobs away from you STOP 
START don't worry i can get plenty more eugenia said wondering where in the world she could STOP 
START maggie was looking much happier already clearing a space on the table and UNK about how she could put up a UNK right there and be UNK up on her UNK so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it STOP 
START and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time STOP 
START and i can go back to my UNK and be thinking while i'm doing the washing STOP 
START what are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything laughed STOP 
START she said oh eugenia i wish what i wish i had three wishes maggie said STOP 
START all of them for you STOP 
START it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november contributing to the UNK of countless numbers of people STOP 
START the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days STOP 
START the cold settled like a tangible UNK over the mile high city locking it in an icy grip that UNK its UNK and altered its physical appearance had a look of grim UNK realism UNK other cities whose UNK climate was cold instead of the UNK UNK UNK UNK western city UNK in eternal UNK at the foot of mountains stored with endless UNK and resources STOP 
START the UNK UNK in the streets outside of employment offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines outside government agencies STOP 
START there weren't facilities to take care of them never had been a need felt for such facilities STOP 
START that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east which created UNK with their stock markets and their UNK UNK and their UNK UNK of industries protected by UNK freight rates STOP 
START the east was UNK supposed to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west along now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay STOP 
START the government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold UNK everything STOP 
START shivering people talked and argued this government spending would have to be paid for somehow but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate UNK and something had to be done STOP 
START something had to be done was the theme song of millions of american people their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government STOP 
START something had to be done STOP 
START the UNK said it to each other a dozen times a day STOP 
START something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half UNK for UNK for clothes for the new UNK in the roof for gas and light bills keeping warm about keeping well about meeting the minor UNK that came up once twice fifty times a day STOP 
START just dropping the UNK bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster STOP 
START the UNK furnace consumed fuel like a giant UNK UNK that had to be UNK by UNK tons of coal into its evil red depths and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold STOP 
START cold came in the UNK UNK that seemed to have UNK up under doors around UNK window frames from the sleeping UNK the attic from the UNK UNK between UNK on the roof STOP 
START presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed and the UNK and an electric heater in UNK room STOP 
START it was so cold and so UNK that a sort of desperate UNK UNK all of them like people UNK or UNK or caught in some other UNK of circumstance so that time stood still and minor UNK fell away and the only important thing was to UNK together and survive STOP 
START the UNK burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their UNK while they UNK the UNK STOP 
START they lived mainly in the kitchen moved UNK bed and the UNK basket there and the rest of them UNK by the stove and ran UNK and shivering to the upper UNK regions and plunged into icy beds STOP 
START grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days and it was the way people ought to live only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to STOP 
START you said a UNK eugenia said grimly STOP 
START eugenia hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to find the UNK of poverty wearing thin STOP 
START she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to UNK in it and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever STOP 
START plenty of people are poor all their lives STOP 
START plenty of people haven't our brains and talent STOP 
START i know you when you start talking about brains and talent maggie said STOP 
START you're working up to something and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the UNK family is superior to everything even a depression STOP 
START the only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it eugenia said STOP 
START they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord UNK it to be of UNK than it would have to be that way STOP 
START she didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater STOP 
START hope wouldn't hear of it and she took the heater back to UNK room and grandma took it back to UNK room and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma UNK it over and almost set her UNK on fire STOP 
START she said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room and she could be burned to a UNK without anybody knowing it STOP 
START eugenia suspected her of deliberately UNK the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in STOP

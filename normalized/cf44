START in general religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the UNK membership however is another thing STOP 
START a congregation UNK only if it can sustain a socially UNK membership is when it can preserve economic integration STOP 
START religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation since the decision to join a UNK group requires some motive force but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition STOP 
START the breakdown of social UNK in inner city areas and the spread of inner city UNK account for the decline of central city churches STOP 
START central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations 1 central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes 2 central cities tend to be more UNK in social composition STOP 
START the central city areas in other words exhibit the two characteristics which UNK the life principle of congregations of the major denominations they have too few middle-class people mix middle-class people with UNK residents STOP 
START central city areas have become UNK UNK UNK for the major denominations since the UNK of middle-class people from most central cities STOP 
START with few exceptions the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city STOP 
START the key to protestant development therefore is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation STOP 
START members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes this is UNK for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic UNK STOP 
START the congregation UNK when it is no longer possible to UNK that core from the neighborhood residential UNK is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to UNK constantly in their core UNK in order to survive can lose UNK and UNK members from the church without UNK but they need adequate UNK for the core UNK in order to preserve economic integration STOP 
START the congregation is first and foremost an economic UNK group is UNK a believing and UNK fellowship STOP 
START if it were primarily a believing fellowship it would UNK UNK from all social and economic ranks something which most congregations of the new protestantism with a few notable exceptions have not been able to do STOP 
START they survive only when they can UNK social and economic UNK STOP 
START the UNK of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the UNK spirit of protestant religious life fact a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the impersonal roman catholic parish STOP 
START we have seen that the UNK spirit is confined to economic UNK the UNK to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations as we shall see in another connection STOP 
START the UNK of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must UNK therefore to the principle of economic integration STOP 
START this fact is evident in the UNK of new members STOP 
START mission as UNK the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary UNK of the major denominations STOP 
START there is much talk in theological circles about the church as mission and the UNK mission have been UNK the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the UNK of the world STOP 
START a crucial question therefore is what UNK and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism STOP 
START if economic integration really shapes congregational life then UNK should be a process of extending economic integration STOP 
START the task of a congregation would be defined according to economic integration as the work of UNK individuals and families of similar social and economic position to UNK the nuclear core of the congregation STOP 
START UNK means to choose by joint action in order to fill a UNK can also mean the UNK of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization STOP 
START in a mobile society congregational health depends on a constant process of UNK UNK however must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will UNK the congregation the UNK or missionary UNK of the congregation will be UNK rather than proclamation like elements will have to be UNK STOP 
START UNK and congregational UNK have not been carefully studied in the churches study in pittsburgh however has illuminated the situation STOP 
START in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches almost 60 per cent were UNK by initial contacts with friendly members STOP 
START if we add to these contacts with friendly members the contacts with an organization of the church UNK per cent of the cases then a substantial two UNK of all UNK is through friendly contact STOP 
START on the surface this seems a sound approach to christian mission members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people new people respond in kind by joining the church STOP 
START missionary UNK by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations STOP 
START this means that the UNK of the congregation are extended into the community picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation mission of the church is actually a process of informal UNK lay ministry is a means to UNK UNK people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation STOP 
START churches can be UNK through this process of UNK so long as the UNK of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration the pool of UNK UNK the congregation is helpless friendly contacts no longer keep it going STOP 
START the UNK of mission to UNK is further indicated by the UNK of educational activities worship preaching and publicity in reaching new members STOP 
START the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to UNK contacts by the clergy UNK per cent of new members and friendly contacts by members over two UNK if UNK activities are included STOP 
START publicity UNK for UNK per cent of the initial contacts with new members STOP 
START in general friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a UNK will account for a major share of UNK by the churches making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through UNK is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church integration and UNK are the two methods by which protestants associate with and UNK from the neighborhood STOP 
START the inner life of congregations will UNK so long as UNK people of similar social and economic level can UNK together outer life of congregations the UNK of the environment to their survival will be UNK so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership STOP 
START economic integration UNK when the social and economic UNK in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation STOP 
START in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly since such nice UNK of economic integration are hard to sustain in the UNK for more than a single generation STOP 
START the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance STOP 
START the expense of this type of organization in religious life when one recalls the number of city churches which UNK beyond repair before being abandoned raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society the UNK of economic integration in congregations UNK the nature of the protestant development STOP 
START it was observed in the UNK chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends expanding UNK on an impersonal basis and growing UNK in local UNK UNK STOP 
START these trends seem to be working at UNK in the UNK STOP 
START residential associations struggle to UNK themselves against UNK STOP 
START the UNK of impersonal UNK and UNK of residential communities have UNK UNK between central city and suburb negro and white blue collar and white collar can be viewed as UNK of this deeper UNK of trends in the UNK STOP 
START it now becomes evident that the UNK church is UNK involved with the economy of middle-class culture for it serves to UNK the social class identity of middle-class residential UNK STOP 
START the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has UNK the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations STOP 
START this conformity represents a desperate attempt to UNK a UNK UNK environment STOP 
START more than creatures of metropolitan forces the churches have taken the lead in UNK the UNK of metropolitan life UNK and UNK the UNK of peoples giving form to the struggle for social UNK in a world of UNK peoples STOP 
START since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life the UNK forces of residential and religious UNK have fought a desperate UNK action against the expanding UNK of the UNK STOP 
START consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests STOP 
START negroes puerto UNK and rural UNK are slowly making their way into the cities STOP 
START soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs and the churches will experience the same decay and UNK cycle which has characterized their history for a century STOP 
START the identification of the basic unit of religious organization the parish or congregation with a residential area is UNK in a modern UNK for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the UNK of the christian fellowship and the UNK of mission to UNK STOP 
START mission to the UNK UNK survival of the congregation in the residential community because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan UNK with residential UNK STOP 
START this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various UNK for the churches STOP 
START it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is UNK to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes STOP 
START it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity since worship UNK some local UNK STOP 
START whatever UNK one makes the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people STOP 
START attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the UNK churches style is UNK an expression of the UNK style of the middle classes STOP 
START the UNK of this style are UNK and emphasis on achievements in gaining UNK STOP 
START these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman UNK the methods of child UNK determining the pattern of community participation setting the style for the UNK treatment of middle-class illness and UNK the congregational life of the major denominations STOP 
START fellowship by UNK and mission by friendly contact form the iron UNK of UNK religion STOP 
START its contents are another matter for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation STOP 
START what goes on in the UNK will occupy our attention under the UNK of the organization church STOP 
START an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to UNK the forces which have UNK the iron UNK of conformity which UNK the churches in their suburban UNK STOP 
START the UNK question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and UNK should fill the same need STOP

START the most surprising thing about the UNK congress of the soviet communist party is that it is surprising perhaps quite as much in its own way as the twentieth congress of 1956 which ended with that famous secret report on stalin STOP 
START the publication last july of the UNK draft program that UNK for the transition to communism had led the UNK to suppose that this UNK congress would be a sort of UNK of the khrushchev regime a solemn UNK of ideas which had in fact been current over the last three or four years i.e. since the defeat of the UNK group in all theoretical party UNK STOP 
START these never ceased to suggest that if in the eyes of UNK and UNK full communism was still a very distant ideal the establishment of a communist society had now under khrushchev become an immediate and tangible reality STOP 
START it seems that khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a UNK contribution to UNK doctrine with his draft program a large part of his UNK speech at the recent congress was in fact very largely a UNK of that UNK document STOP 
START he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the UNK by an all people's state and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater UNK of the whole UNK of soviets starting with the supreme soviet itself STOP 
START their plan for rotation of leaders promised a UNK blow at UNK and would enable the people to take a more direct and active part in running the country STOP 
START also elections would be more democratic might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from STOP 
START no doubt there was still a lot in the draft program and in khrushchev's speech which left many points obscure STOP 
START was it the UNK intention for example to UNK gradually the UNK system and replace it by UNK UNK UNK i.e. state farms which were moreover to be UNK UNK we know the soviet UNK today still very largely UNK on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot it is still very far from certain how valid the UNK claim is that in a growing number of UNK the peasants are finding it more profitable to surrender their private UNK to the UNK and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm STOP 
START if one follows the reports of the congress one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter STOP 
START the draft program was interesting in other respects too STOP 
START it contained for example a number of curious UNK about the peasants who enjoy no UNK benefits no UNK UNK no paid holidays still benefit far less than the other 50 per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the soviet union so greatly UNK itself on being STOP 
START over all these fairly awkward problems khrushchev was to UNK rather lightly though he repeated over and over again the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in UNK the ordinary people in russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism is really going to work in practice especially in respect of food STOP 
START would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry was something on which k. himself seemed to have some doubts he kept on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible for agricultural production STOP 
START and as we know the virgin lands are not producing as much as khrushchev had hoped STOP 
START one cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of khrushchev's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big UNK provided by this congress the UNK UNK on the crimes and UNK of the UNK group UNK UNK UNK and others including the UNK marshal UNK STOP 
START UNK in particular is being charged with all kinds of sins especially with wanting to cut down free public services to increase UNK and UNK fact with having been against all the more popular features of the khrushchev welfare state STOP 
START the trouble with all these UNK UNK is that we hear only one side of the story what in the secret UNK of the kremlin UNK had really proposed we just don't know and he has had no chance to reply STOP 
START but one cannot escape the suspicion that all this UNK UNK on the UNK of the long UNK UNK group would be totally unnecessary if there were not inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital UNK grounds on the actual methods to be employed in the transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy STOP 
START the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the UNK world is in the very center of this congress STOP 
START UNK declared UNK altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather the absence of war at a given moment and to a denial of the possibility of UNK a world war STOP 
START his views in fact coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence who look upon it merely as a UNK of the cold war or of an armed peace STOP 
START one cannot help wondering whether UNK and the rest of the UNK group are not being used as UNK UNK by khrushchev and his faithful followers STOP 
START for something clearly has gone very very seriously wrong in UNK relations which were never easy and have now UNK STOP 
START the effect of UNK UNK UNK with khrushchev together with the UNK attacks on UNK co. has shifted the whole attention of the world including that of the soviet people from the UNK UNK program to the present UNK conflict STOP 
START not only as we know did UNK UNK publicly treat khrushchev's attack on UNK as something that we cannot consider as a serious UNK approach to the problem i.e. as something thoroughly UNK and UNK but the UNK leaders went out of their way to be openly UNK to khrushchev calling him a UNK a UNK and so on STOP 
START it is extremely doubtful that the handful of UNK who call themselves communists could have done this without the direct approval of their chinese friends STOP 
START the big question is whether in the name of a restored UNK solidarity the chinese will choose to persuade the UNK to present their humble UNK to khrushchev or get rid of UNK UNK STOP 
START these seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy incident can now be closed STOP 
START but UNK is merely a UNK of a real UNK between china and russia STOP 
START there are other symptoms STOP 
START khrushchev for all his UNK UNK about the inevitable decay of capitalism is UNK favorable to peaceful coexistence and would like above all the berlin and german problems to be settled UNK knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the UNK honeymoon of 1959 STOP 
START but it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere in the first place from china but perhaps also from that china lobby which i was assured in moscow nearly two years ago exists on the quiet inside the party STOP 
START to these people solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia's future policy STOP 
START and the chinese as the UNK incident shows have strong UNK that khrushchev is anxious to secure a UNK peace with the west STOP 
START the fact that china which is UNK by UNK to khrushchev a very small matter should be supported by north korea and north UNK is highly UNK STOP 
START and one cannot but wonder whether marshal UNK who was blowing hot and cold UNK peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the west wasn't trying to keep the chinese quiet STOP 
START and this brings us inevitably to the UNK or UNK bomb STOP 
START was not this dropped primarily in order to UNK the chinese especially after khrushchev's UNK surrender to the west in UNK the german UNK UNK of december 31 does it all add up to are that khrushchev and with him the bulk of the soviet people favor peaceful coexistence and with the exception of berlin the maintenance of the status quo in the world STOP 
START the chinese north UNK and north UNK on the other hand feel that UNK russia is strong enough to support them in the just wars of UNK they would like to UNK on before long with china UNK UNK and the north UNK and north UNK UNK the southern half of their respective countries STOP 
START perhaps khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 when the UNK group nearly UNK him STOP 
START he seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition if he is up against UNK UNK spirit in world affairs he is going to be faced with the most UNK choice in his life STOP 
START he may support china but he won't may break with china which would be UNK difficult and perhaps disastrous or he may succeed by all kinds of dangerous UNK in UNK china to be patient STOP 
START the next days may show where things stand STOP 
START on a UNK sunday morning last month a small band of UNK UNK called the UNK held UNK in a UNK field about fifteen miles east of here STOP 
START eleven men a woman and a UNK boy UNK over cold damp UNK ground during a UNK field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare STOP 
START to the average american this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie STOP 
START but to the UNK this is a serious business STOP 
START they feel that the united states is engaged in a UNK struggle with communism for survival and world UNK STOP 
START they feel that world war 3 has already begun and they are setting themselves up as a last line of defense against the communist advance STOP 
START their national leader robert UNK UNK of UNK UNK says the UNK believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the red UNK STOP 
START in their UNK last month they wore world war 2 UNK UNK and UNK and carried UNK UNK rifles STOP 
START the UNK were held in secret after a regional UNK for the UNK held in nearby UNK ill. had been broken up the previous day by deputy UNK who had arrested regional leader richard UNK of UNK ill. and seized four UNK weapons including a UNK machine gun two UNK automatic rifles and an UNK rifle STOP 
START UNK by this UNK a small band of the faithful gathered at UNK home at UNK a.m. the next day put on their uniforms and headed for a farm several miles away STOP 
START a 60 UNK mortar and a UNK UNK UNK rifle owned by UNK were brought along STOP 
START the mortar was equipped with UNK shells and the UNK rifle was UNK STOP 
START after a UNK drive in an open truck and a world war 2 army jeep down UNK trails the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long low ridge and a UNK UNK STOP 
START here the two leaders UNK and UNK UNK to put the group through its UNK STOP 
START the UNK were instructed in the use of UNK for UNK STOP 
START they were shown how to advance against an enemy UNK UNK a cleared ridge STOP 
START they UNK movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke UNK they attempted a UNK line of advance against a UNK enemy UNK STOP 
START eleven UNK rounds were fired by UNK in a demonstration of UNK mortar shooting STOP 
START mrs. UNK the mother of five children and an active member of her husband's organization participated in all the exercises STOP 
START there were no UNK but the guerrillas admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called a UNK at 9 a.m. to enable UNK members to catch a plane STOP

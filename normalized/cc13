START a UNK in ancient india believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant UNK which in turn stood on the shell of a great UNK STOP 
START this theory eventually proved UNK STOP 
START but the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science STOP 
START it is the business of UNK the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic UNK by using keys that have UNK open other doors STOP 
START these keys are the working principles of physics mathematics and astronomy principles which are then UNK or projected to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge STOP 
START in the autumn of 1959 the british UNK corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in UNK STOP 
START three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a UNK STOP 
START the UNK were professor h. UNK professor of mathematics at king's college london w. b. UNK reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college london r. a. UNK a UNK at st. john's college cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge dr. g. j. UNK reader in applied mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology london STOP 
START dr. UNK UNK as UNK STOP 
START the programs were so well received by the british public that the arguments have been published in a totally UNK little book called rival theories of UNK STOP 
START dr. UNK begins with a discussion of the UNK theories of the universe based on the general theory of UNK STOP 
START first of all and this has been calculated by observation the universe is expanding that is the UNK are UNK from each other at immense speeds STOP 
START because of this dr. UNK holds that the universe is becoming more UNK populated by stars and whatever else is there STOP 
START this expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years STOP 
START UNK and contracts dr. UNK supports the idea that the universe both UNK and contracts that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in STOP 
START then after many more UNK of years when all the UNK are UNK toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again STOP 
START professor UNK UNK with the UNK theory STOP 
START he supports the UNK theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space STOP 
START for this reason he says the density of the universe always remains the same even though the UNK are UNK away in all directions STOP 
START new UNK are forever being formed to fill in the UNK left by the UNK UNK STOP 
START if this is true then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence even though the universe is expanding STOP 
START for new UNK to be created professor UNK declares it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years STOP 
START he UNK this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments STOP 
START dr. UNK backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of UNK and electrons STOP 
START UNK and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen the basic building block of matter STOP 
START the charges of the electron and UNK are believed to be exactly equal and opposite but dr. UNK is not so sure STOP 
START suppose says dr. UNK the UNK has a slightly greater charge than the electron so slight it is presently UNK STOP 
START this would give the hydrogen atom a slight UNK STOP 
START now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms it would be subject both to the UNK of the sphere and the UNK of all those atoms in the sphere STOP 
START because electrical forces the UNK are far more powerful than UNK the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere STOP 
START dr. UNK then UNK the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it STOP 
START this he claims would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe STOP 
START UNK glimpse this slim book while giving the reader only a UNK glimpse of the scientific mind UNK the universe has the appeal that informed conversation always has STOP 
START several photographs and UNK of UNK help the UNK keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicates the UNK were determined to avoid the UNK that seems to work its way into almost every field STOP 
START it is clear from this discussion that UNK of every UNK look UNK toward the day when a UNK UNK can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new UNK to science STOP 
START presently the intense absorption of UNK UNK in the earth's atmosphere seriously UNK ground observation STOP 
START these scientists are convinced that a UNK UNK by the earth's UNK will go a long way toward UNK or destroying cosmic theories STOP 
START there would seem to be some small UNK in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time UNK the study of the space around us giving us a UNK ladder from which to UNK at alien regions STOP 
START in doing away with the tea tray the UNK and the giant UNK science has developed a series of UNK UNK explanations of the UNK STOP 
START and although the universe may forever UNK understanding it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man STOP 
START roots the new play at the UNK UNK theater on UNK st. which has been made over from a night club is about the intellectual and spiritual UNK of an english farm girl STOP 
START highly successful in england before its transfer to new york most of roots is as UNK UNK as the UNK of the small new theater are UNK STOP 
START only in its final scene where UNK UNK mary UNK UNK off the disappointment of being UNK by her intellectual lover and UNK her emancipation do we get much which makes UNK the series of UNK UNK UNK we have had to watch for most of the first two and UNK acts STOP 
START the burden of mr. UNK message is that people living close to the soil at least in england are not the happy fine strong natural UNK people UNK intellectuals imagine STOP 
START rather they are genuine UNK proud of their UNK and openly UNK to the UNK influences of UNK or thought STOP 
START they care no more for politics says mr. UNK than they do for a symphony STOP 
START seeming to have roots in the soil they actually have none in life STOP 
START they UNK in short in the UNK UNK in which peasants and UNK of the past are commonly reported to have lived STOP 
START but this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as mr. UNK UNK to it STOP 
START so much UNK of mind and household does not attract the interest of the UNK unless he has been living in a UNK palace perhaps and wants a real big heap of contrast STOP 
START the UNK meals the washing of dishes the drying of clothes may be realism but there is such a thing as UNK STOP 
START now for the good points STOP 
START miss UNK as UNK has a great fund of animal spirits a strong voice and a warm smile STOP 
START she is just home from a UNK in london where she has become the UNK of a young fellow named UNK we never do see him and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and UNK including a dose of good british socialism STOP 
START but while she is able to tell her UNK family about the new world she has seen open before her UNK has not been able to observe her progress and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull he UNK UNK a letter of UNK STOP 
START UNK getting no sympathy for her UNK soon UNK and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom STOP 
START despite a too long sustained UNK flight this final speech is convincing and we see why british audiences apparently were impressed by roots STOP 
START there were several fairly good minor UNK in the play including william UNK UNK of a stubborn rather UNK father and UNK UNK vigorous UNK of a farm mother who UNK no UNK nonsense from her daughter or anyone else STOP 
START but i am afraid mr. UNK meat and potatoes dish isn't well UNK enough for local audiences STOP 
START shakespeare had a word for everything even for the rain that UNK wednesday night's much UNK about nothing opening the season of free theatre in central park STOP 
START the new york shakespeare festival which is using the UNK memorial UNK UNK while its theatre near the UNK is being completed began UNK STOP 
START joseph UNK UNK UNK of the festival and director of much UNK had a UNK colorful production under way STOP 
START using a wide stage UNK he UNK music and dance with UNK words in a UNK mixture STOP 
START the audience filled all the seats inside the UNK UNK and UNK onto the UNK outside the fence STOP 
START the barbed UNK of UNK and UNK so contemporary to a public UNK to the humor of UNK raised UNK STOP 
START the UNK comedy of UNK and UNK also familiar in a day that UNK easily to UNK UNK off the top of UNK heads UNK laughter STOP 
START the UNK of the UNK party at UNK palace with the spanish UNK in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting prince of UNK cast a spell of delight STOP 
START as much UNK turned serious while the UNK UNK rejected hero at the UNK a UNK began to fall STOP 
START at first hardly a person in the audience moved although some UNK were opened STOP 
START but the rain came more heavily and men and women in light summer clothes began to UNK STOP 
START the UNK hero and her father UNK followed by the UNK left the stage STOP 
START a voice on the UNK system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes STOP 
START more than half the audience UNK STOP 
START some remained in the UNK UNK UNK with UNK or with newspapers to cover their heads STOP 
START others UNK under the trees outside the fence STOP 
START twenty minutes after the UNK although it was still UNK the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped STOP 
START UNK UNK martin and UNK j. d. UNK took their places on the stage STOP 
START in their very first speeches it was clear that shakespeare like a UNK had UNK this moment STOP 
START said UNK lady UNK have you UNK all this while UNK UNK and i will weep a while longer STOP 
START the UNK refused to give up their UNK STOP 
START the UNK company completed act 4 and got through part of act 5 STOP 
START but the final scenes could not be played STOP 
START if any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the UNK are in doubt about how it comes out let them take comfort STOP 
START much UNK ends happily STOP 
START the parks department has done an UNK job of preparing the UNK UNK for shakespeare STOP 
START one could hardly blame UNK morris the parks commissioner for UNK so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising UNK its UNK its generous wings and even its impressive UNK for the use of the UNK STOP 
START UNK elder who designed the stage also created a gay UNK set that UNK UNK with the park background and UNK UNK mood STOP 
START mr. UNK has directed a performance that has UNK and pace although he has UNK obvious business to UNK easy UNK where UNK and consistency of style would be UNK STOP

START UNK handed the pass to the colonel STOP 
START he had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and UNK thrust into the UNK belt STOP 
START despite his UNK the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines STOP 
START he would remain in the tent waiting UNK occupied by some trivial task STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START sir UNK me the copies of everything b and c companies have UNK in the last six months STOP 
START the last six months sir you heard me STOP 
START there's a lot of waste going on here STOP 
START it's got to stop STOP 
START i want to take a look STOP 
START this is no damned holiday UNK STOP 
START get busy STOP 
START yes sir STOP 
START UNK left the tent STOP 
START below he could see the bright UNK lighting the UNK STOP 
START he glanced back STOP 
START the colonel crouched UNK on one of the UNK chairs UNK UNK at his UNK STOP 
START the UNK was a UNK structure of heavy UNK covered with earth STOP 
START it stood some fifty UNK from the edge of the bank STOP 
START from the outside it seemed no more than a low UNK a UNK on the dark earth STOP 
START a crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor STOP 
START two UNK enabled observers to watch across the river STOP 
START the place smelled strongly of rank UNK earth UNK wood and UNK STOP 
START the UNK floor was UNK beneath UNK boots STOP 
START at least the union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle STOP 
START there was no place to sit but watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window UNK and back UNK slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams STOP 
START in the corner was the soldier with the white flag STOP 
START he stood UNK erect UNK the staff his body half hidden by the limp cloth STOP 
START watson hardly looked at him STOP 
START the man had come UNK aboard the UNK UNK at the last instant UNK the flag of UNK STOP 
START someone had UNK him over the side and he had remained silent while they crossed STOP 
START an officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank STOP 
START the men in the boats had started UNK happily at first sight of the officer two of them calling him billy STOP 
START when the boat had touched the UNK ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers STOP 
START watson had presented his UNK and been led to the UNK STOP 
START the officer had told him that both lists must be checked STOP 
START watson had given his name and asked for a UNK pass STOP 
START the officer surprised said he would have to see STOP 
START watson had nodded UNK and muttered that he would check the lists himself later STOP 
START he had peered through the darkness at the UNK STOP 
START the men he would take back across the river stood there but he turned away from them STOP 
START he wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and UNK that other men felt STOP 
START he had hoped to be alone in the UNK but the soldier had followed him STOP 
START though watson carefully ignored the man he could not deny his presence STOP 
START perhaps it would be better to speak to him since silence could not UNK his form STOP 
START watson glanced briefly at him seeing only a body UNK erect behind the UNK UNK STOP 
START we won't be too long STOP 
START if my pass is approved i may be a half hour STOP 
START the soldier answered in a curious muffled voice his lips barely moving STOP 
START watson turned away and did not see the man's knees UNK and his body UNK STOP 
START yes sir STOP 
START he had acknowledged the man STOP 
START it was easier to think now watson decided STOP 
START the stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts STOP 
START he paced slowly UNK staring at the damp UNK floor STOP 
START he tried to order the words of the three union officers seeking to create some UNK portrait of the dead boy STOP 
START but he UNK UNK STOP 
START his lack of success steadily UNK his interest STOP 
START he stopped UNK leaned against the UNK UNK wall and let his mind drift STOP 
START a feeling of UNK an UNK of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known UNK through him STOP 
START what in the name of god was he doing crouched in a UNK pit on the wrong bank of the river had he crossed the dark water to bring back a group of UNK soldiers or to UNK in a UNK hole grew UNK and at the same time surprised at that emotion STOP 
START he was conscious of a growing sense of UNK STOP 
START UNK had written it all out hadn't he the report official enough did he hope to accomplish here had ordered him not to leave the far bank STOP 
START UNK by a guilty urge he had UNK the order of a man he respected STOP 
START for what tell john something he would find out for himself STOP 
START the figure in the corner UNK loudly a deep liquid UNK STOP 
START watson UNK and then laughed aloud STOP 
START exactly UNK voice was muffled again UNK with UNK STOP 
START he UNK the staff and his dark eyes UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK me sir STOP 
START let's get out of here STOP 
START watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second UNK in the cool air that smelled of mud and river UNK STOP 
START to his left the two UNK UNK their sharp UNK into the soft bank STOP 
START the UNK boat swung slowly to the pull of the current STOP 
START a soldier held the end of a UNK rope STOP 
START three union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready STOP 
START watson stared at them curiously STOP 
START they were UNK men well fed and UNK with neat uniforms and sturdy boots STOP 
START behind them UNK a long column of weak UNK men STOP 
START the thin gray figures raised a UNK UNK cry like the call of a bird UNK STOP 
START they moved toward the UNK with UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START four men were knocked down but did not attempt to rise STOP 
START they crept down the UNK slope toward the waiting boats STOP 
START the union soldiers UNK arms and settled into healthy indifferent UNK to watch the UNK UNK of the UNK STOP 
START the UNK men tried to rise and fell again STOP 
START no one moved to them STOP 
START watson watched two of them UNK into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg UNK STOP 
START in a confused UNK and UNK shift of bodies and UNK arms the two men were dragged into the same UNK STOP 
START the third UNK man forced himself erect STOP 
START he UNK like a UNK his arms milling in slow circles STOP 
START he paced forward UNK leaning too far back his head tilted UNK STOP 
START his steps were short and stiff and with his head thrown back his progress was a UNK UNK STOP 
START he appeared to be UNK UNK down his nose at the crowded and UNK vessel that would carry him to freedom STOP 
START he UNK into the water and fell heavily over the side of the UNK UNK his weight nearly UNK the craft STOP 
START watson looked for the fourth man STOP 
START he had reached the three passive guards crept in an UNK manner UNK the ground before him STOP 
START the guards did not look at him STOP 
START the figure on the earth halted seemingly UNK STOP 
START he sank back on his thin UNK like a weary UNK STOP 
START then he began to crawl again STOP 
START watson watched the UNK figure STOP 
START he felt a UNK interest STOP 
START would the man make it or not only there was a clock for him to crawl against STOP 
START if he failed to reach the UNK in five minutes say then the UNK would pull away and leave him UNK in the mud STOP 
START say three minutes to make it UNK STOP 
START still the guards did not move but stood UNK UNK from the UNK man STOP 
START the figure halted and watson UNK STOP 
START the man began to UNK in the wrong direction UNK by a slight rise in the ground turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the UNK STOP 
START watson raced for him his boots UNK the soft earth STOP 
START the guards came to life with UNK UNK STOP 
START they spun and flung their rifles up STOP 
START watson UNK wildly STOP 
START one man dropped to his knee for better aim STOP 
START let me help him for the love of god guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at watson with UNK puzzled faces STOP 
START watson UNK to the UNK man and stopped UNK heavily STOP 
START he reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm STOP 
START beneath his UNK a flat strip of muscle UNK on the bone STOP 
START watson bent UNK and lifted the man to his feet STOP 
START watson stared into a UNK face STOP 
START two UNK balls the color of UNK rolled between UNK UNK STOP 
START light sticks of fingers the tips UNK with dark earth UNK at UNK throat STOP 
START the man's voice was a sweet patient whisper STOP 
START henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right there STOP 
START but you ain't henry STOP 
START no STOP 
START it don't matter STOP 
START is it far far could it be watson thought UNK how far can a blind man crawl body length or all the rest of his UNK life not far STOP 
START you talk deep STOP 
START not like us UNK STOP 
START it raises the voice UNK in camp STOP 
START you UNK yes STOP 
START come on now STOP 
START can you walk why course i can STOP 
START i can walk real good STOP 
START watson stumbled down the bank STOP 
START the man leaned his UNK body against UNK shoulder STOP 
START he was no heavier than a child STOP 
START watson paused for breath STOP 
START the man UNK UNK his UNK breath beating softly against UNK neck STOP 
START his sweet whisper came after great effort STOP 
START oh christ STOP 
START i wish you was henry STOP 
START he promised to take me STOP 
START UNK STOP 
START we're almost there STOP 
START watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the UNK figure over the bow of the nearest UNK STOP 
START the man UNK on a UNK turning his ruined eyes from side to side STOP 
START watson turned away UNK for the first time in many months STOP 
START he heard the patient voice calling STOP 
START henry are you henry make him lie down snatched a deep breath STOP 
START he had not meant to UNK STOP 
START he stood with his back to the UNK STOP 
START the men UNK and UNK UNK to be taken away STOP 
START watson spoke UNK to the dark night UNK with UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK you do you do to them UNK at him UNK STOP 
START he was angry UNK STOP 
START he had not felt that during the afternoon STOP 
START no nor later STOP 
START all his emotions had been UNK UNK STOP 
START in war on a night like this it was only the UNK emotions that UNK what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others STOP 
START yes STOP 
START that was it STOP 
START he was sure of it STOP 
START john's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen STOP 
START what a fool he had been to think of his brother charles was dead STOP 
START what did it matter name had been crossed off a list STOP 
START already his cool body lay in the ground STOP 
START what words had any meaning had he thought of to go to john UNK and beg understanding confess with a canvas chair as a UNK UNK at his heart until a rough and stupid hand UNK him rise and go were UNK every day tumbled into UNK like so many torn UNK flung down a portable UNK STOP

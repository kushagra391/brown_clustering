START for several months now jack UNK a big UNK boy of fifteen with a UNK UNK face and UNK UNK eyes with a lot of red in them had been UNK by a dream a vision of a woman STOP 
START this woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she UNK warmth a sweet warmth would talk to him in a UNK voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him UNK STOP 
START when she would do these things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach STOP 
START then he would run to the toilet behind the house STOP 
START sometimes he did this three or four times a day for this woman was almost always with him STOP 
START he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him STOP 
START but they never said anything so he figured it was all right STOP 
START and so when miss langford came to teach at the UNK UNK school where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the woman of jack's mind assumed the UNK face and figure STOP 
START he could not keep his eyes off her when at school he went home at night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do STOP 
START when he UNK in the UNK she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh STOP 
START miss langford her first name was UNK was an attractive girl STOP 
START tall blonde UNK fair UNK without being heavy she cut a fine figure of UNK UNK as she UNK among the pupils in her fresh UNK summer dress STOP 
START something was beginning to UNK and come alive in her too it may have been there for a good while since she was twenty now if it had been it had been UNK until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like jack STOP 
START she would look at jack with that hidden something in her eyes and jack would see the woman and become UNK and a little sick STOP 
START school began in august the UNK part of the year and for the first few days miss langford was very UNK with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another STOP 
START the first two or three days they went home early STOP 
START all that is except jack STOP 
START he hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened UNK and put the room in order STOP 
START once this was on the third day of school she UNK down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress at the bare UNK of UNK white leg STOP 
START he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating STOP 
START about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although probably she didn't even see him STOP 
START he jumped back UNK and ran UNK down the hill away from the school STOP 
START he didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath he slowed to a walk STOP 
START the vision became even stronger now STOP 
START i'll get her yet he muttered to himself STOP 
START i've got to get her STOP 
START that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he had never engaged in the act in reality and when he UNK the next morning his heart was UNK STOP 
START he ate UNK that morning and his mother became concerned UNK as he usually ate UNK STOP 
START what's the matter honey said with the UNK of a UNK woman for her only child STOP 
START aren't you hungry no i'm not hungry he said pushing back the UNK and eggs STOP 
START outside it was already hot at UNK a.m. and it was getting hot in the kitchen STOP 
START he felt a little sick at his stomach STOP 
START are you sick no he said STOP 
START i'll be all right STOP 
START i guess it's this hot weather STOP 
START don't you play hard today then STOP 
START and if you get sick ask the teacher to let you come home early STOP 
START UNK left the car for me and i'm going to town this afternoon STOP 
START UNK i won't play hard he promised STOP 
START just then charles lever yelled hey jack from the UNK road which ran behind the UNK house and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and UNK out the kitchen door UNK UNK UNK over his shoulder STOP 
START UNK say boy said UNK showing his huge yellow teeth STOP 
START charles also fifteen was tall and UNK UNK with straight black hair like an UNK and sharp brown eyes STOP 
START he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him STOP 
START you know what i done last night said as they picked their way over the UNK road which led up the hill away from the UNK highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school STOP 
START jack knew of course that the tale to be UNK would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were UNK only apparent interest STOP 
START but jack always derived UNK UNK UNK from UNK UNK even when he suspected his friend of UNK or invention so he usually invited them as he did now STOP 
START no STOP 
START what i got UNK rider in one of them old box cars down there by the UNK STOP 
START a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind STOP 
START his heart beat faster STOP 
START hell you say said UNK into the UNK he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles STOP 
START UNK you do it hell i UNK got on top of no i mean UNK you get her to do it hell i UNK ask her STOP 
START UNK like that hell yes STOP 
START she's been UNK around me a lot here lately and i UNK i might as UNK try it STOP 
START besides i heard her old uncle that UNK there has been UNK it STOP 
START i never heard that STOP 
START it's all over UNK STOP 
START if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your UNK STOP 
START i might try it one of these days jack said UNK thinking of miss langford STOP 
START when they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse STOP 
START miss langford in a fresh white dress and UNK white UNK without UNK was out there with them trying to get them inside STOP 
START time for books she yelled UNK a little UNK store bell in her right hand STOP 
START let's go inside STOP 
START oh come on miss langford play with us just UNK one of the little girls begged smiling UNK STOP 
START no not now said the teacher STOP 
START maybe at dinner time STOP 
START come inside now STOP 
START the children UNK stopped playing then and UNK into the schoolhouse STOP 
START jack watched miss langford all morning STOP 
START he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles had said that morning about UNK rider STOP 
START occasionally he would look across the UNK at UNK fourteen and UNK in a fresh green UNK dress sitting in the UNK row and he could hardly believe she would do what charles had said she did STOP 
START at UNK remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys except charles went off out the road to play ball STOP 
START why ain't you UNK ball asked charles UNK as they sat in the UNK shade watching the girls UNK in front of the schoolhouse STOP 
START miss langford come out and play with us like you promised several of the little girls called STOP 
START i'd UNK stay here and watch the girls charles grinned STOP 
START maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress STOP 
START maybe jack said UNK watching for miss langford STOP 
START presently she came out of the schoolhouse STOP 
START when she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START let's play with 'em jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and UNK off his overall UNK STOP 
START UNK charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join the girls STOP 
START they played crack the whip a few minutes without UNK STOP 
START then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled UNK sitting down hard her dress flying over her head STOP 
START while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said UNK i'm sorry miss langford STOP 
START i didn't mean to pull so hard STOP 
START that's all right she said UNK her head back to get the hair out of her eyes STOP 
START it was my fault STOP 
START with one hand she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with the other STOP 
START when her hand touched his fire went through jack and he felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet STOP 
START he thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go STOP 
START thank you she said UNK herself off STOP 
START will you play with us again miss langford of the little girls said STOP 
START no more today STOP 
START maybe some other day STOP 
START oh UNK the girl said STOP 
START i don't believe i'll play any more neither STOP 
START me neither others said and soon the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups and alone STOP 
START jack walked off alone out the road in the UNK UNK sun past robert UNK UNK UNK house toward the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after school because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes STOP 
START when he came back to the schoolhouse his mind was made up STOP 
START he simply would not work his UNK problems when the teacher held his class STOP 
START that should do it he thought because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work STOP 
START he had considered throwing UNK or UNK UNK at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities the teacher probably would make him stand UNK in a corner instead of stay in after school STOP 
START the only UNK now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack STOP 
START but i've got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately STOP 
START to his surprise his plan worked perfectly STOP 
START all right if you can't do your UNK during school hours you can do it after school is out miss langford said firmly not smiling STOP 
START you will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems STOP 
START and so when the others UNK out that afternoon jack remained UNK in his seat near a window looking out in what he hoped was a UNK manner while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they UNK going home STOP 
START he scarcely saw them STOP 
START his heart was UNK like a mighty UNK and he was trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child how will i do it STOP

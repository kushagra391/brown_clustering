START the UNK of sociology have remained largely UNK by the UNK STOP 
START like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire UNK framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth STOP 
START but what is the operational worth of a sociology which UNK UNK the idea of physical models it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred UNK in social science has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by UNK mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological UNK STOP 
START this push to UNK the study of mass UNK to the measurements of UNK involved in differential UNK has led sociology UNK close to the reduction of the word mass to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied STOP 
START UNK UNK 1959 11 STOP 
START here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent STOP 
START the simple UNK success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned STOP 
START for if the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or UNK proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are valid STOP 
START the mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation STOP 
START UNK UNK 1959 12 STOP 
START a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between UNK UNK received and UNK logically formed STOP 
START philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially UNK categories STOP 
START this involves a UNK of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement STOP 
START UNK functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as UNK 1957 UNK and UNK 1959 UNK indicate that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models in which the notions of UNK i.e. metaphysical purpose are central STOP 
START UNK chapter 9 STOP 
START UNK as a sociological UNK is therefore not a direct consequence of observations but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical UNK and judgment STOP 
START the purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to UNK but to clarify the principles of social science STOP 
START it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline where sociology is essentially UNK and empirical STOP 
START such a position UNK the UNK of philosophy in its UNK form as something UNK above and UNK the empirical and mathematical sciences STOP 
START but contrary to UNK philosophy is not a UNK for plato STOP 
START the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are UNK to any approach that does not UNK to pure UNK STOP 
START however when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to UNK the conditions of empirical research it becomes formal metaphysics the contours of life to fit the needs of UNK STOP 
START the notion of philosophy as queen bee may fit well with UNK UNK of political ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy is the frustration and UNK of the social sciences STOP 
START UNK UNK 1952 2 UNK 5 UNK STOP 
START metaphysics is no longer a direct UNK with nature as it was in UNK STOP 
START it has UNK any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of UNK as in UNK system UNK STOP 
START science is UNK for UNK to know nothing of nothing in a last UNK effort to save the gods at the expense of men STOP 
START it is not UNK which has isolated metaphysics from reality by UNK between description and UNK STOP 
START it is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century STOP 
START consider the traditional four fields of philosophy logic ethics UNK and UNK STOP 
START it is a commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past UNK hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable UNK criteria they move away from philosophy as such STOP 
START what is left to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history of these fields prior to their becoming UNK enough to UNK by the UNK of scientific method STOP 
START in this situation philosophy has survived by UNK itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions STOP 
START the UNK by philosophy of UNK claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sorts STOP 
START in the new situation philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences a UNK of logical relations that can be used in UNK UNK having UNK and UNK value STOP 
START beyond this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry but within its potential UNK of UNK STOP 
START in this connection it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were UNK STOP 
START likewise UNK formulated the UNK hypothesis according to which the solar system was UNK from a rotating mass of UNK gas nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by UNK in his UNK du UNK STOP 
START this does not mean that philosophy UNK the problems it UNK any more so than UNK UNK settled the physical status of the UNK UNK STOP 
START but the UNK presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a UNK task STOP 
START to those raised on UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK this may seem a modest role for philosophy STOP 
START however UNK and UNK are different qualities STOP 
START philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which UNK as the sciences UNK STOP 
START the UNK effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has UNK since its primitive UNK status offers a more durable sort of drama STOP 
START by UNK fundamental UNK in the social sciences and UNK the logical problems UNK at the UNK of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can UNK growth in human understanding STOP 
START philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming UNK and UNK by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed STOP 
START the UNK of scientific theory the examination of a theory from the UNK of language UNK and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less so because of its removal from empirical research STOP 
START the realm of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers the range of UNK and explanation STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK 1948 75 STOP 
START whatever philosophy is conceived to be its UNK UNK attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science STOP 
START for some forms of philosophy this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter STOP 
START UNK and UNK announce that the secret is the center of a philosophy and thereafter a hundred followers UNK UNK a higher UNK STOP 
START this is simply a confession of intellectual UNK UNK up to look UNK STOP 
START for as UNK indicated 1953 it is not the secret which is important but the removal of UNK STOP 
START in this philosophy and science share a common goal STOP 
START the UNK of the secret UNK UNK that the division of UNK and synthetic UNK shall not be overcome by even the most UNK argument this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between UNK and science STOP 
START the UNK of metaphysical systems does not imply the UNK of philosophy only the close of a UNK age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical STOP 
START the UNK with which present metaphysical attitudes UNK private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and UNK ways of UNK is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology STOP 
START UNK UNK 1958 STOP 
START scientific systems and this includes even the relation of UNK to UNK physics are built upon UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK systems by the very nature of their UNK are UNK by rival systems STOP 
START in addition to the UNK of science and the UNK of metaphysics they differ in that science is essentially UNK while philosophy in its inherited forms tends to be UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the UNK notion that belief unlike UNK is not subject to objective analysis has placed UNK metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less UNK than social UNK STOP 
START when dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy in UNK research on the social sources of ideas one has to become necessarily selective STOP 
START certain features we have touched upon philosophy as a logical UNK system from which a social science UNK can be built up analysis of the assumptions and UNK of the social sciences philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly UNK sociological investigations STOP 
START the objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms UNK in the social sciences STOP 
START specifically it will be asked whether the real questions people ask are not the ultimate questions that social science finds itself UNK in the face of STOP 
START what then is the status of such questions as is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals society really exist as an UNK over and above the UNK of men think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical insistence these are questions so framed as to UNK either empirical exploration or rational solutions STOP 
START as UNK UNK and UNK UNK indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions but UNK of faith made to appear as legitimate questions STOP 
START such UNK assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving UNK UNK STOP 
START social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the UNK controversy STOP 
START it is not that such questions are not asked STOP 
START it is rather that UNK them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty STOP 
START an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either UNK or UNK STOP 
START to raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions having an UNK rather than scientific basis is in a real sense to UNK the objection itself STOP 
START for what concerns all scientific UNK is precisely that which can be captured for the rational i.e. for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and UNK STOP 
START a philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its UNK in the UNK of men an UNK with partial tentative solutions STOP 
START men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary STOP 
START uncertainty UNK itself is the UNK of the quest for new and more precise information about the world STOP 
START without such uncertainty we are left with a set of UNK and UNK STOP 
START the functional UNK of philosophy and science should as a minimum UNK a meaningful UNK to UNK STOP 
START a degree of UNK is a UNK condition for the growth of science STOP

START within only a few years UNK plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics industry and the end is still not yet in sight STOP 
START urethane foam as only one example was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955 STOP 
START yet last year's volume probably UNK 100 million lb. and expectations are for a market of UNK million lb. by UNK STOP 
START many of the other UNK plastics particularly the UNK show similar growth potential STOP 
START and there are even newer UNK plastics that are yet to be evaluated STOP 
START as this issue goes to press for example one manufacturer has announced an UNK foam with outstanding UNK and impact strength reports that a UNK UNK primarily for use in wire coating applications is being investigated STOP 
START on the following pages each of the major commercial UNK plastics is described in detail as to properties applications and methods of processing STOP 
START it might be well to point out however some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various UNK plastics involved STOP 
START in urethane foams for example there has been a definite trend toward the UNK materials which are now available in UNK rigid foam systems and the emphasis is definitely on UNK molding STOP 
START most manufacturers also seem to be UNK on UNK UNK or UNK grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the UNK building markets STOP 
START urethane foam as an UNK is also coming in for a good deal of attention STOP 
START in one outstanding example UNK corp. found that by UNK to urethane foam UNK they could increase the storage capacity of gas UNK to make them competitive with electric models STOP 
START much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams including UNK UNK and molding see article p. UNK for details STOP 
START and in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a UNK UNK new UNK and new methods of UNK foam to a substrate have been developed STOP 
START new techniques for automatic molding of UNK UNK UNK have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications including picnic UNK UNK UNK flower UNK and UNK swimming toys STOP 
START two other UNK areas which contributed to UNK UNK growth during the year were UNK molded UNK UNK complicated UNK units and UNK building panels STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK film or sheet claimed to be competitive UNK with paper also showed much potential particularly for UNK STOP 
START UNK panels for building utility shelters that consist of UNK paper UNK and rigid UNK foam UNK also aroused interest in the construction field STOP 
START in UNK foam the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material for details see p. UNK STOP 
START better hand a more UNK feel and better UNK properties were claimed to be the result STOP 
START several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for UNK or molding UNK products with a slight UNK core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent STOP 
START readers interested in additional information on foams are referred to the UNK plastics chart appearing in the technical data section and to the list of references which appears below STOP 
START urethane foams since the UNK UNK when urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market growth has been little short of fantastic STOP 
START present estimates are that production UNK the UNK mark in 1960 UNK to 90 million lb. for flexible 10 or 11 million lb. for rigid UNK production may range from 200 to UNK million lb. for flexible and from UNK to UNK million lb. for rigid STOP 
START the markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations STOP 
START furniture UNK as just one example can easily take millions of pounds refrigerator UNK is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer use of the foam for UNK UNK is only now getting off the ground with volume potential in the UNK STOP 
START basic chemistry urethane foams are basically reaction products of UNK materials and UNK usually UNK UNK STOP 
START blowing can be either one of two types carbon UNK gas generated by the reaction of water on the UNK or mechanical blowing through the use of a UNK liquid such as a UNK UNK STOP 
START the most important factor in determining what properties the UNK will have is quite naturally the type of UNK compound that is used in its production STOP 
START originally the main types used were various UNK of UNK STOP 
START these are still in wide use today particularly in UNK formulations for such applications as UNK for UNK structural panels UNK UNK UNK safety UNK arm rests etc. STOP 
START more recently UNK again in varied UNK molecular weights and UNK have come into use at first for the flexible foams just lately for the UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK are claimed to give flexible UNK a UNK action which is much desired in UNK STOP 
START although the first UNK foams on the market had to be produced by the UNK UNK method today thanks to new UNK they can be produced by a UNK technique STOP 
START it is possible that the UNK foams may soon be molded on a production basis in UNK UNK with more UNK contours and with superior properties to UNK foam STOP 
START the UNK urethane foam is generally produced with UNK acid UNK UNK group generally consists of foams produced with UNK UNK or UNK UNK modified with a UNK STOP 
START one shot vs. UNK in the UNK system the UNK and UNK are mixed UNK and no UNK occurs STOP 
START the UNK can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of UNK in solution STOP 
START in UNK the UNK UNK or UNK UNK UNK and other UNK are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately STOP 
START basically this means that simpler processing equipment the mixture has good flowing characteristics and less external heat the UNK reaction is UNK and develops internal heat are required in UNK UNK although at the same time the problems of controlling the conditions of UNK UNK are critical ones STOP 
START properties most commercial uses of urethane foams require UNK between 2 and 30 lb. UNK UNK for rigid foams between 1 and 3 lb. UNK UNK for flexible foams STOP 
START this latter figure UNK with UNK foam rubber at an average of UNK lb. UNK UNK in commercial grades STOP 
START UNK strength graph in fig. 1 p. UNK indicates how the ratio of UNK strength to density varies as the latter is increased or UNK STOP 
START the single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example STOP 
START by varying the formula this curve may be moved forward or backward along the UNK to produce any desired UNK strength density ratio STOP 
START thermal UNK and temperature resistance in flexible urethane foams we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the UNK primary performance remains UNK useful STOP 
START in temperature resistance this quality is usually related to specific properties e.g. UNK UNK UNK etc. STOP 
START thermal UNK is directly UNK to the UNK porous UNK construction which effectively UNK air or a gas in the UNK of minute bubbles which form its composition STOP 
START these air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers STOP 
START the UNK factor a term used to UNK the rate of heat transmission through a material UNK UNK of material of thickness UNK from UNK to UNK for flexible urethane foams and from UNK to UNK for rigid urethane foams depending upon the formulation density cell size and nature of blowing agents used STOP 
START table 1 p. UNK shows a comparison of UNK factor UNK of a number of commercial UNK materials in common use including two different types of rigid urethane foam STOP 
START UNK strength this term refers to the ability of a material to resist UNK stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by UNK STOP 
START the UNK urethane UNK foams usually have stronger UNK fatigue resistance i.e. the 12 lb. UNK UNK foam has 8 times the UNK strength of the 3 lb. UNK UNK density STOP 
START note that UNK strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another STOP 
START where UNK strength is an important factor be sure that your urethane foam UNK is aware of it STOP 
START UNK strength this property refers to the greatest UNK stress or tension a material can UNK without UNK apart STOP 
START like UNK strength of urethane foams it has a direct relationship to formulation STOP 
START exceptional UNK strength is another of urethane UNK strong features STOP 
START figure 2 above shows the UNK properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change in UNK strength during exposure to UNK light STOP 
START processing UNK there are many ways of producing a UNK urethane product STOP 
START the foam can be made into UNK stock and cut to shape it can be molded it can be UNK it can be applied by spray guns etc. STOP 
START UNK stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane UNK in use today STOP 
START basically the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more UNK units a variable UNK a UNK carriage assembly and in many cases a UNK belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it UNK into foam STOP 
START the UNK are fed from tanks through a UNK and into the UNK at a UNK rate STOP 
START the UNK head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the UNK STOP 
START it only takes a few minutes for the UNK action to be completed and after a short cure the material can be cut into lengths as desired STOP 
START much has been done in the way of UNK UNK to UNK the UNK stock into finished products STOP 
START profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce UNK UNK UNK and other UNK in variable heights dimensions etc. STOP 
START the UNK sheets can be combined to attain certain UNK effects UNK rather than UNK STOP 
START also available is a UNK which UNK the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to UNK continuous sheets up to 300 UNK in length down to 1 UNK thick STOP 
START the low cost and ease of UNK of the dies for UNK foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be UNK to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case UNK materials handling UNK UNK and UNK devices and such UNK as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports and gas UNK covers STOP 
START molding although UNK stock appeared first it soon became apparent that for the production of UNK with UNK shapes UNK contours or rounded edges the cutting of UNK stock is a UNK and UNK process STOP 
START only by UNK to molding techniques can the UNK manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established UNK market STOP 
START the closed molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material molding in open UNK was more feasible STOP 
START satisfactory methods for UNK foams and even UNK UNK foams were never fully achieved STOP 
START closed molding generally resulted in parts UNK more because of higher density than parts UNK from UNK foams STOP 
START this UNK the gain from having no UNK loss STOP 
START in addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of UNK strength in the rising foam and problems of UNK STOP 
START the introduction of UNK UNK foam systems aided by the development of new UNK helped to UNK some of the problems of closed molding STOP 
START while there are still many UNK to be UNK out the technique is fast developing STOP 
START other techniques simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured UNK etc. into a UNK where they foam up to fill the UNK STOP 
START in a typical application the making of rigid urethane foam UNK panels an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to UNK more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel UNK and the top of the panel is locked in place by a UNK STOP

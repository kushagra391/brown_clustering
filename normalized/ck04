START the bishop looked at him UNK and said take it or leave it there was nothing else to do STOP 
START he was caught in a machine STOP 
START but UNK was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly let's go and see what it's like STOP 
START UNK was about UNK miles west of birmingham near the georgia border and on the UNK river a small and dirty stream STOP 
START the city was a center of manufacture especially in textiles and also because of the beauty of some of its UNK a residence for many owners of the great industries in north alabama STOP 
START but it had as was usual in southern cities of this sort a black bottom a low region near the river where the negroes lived servants and UNK UNK together in a region with no sewage save the river where streets and UNK were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime STOP 
START wilson came by train from birmingham and looked the city over rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were STOP 
START beyond were industries and factories STOP 
START then they went down to black bottom STOP 
START in the midst of this crowded region was the allen african methodist UNK church STOP 
START it was an old and dirty wooden structure sadly in need of repair STOP 
START but it was a UNK STOP 
START it had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town black and white knew of it STOP 
START it had just suffered a UNK the final crisis in a long series of UNK STOP 
START for the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead and the city UNK him STOP 
START he was a UNK man once vigorous but for many years now UNK in strength and ability STOP 
START he was stern and UNK with his UNK but UNK and UNK with the whites especially the rich who partly supported the church STOP 
START the UNK board headed by a black man named UNK had practically taken over as the pastor grew old and had its way with the support of the amen corner STOP 
START the characteristic thing about this church was its amen corner and the weekly religious UNK STOP 
START a UNK of old UNK chiefly women listened weekly to a sermon STOP 
START it began invariably in low tones almost UNK and then gradually worked up to high UNK appeals to god and man STOP 
START and then the amen corner took hold UNK a form of group participation in worship that UNK from years before the greek chorus spreading down through the african forest overseas to the west UNK and then here in alabama STOP 
START with UNK and slow dance with tears and song with scream and UNK the corner group was UNK by UNK and shivering UNK shouting possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force STOP 
START it spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who UNK behind UNK and afterward discussed negro religion STOP 
START it sometimes ended in UNK UNK with many lying exhausted and UNK on chair and floor STOP 
START to most of those who composed the amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week to week STOP 
START it was often UNK in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer meeting STOP 
START wilson on his first sunday witnessed this with something like UNK STOP 
START he had UNK a short sermon trying to talk UNK to the audience to tell them who he was what he had done in UNK and birmingham and what he proposed to do here STOP 
START he UNK with them on the loss of their old pastor STOP 
START but then at mention of that name the amen corner broke loose STOP 
START he had no chance to say another word STOP 
START at the very end when the audience was silent and UNK a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out STOP 
START the audience did not think much of the new pastor and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say STOP 
START during the next weeks he looked over the situation STOP 
START first of all there was the UNK an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not repaired for years with no UNK or sewage with UNK and UNK STOP 
START it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church a woman named UNK who as wilson afterward found was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue and UNK initiative STOP 
START ann UNK was a lonely devoted soul never married conducting a UNK home and devoted to her church but a UNK UNK and born critic STOP 
START she UNK over the new pastor like an UNK angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief UNK STOP 
START then wilson looked over the church and studied its condition STOP 
START the salary of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in UNK STOP 
START wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least UNK but when he mentioned this to the UNK they said nothing STOP 
START the church itself must be repaired STOP 
START it was dirty and neglected STOP 
START it really ought to be UNK and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this STOP 
START meanwhile the city itself should be talked to STOP 
START the streets in the colored section were dirty STOP 
START there was UNK and UNK STOP 
START the children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even UNK STOP 
START the school was small dark and UNK STOP 
START the teacher was a UNK fool STOP 
START there were two liquor UNK not very far from the church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for negroes other exclusively negro STOP 
START undoubtedly there was a good deal of gambling in both STOP 
START on the other side of the church was a quiet UNK house with UNK and recently painted STOP 
START wilson inquired about it STOP 
START it was called kent house STOP 
START the UNK of the church UNK was its UNK STOP 
START one of the leading members of the amen corner was cook were two or three colored maids employed there STOP 
START wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people which seemed to him rather UNK STOP 
START why should a white hotel be set down in the center of black bottom nevertheless it looked respectable STOP 
START he was glad to have it there STOP 
START the rest of black bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect UNK and careful UNK STOP 
START UNK carefully repaired UNK and UNK painted and UNK UNK were UNK together cheek by UNK with little distinction STOP 
START the best could not escape from the worst and the worst UNK UNK beside the better STOP 
START the yards front and back were narrow were UNK UNK some had flower gardens STOP 
START behind were UNK for there was no sewage system STOP 
START after looking about a bit wilson discovered beyond black bottom across the river and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land and it occurred to him that the church and the better negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot STOP 
START he talked about it to the UNK elder STOP 
START the UNK elder looked him over rather carefully STOP 
START he was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand STOP 
START but there was one thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately STOP 
START in fact he UNK clearly that that was the reason that wilson had been sent here to make a larger contribution of dollar money STOP 
START wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a better church a more UNK conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of its UNK of wild worship into a modern church organization STOP 
START he emphasized to the UNK elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river STOP 
START the UNK elder was sure that that would be impossible STOP 
START but he told wilson to go ahead and try STOP 
START and wilson tried STOP 
START it did seem impossible STOP 
START the bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in UNK and the real estate people said UNK that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk STOP 
START when it was proposed to UNK the church wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high STOP 
START he was sure that he could do better if he went to atlanta to get the deal financed STOP 
START but when this proposal was made to his UNK board he met UNK opposition STOP 
START the church certainly would not be removed STOP 
START the very proposition was UNK STOP 
START it had been here fifty years STOP 
START it was going to stay forever STOP 
START it was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject STOP 
START as for UNK well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no hurry at all STOP 
START wilson again went downtown to a different UNK an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but he shook his head STOP 
START reverend he said i think you don't quite understand the situation here STOP 
START don't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church stores UNK some gambling i hope not too much STOP 
START the colored people are getting employment at kent house and other places and they are near their places of employment STOP 
START when a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them STOP 
START now if i were you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years STOP 
START by that time perhaps something better can be done STOP 
START then wilson asked what about this kent house which you mention don't understand why a white hotel should be down here STOP 
START the young UNK looked at him with a certain surprise and then he said UNK i'm afraid i can't tell you anything in particular about kent house STOP 
START you'll have to find out about it on your own STOP 
START hope to see you again STOP 
START and he dismissed the colored pastor STOP 
START it was next day that UNK came and sat beside him and took his hand STOP 
START she said my dear do you know what kent house is no said wilson i don't STOP 
START i was just asking about it STOP 
START what is it it's a house of UNK for white men with white girls as UNK STOP 
START they hire a good deal of local labor including two members of our UNK board STOP 
START they buy some supplies from our colored UNK and they are UNK by some of the best white gentlemen in town STOP 
START wilson stared at her STOP 
START my dear you must be mistaken STOP 
START talk to mrs. UNK she said STOP 
START and after wilson had talked to mrs. UNK and to others he was absolutely amazed STOP 
START this of course was the sort of thing that used to take place in southern cities putting white houses of UNK with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly STOP 
START but it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the negroes as they became more educated and got better wages STOP 
START but this situation of kent house was more subtle STOP 
START the wages involved were larger and more regular STOP 
START the UNK were white and from out of town avoiding local friction STOP 
START the UNK from the white town was greater and there was little publicity STOP 
START good wages UNK and UNK of various kinds stopped open protest from negroes STOP 
START and yet wilson knew that this place must go or he must go STOP 
START and for him to leave this job now without UNK anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not in all churches STOP

START that's what the man had said STOP 
START haney peered UNK at his drinking companion through UNK UNK eyes STOP 
START he had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of UNK STOP 
START was the man drunk or crazy or both his UNK buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the man's eyes were still clear STOP 
START the guy is off his UNK haney thought to himself and looked away from those eyes STOP 
START eyes that were clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them STOP 
START why hadn't he noticed it before the man was not drunk he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger STOP 
START but of course he remembered now STOP 
START it was UNK after two hours of steady drinking but the occasion of it came back to him STOP 
START the stranger his head seemingly UNK in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection STOP 
START UNK UNK and a horn UNK furiously but the man would have been hit if phil hadn't called out to him a second before STOP 
START his UNK had been UNK something anybody might have done without thinking on the spur of the moment STOP 
START as a matter of fact he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit STOP 
START actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them STOP 
START by then the stranger was UNK haney UNK and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend STOP 
START so the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his UNK record STOP 
START then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck UNK face without saying a word STOP 
START very suddenly the driver stopped UNK at them turned on his UNK and went back to his truck STOP 
START haney hadn't given it much thought at the time STOP 
START now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off STOP 
START it must have been the sort of look that can call a UNK without saying a word STOP 
START when the light went their way they went on across the street STOP 
START and when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them STOP 
START phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite UNK STOP 
START but he decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks even though he made good money at his job STOP 
START phil was like that STOP 
START now he wondered if it was worth it having a UNK for company STOP 
START he really didn't take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy STOP 
START when he finally got the UNK under control he realized that pete all he gave was his first name was still waiting for an answer he didn't even seem to UNK as he continued to stare STOP 
START haney managed a weak laugh STOP 
START guess i can't think of anyone pete STOP 
START thanks anyhow STOP 
START a faint UNK appeared between the man's UNK STOP 
START i think you aren't taking me seriously phil STOP 
START i meant it STOP 
START and everybody has some kind of UNK STOP 
START i might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you STOP 
START i believe in returning UNK STOP 
START i'll do anything for somebody i like STOP 
START it won't cost you a cent phil STOP 
START go ahead and try me rubbed his forehead UNK STOP 
START he was beginning to feel UNK STOP 
START maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an UNK STOP 
START he really didn't expect anything to come of it and there were a few people all right he conceded finally if you must know i don't get along with the landlord STOP 
START he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio and sing while i'm taking a bath STOP 
START he says the neighbors complain but i don't believe it STOP 
START why don't they tell me themselves if it UNK them man closed his eyes and nodded STOP 
START when he looked up again he seemed almost UNK STOP 
START fine STOP 
START give me your address STOP 
START it will take a little time STOP 
START i want to study your UNK habits and movements first STOP 
START you see i always make it look like an accident STOP 
START maybe suicide if it looks reasonable STOP 
START in that way there's no trouble for the customer STOP 
START UNK UNK flew up STOP 
START customer smiled UNK STOP 
START it's my line of work he said five minutes later before haney could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell STOP 
START haney watched the small but UNK man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure STOP 
START phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table STOP 
START some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the UNK putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep STOP 
START the next day sunday the UNK reminded haney where he had been the night before STOP 
START the UNK in turn reminded him of his conversation with the UNK and he UNK STOP 
START he went for more UNK later in the day and passed the UNK landlord on the way he was still alive and UNK as usual as if UNK were a burden in his life STOP 
START phil shrugged and ignored him STOP 
START he went back to work monday STOP 
START by wednesday the landlord was still alive STOP 
START of course on thursday haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife UNK and wished the stranger could do something about her coming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building STOP 
START inside the lobby people were standing around talking UNK STOP 
START his UNK crawled with a UNK UNK as he asked one of his fellow UNK what had happened STOP 
START the landlord had died STOP 
START late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure UNK or inspection STOP 
START he had apparently been alone STOP 
START nobody witnessed the fall just the UNK impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance STOP 
START haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden UNK as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks STOP 
START he muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate UNK to the elevator STOP 
START once inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and UNK UNK in a chair STOP 
START after a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions STOP 
START but after all why should they later he finally convinced himself that it was an accident just a coincidence STOP 
START the stranger really had nothing to do with it of course haney went to bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord STOP 
START after all the man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off for it STOP 
START really he said to himself nobody UNK a man just as a favor you thought i didn't mean what i said STOP 
START the UNK eyes were large and sad as if phil haney had hurt his feelings STOP 
START it was like a UNK UNK dream but now the dream was beginning to take on UNK of a UNK STOP 
START however haney knew it was not a dream STOP 
START he might be very tight but he knew where he was STOP 
START it was the same bar and it was two weeks later saturday night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual STOP 
START he had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible from any UNK friendly UNK STOP 
START he was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his UNK UNK with UNK slightly UNK with water STOP 
START this favorite UNK was not the landlord STOP 
START he had already quite forgotten about him STOP 
START in fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment STOP 
START his real UNK was UNK STOP 
START toward the end of his fourth UNK UNK while he was UNK making wet UNK on the UNK with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone STOP 
START he looked up with UNK eyes and UNK the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him as if they were fellow UNK STOP 
START he hadn't even noticed what was his name he hadn't seen him sit down STOP 
START the man was UNK like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow STOP 
START haney felt like UNK out of sight but he was already UNK in the corner with the UNK dark little man STOP 
START he began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing STOP 
START was he going to be UNK from now on with a UNK for a UNK have to start going to some of the other places again STOP 
START in a low voice almost UNK the man had asked phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back STOP 
START he made the mistake of answering in an UNK way and instantly realized that his UNK must have showed in his face or voice STOP 
START pete UNK slightly then became sad and UNK STOP 
START haney didn't want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble STOP 
START but there was no trouble STOP 
START the guy UNK over his drink obviously upset by UNK lack of appreciation STOP 
START to break the uncomfortable silence haney began to talk STOP 
START in time and two drinks later he was UNK bitterly about his wife he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his UNK it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes STOP 
START when he paused to UNK his throat the stranger broke in STOP 
START but why pay her bills she runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not just divorce her UNK STOP 
START that UNK would love a divorce he UNK STOP 
START then she'd get half of everything i have STOP 
START community property deal you know STOP 
START i'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share STOP 
START she can drop dead nodded UNK STOP 
START oh yes STOP 
START now i see STOP 
START you must understand i haven't been in this state too long STOP 
START i came out here to UNK STOP 
START that's why i why i do a free job now and then STOP 
START you should have told me about her before STOP 
START haney felt a UNK of UNK when he heard the now familiar line again STOP 
START then a wild thought ran circles through his UNK brain STOP 
START suppose just suppose this guy was really what he said he was retired professional killer if he was just a nut no harm was done STOP 
START but if he was the real thing he could do something about UNK STOP 
START he felt very UNK very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot STOP 
START no UNK intended he said gently STOP 
START but it's just that well you know STOP 
START the cops didn't suspect a thing and i thought it was a coincidence STOP 
START after all i didn't know you pete STOP 
START it could have been an accident STOP 
START he shrugged casually STOP 
START but if you say you managed it the stranger was UNK STOP 
START his eyes burned UNK STOP 
START yes yes he muttered UNK STOP 
START of course it looked like an accident STOP 
START i always work it that way and always at a time when the customer has an UNK STOP 
START let me prove it phil STOP 
START i think i can manage one more favor for you STOP 
START he waited eagerly STOP 
START haney UNK the liquor in the bottom of his glass STOP

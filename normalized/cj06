START the thermal exchange of chlorine between af and liquid af is readily UNK at temperatures in the range of UNK and above STOP 
START the UNK exchange occurs with a UNK yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at UNK using light absorbed only by the af STOP 
START in the gas phase with af of af and af of af UNK UNK of the order of af have been observed at UNK STOP 
START despite extensive attempts to obtain highly pure UNK serious difficulty was experienced in UNK UNK rates of reaction STOP 
START it appears possible to set a lower limit of about af for the UNK energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride UNK by a chlorine atom to form af radical STOP 
START the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light intensity indicating that the radical UNK are removed at the walls or by reaction with an UNK rather than by UNK radical combination reactions STOP 
START introduction because of the simplicity of the UNK UNK exchange reactions between elemental UNK and the corresponding carbon UNK would appear to offer particularly UNK possibilities for UNK UNK basic UNK data STOP 
START it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and UNK reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for UNK energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free UNK as well as information on the heat of UNK of the UNK bond STOP 
START the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed particularly suited for such studies STOP 
START it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic UNK on a vacuum system followed by multiple UNK of the liquid STOP 
START it should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any UNK substances by the usual UNK methods followed by UNK prior to addition of UNK chlorine STOP 
START furthermore the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of UNK because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the UNK energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high it would be expected that af would compete very effectively with any UNK as a UNK for af UNK STOP 
START contrary to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree of UNK one would wish even with extensive efforts to prepare especially pure UNK STOP 
START we are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their UNK to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the UNK energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride STOP 
START experimental UNK STOP 
START UNK highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a tube of UNK af into an UNK UNK system where it was UNK with liquid air STOP 
START it was then UNK at least three times from a trap at UNK to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction being retained in each UNK STOP 
START the UNK product was stored at UNK in a tube equipped with a break seal STOP 
START of several methods employed for UNK chlorine with UNK the exchange of UNK chlorine with UNK aluminum UNK at room temperature was found to be the most satisfactory STOP 
START to prepare the latter silver UNK was UNK from a solution containing af obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory STOP 
START the silver UNK was UNK under vacuum in the presence of aluminum UNK with the resultant product of af which was UNK into a UNK on the vacuum line STOP 
START previously UNK chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange was allowed to take place STOP 
START the UNK was stored at UNK in a tube equipped with a break seal STOP 
START UNK quantities of UNK low UNK UNK grade carbon tetrachloride were UNK with af and af and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 UNK UNK lamp at a distance of a few inches STOP 
START the mixture was then UNK with UNK and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride was UNK on a UNK column a UNK center cut being retained which was then UNK under vacuum in the presence of af STOP 
START UNK UNK chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a UNK equipped with a break seal STOP 
START this UNK tetrachloride solution was illuminated for a day following which the UNK was UNK onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine UNK off STOP 
START the required amount of carbon tetrachloride was UNK into a series of reaction cells on a manifold on a vacuum line STOP 
START the desired amounts of UNK chlorine and UNK chlorine were likewise UNK in these cells on the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold as a whole was sealed off STOP 
START the contents of the manifold for liquid phase experiments were then mixed by shaking UNK to the reaction tubes frozen down and each tube was then sealed off STOP 
START the UNK for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a UNK attached to the manifold and then allowed to UNK slowly into the manifold of UNK reaction cells before UNK off STOP 
START this method in general solved the problem of UNK fairly equal UNK of UNK in each of the six cells from a set STOP 
START reaction conditions and analysis STOP 
START -hl-- the samples for liquid phase thermal reaction studies were prepared in UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and about 15 cm. long STOP 
START in a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 UNK UNK UNK UNK of 1 UNK wall thickness STOP 
START both types of tube UNK the pressure of approximately 20 UNK exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at UNK STOP 
START the UNK reaction cells consisted of 10 UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK cm. long UNK effects being UNK by the fact that the light passed through only UNK UNK and not UNK UNK STOP 
START these cells were used rather than square UNK UNK because of the tendency of the latter to UNK when UNK frozen carbon tetrachloride STOP 
START the round cells were UNK UNK in the light beam which entered the UNK mineral UNK through a window STOP 
START two types of light source were used a thousand UNK UNK lamp and an UNK high pressure UNK arc STOP 
START the light was UNK by the soft glass window of the UNK thus UNK that only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell STOP 
START relative incident light UNK were measured with a UNK UNK system STOP 
START changes of intensity on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying the distance of the light source from the cell STOP 
START following reaction the cells were UNK with a file and opened under a UNK aqueous sodium UNK solution STOP 
START UNK af was added and the aqueous and organic phases were separated cells containing UNK UNK were UNK in liquid air before opening under sodium UNK STOP 
START after UNK of the UNK af with af UNK of the aqueous and of the organic phase were counted in a UNK UNK tube STOP 
START in the liquid phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was determined by UNK the tube before opening and UNK the UNK after UNK STOP 
START the fraction of exchange was determined as the ratio of the counts minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the counts minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride UNK determined UNK being made for the difference in counting efficiency of af in af and af STOP 
START results the thermal reaction STOP 
START -hl-- in studying the liquid phase thermal reaction some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold UNK were prepared and analyzed STOP 
START experiments were done at UNK 200 UNK and UNK STOP 
START following observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly identical reaction UNK prepared on the same filling manifold and exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per cent a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether the difficulty could be UNK to the method of preparing the chlorine to the effects of oxygen or UNK or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tubes STOP 
START in addition to the method described in the section above chlorine and UNK were prepared by the UNK of a af UNK on the vacuum line and by exchange of af with UNK af STOP 
START calcium UNK was substituted for af as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride STOP 
START no correlation between these variables and the UNK of the results was found STOP 
START the reaction rates observed at UNK ranged from af of the chlorine UNK per hour to UNK UNK per hour STOP 
START in most cases the chlorine concentration was about af STOP 
START sets of reaction tubes containing UNK of an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added UNK in another both gave reaction rates in the range of UNK to UNK of the chlorine UNK per hour STOP 
START no UNK reaction was found at room temperature for reaction UNK allowed to stand up to 5 hours STOP 
START the liquid phase UNK reaction STOP 
START -hlthe liquid phase UNK exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more UNK than the thermal exchange although still UNK STOP 
START the improvement was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells prepared as a group on the same manifold STOP 
START rather large differences were still found between reaction cells from different manifold UNK STOP 
START some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold UNK were illuminated in the temperature range from 40 to UNK in a further UNK to determine the cause of the UNK and to obtain information on the UNK energy and the effect of light intensity STOP 
START in all cases there was readily UNK exchange after as little as one hour of UNK STOP 
START by UNK reaction cells sealed from the same manifold temperature UNK corresponding to UNK energies ranging from 11 to 18 af was observed while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases STOP 
START it was possible to make estimates of the UNK yield by observing the extent of reduction of a UNK UNK UNK solution illuminated for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate UNK based on the differences in the absorption spectra of UNK UNK and of chlorine and considering the UNK distribution of the light source STOP 
START these estimates indicated that the UNK yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at UNK is of the order of magnitude of unity STOP 
START when typical reaction cells to which UNK of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated chlorine and UNK were produced STOP 
START exchange was also observed in these cells which had chlorine present at af STOP 
START the UNK exchange in the gas phase STOP 
START -hl-- although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace UNK or to variation in wall effects the UNK exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently UNK so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of UNK information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate STOP 
START data on such UNK together with data on the effect of light intensity are given in table 1 STOP 
START in series 1 the relative light intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from UNK to UNK cm. STOP 
START the last column shows the rate of exchange that would have been observed at a relative intensity of 4 UNK cm. distance calculated on the assumptions that the incident light intensity is UNK proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly proportional to the incident light intensity STOP 
START direct UNK of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in UNK the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen STOP

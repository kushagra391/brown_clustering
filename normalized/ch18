START foreign policy in its total context with this UNK role in mind i should like to make a few suggestions what we in the united states do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world STOP 
START we in this department must think about foreign policy in its total context STOP 
START we cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been UNK STOP 
START foreign policy is the total involvement of the american people with peoples and governments abroad STOP 
START that means that if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in terms of the total context of our situation STOP 
START it is the concern of the department of state that the american people are safe and secure defense is not a monopoly concern of the department of defense STOP 
START it is also the concern of the department of state that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous profitable and active this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce STOP 
START we can no longer rely on UNK machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve differences between this and other departments STOP 
START assistant UNK of state will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies STOP 
START means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as UNK as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy STOP 
START i think we need to concern ourselves also with the UNK of action STOP 
START every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer STOP 
START unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present STOP 
START the movement of events is so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to UNK into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present STOP 
START if there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs STOP 
START action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control STOP 
START there will of course be times for delay and UNK STOP 
START what i am suggesting is that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so UNK and not through UNK or through UNK or UNK difficulties STOP 
START i also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant UNK rate of ideas an UNK of all UNK STOP 
START we want to UNK ideas from the bottom to the top of the department STOP 
START we want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top STOP 
START i hope no one expects that only presidential UNK are looked upon as sources of ideas STOP 
START the responsibility for taking the initiative in UNK ideas is that of every officer in the department who has a policy function regardless of rank STOP 
START further i would hope that we could pay attention to little things STOP 
START while observing the operations of our government in various parts of the world i have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which UNK our main effort STOP 
START to UNK only a few examples the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to our policy attitudes of a u.n. UNK who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in new york city or of a foreign UNK in similar circumstances in our capital can easily be directed against the united states and all that it stands for STOP 
START dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world STOP 
START sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them STOP 
START i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them STOP 
START if the department of state is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas STOP 
START this does not mean in a purely UNK sense but in an active operational interested responsible fashion STOP 
START he is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are UNK in his country STOP 
START he is expected to UNK to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can STOP 
START if any official operation abroad begins to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for UNK action STOP 
START the problems of a policy officer it occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which i expressed privately in recent years in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means and of developing a certain UNK for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside government STOP 
START i tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior UNK policy officer faces STOP 
START this means practically everybody in this room STOP 
START whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine STOP 
START the senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of UNK an idea in his own head the suggestions of a UNK a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another department a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad the filing of an item for the UNK of the united nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies a news item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman an article in a UNK a resolution from a national organization a request for assistance from some private american interests abroad et UNK ad UNK STOP 
START the policy officer lives with his UNK UNK for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility STOP 
START his first thought is about the question itself is there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what is it he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself and that the way in which it is UNK frequently shapes the answer STOP 
START chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind he reaches a tentative identification of the question tentative because it may change as he UNK it further and because if no UNK answer can be found it may have to be changed into one which can be answered STOP 
START meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem facts which he knows can never be complete and the general background much of which has already been lost to history STOP 
START he is UNK of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which UNK their frequently UNK conclusions STOP 
START he knows that he must give the expert his place but he knows that he must also keep him in it STOP 
START he is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action including doing nothing STOP 
START he knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a UNK fog STOP 
START but he takes his UNK from the great UNK of policy UNK UNK the commitments of the united states under international UNK and UNK basic UNK and UNK notions of the american people about how we are to conduct ourselves in policy literature such as country papers and national security council papers UNK in the department STOP 
START he will not be surprised to find that general principles produce UNK results in the UNK situation with which he is confronted STOP 
START he must think about which of these principles must take UNK STOP 
START he will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance STOP 
START he is aware that every UNK important problem UNK UNK into every other problem STOP 
START he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole when the whole is too large to grasp STOP 
START he must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer STOP 
START who should be consulted among his colleagues in the department or other departments and agencies of the government american UNK could provide helpful advice private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted is the probable attitude of other governments including those less directly involved and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted action is indicated what kind of action is relevant to the problem selection of the wrong tools can mean waste at best and at worst an UNK UNK of the problem itself STOP 
START can the president or the secretary act under existing authority or will new legislation and new money be required the action be UNK or UNK the matter one for the united nations or some other international body if so the path leads through a complex process of UNK diplomacy which UNK still another dimension to the problem STOP 
START respect for the opinions of mankind what type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it STOP 
START he is interested in public opinion for two reasons first because it is important in itself and second because he knows that the american public UNK about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind STOP 
START and given probable public attitudes about which reasonably good estimates can be made what action is called for to insure necessary support i add a caution on this particular point do not want policy officers below the level of presidential UNK to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in UNK foreign policy action STOP 
START in the first place our business is foreign policy and it is the business of the presidential leadership and his UNK in the department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem STOP 
START mr. truman emphasized this point by saying you fellows in the department of state don't know much about domestic politics STOP 
START this is an important consideration STOP 
START if we sit here reading UNK and looking at UNK UNK and other reports that cross our UNK we should realize that this is raw UNK opinion expressed in the absence of leadership STOP 
START what the american people will do turns in large degree on their leadership STOP 
START we cannot test public opinion until the president and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action STOP 
START i doubt for example that 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the marshall plan any UNK expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals STOP 
START the problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a UNK of utterly complicated factors political military economic financial legal legislative UNK administrative to be UNK out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control STOP 
START and the policy officer has the UNK of time UNK at his heels STOP

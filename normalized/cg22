START does our society have a UNK UNK growth of technology which may end our civilization or a normal healthy growth there may be an analogy with cancer we can UNK UNK by their rapidly UNK growth UNK only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth STOP 
START should the UNK growth of technology then warn us such evidence is the first step almost the only cure is early detection and removal STOP 
START one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our UNK organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before STOP 
START so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly UNK situation STOP 
START in any event whether society may have cancer or merely a virus UNK the disease we shall find is political economical social and even medical STOP 
START have not our physical abilities already UNK because of the more UNK lives we are now living the prime issue as i see it is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature STOP 
START we are already committed to establishing man's UNK over nature and everywhere on earth not merely in the limited UNK context we are fond of today STOP 
START otherwise we go on UNK trying to draw the line color and other as to which kind of man we wish to see UNK STOP 
START we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to UNK we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely UNK if nothing else STOP 
START we must believe we have the ability to affect our own UNK otherwise why try anything in these pages the term technology is used to include any and all means which could UNK project or UNK man's control over himself and over other men STOP 
START naturally this includes all communication forms e.g. languages or any social political economic or religious structures employed for such control STOP 
START properly UNK of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution STOP 
START if we were creating a wholly new society we could insist that our social political economic and UNK institutions foster rather than UNK man growth STOP 
START but we cannot start off with a clean UNK STOP 
START so we must first UNK our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs STOP 
START asked which institution most needs UNK i would say the corporation as it exists in america today STOP 
START at first glance this appears strange of all people was not america founded by rugged UNK who established a new way of life still UNK UNK societies abroad hear UNK e. UNK former moscow correspondent of the new york times and author of to moscow and beyond STOP 
START in a book review of the soviet cultural UNK he says long before the state department organized its UNK into an UNK contacts staff in order to wage a cultural UNK within soviet borders the sharp UNK of american culture had carved its mark across the russian UNK as when the UNK UNK of UNK and UNK UNK the state department to carry the contemporary cultural warfare behind the enemy lines STOP 
START they were not UNK or jazz musicians or even UNK of UNK and UNK displays but rugged UNK UNK like henry ford UNK cooper thomas UNK the international UNK co. and david w. griffith STOP 
START their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world an industrial and technological culture which UNK russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a UNK from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to UNK UNK or program a series of UNK of interested agencies STOP 
START this favorable image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic UNK propaganda corporations now UNK STOP 
START perhaps the UNK present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the rugged UNK UNK no more exists in america STOP 
START in his UNK is a UNK version known as the corporation STOP 
START but even if we cannot see the UNK characteristics in this new image of america foreigners can our loss of prestige abroad is the direct result STOP 
START no amount of UNK will cover up the UNK facts STOP 
START if we want respect from ourselves or others we will have to earn it STOP 
START first let us realize that whatever good this UNK achieved in earlier times now the corporation per UNK cannot take economic leadership STOP 
START businesses must develop as a result of the ideas energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind STOP 
START when we forced individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal UNK we adopted what i would term UNK and so took a major step toward socialism STOP 
START the biggest loss of course was the individual's UNK desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy STOP 
START socialism i grant has a definite place in our society STOP 
START but let us not complain of the UNK of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly UNK STOP 
START some forms of capitalism do indeed work superb organizations a credit to any society STOP 
START but the UNK which UNK our whole economy as well as our politics and social life will not stand close scrutiny STOP 
START its UNK to operate in the public interest is little more than a UNK STOP 
START it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that STOP 
START as a creative enterprise its abilities are primarily in UNK creative enterprises developed outside its own organization an ability made possible by us and almost UNK STOP 
START as to benefits to employees it is UNK for its UNK UNK except where it depends on them for services STOP 
START the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism UNK in a sense with the other UNK form that has emerged within governmental UNK STOP 
START but while the corporation has all the UNK of the socialist form of organization so UNK it cannot UNK do much of anything not compatible with its need to UNK itself and maintain its status quo UNK it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole STOP 
START so we are faced with a vast network of UNK entities UNK themselves in whatever manner they can without regard to the needs of society controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the UNK needs for survival STOP 
START the corporation has a limited specific place in our society STOP 
START UNK speaking it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society STOP 
START examples are in public UNK making military aircraft and UNK or where the investment and risk for a UNK would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form e.g. UNK major UNK or UNK STOP 
START thus if corporations are not to run away with us they must become UNK institutions subject to public control and needs STOP 
START in all other areas private initiative of the UNK type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services STOP 
START UNK avoiding UNK technology can be done only by UNK a UNK society for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests STOP 
START such genuine human leadership the UNK can offer corporations cannot STOP 
START it can project long-range goals for itself STOP 
START corporations react violently to UNK UNK e.g. UNK and annual UNK reports STOP 
START UNK can establish a unity and UNK of control being more UNK cannot STOP 
START UNK can establish a meaningful identity representing a human personality and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community STOP 
START corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal UNK UNK and almost exclusively UNK a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public STOP 
START the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders STOP 
START leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop STOP 
START men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied complicated and trying type so that at UNK they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so UNK needed now STOP 
START hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest STOP 
START UNK should get the tax advantages now UNK to corporations e.g. the chance to UNK capital so vital for growth STOP 
START corporations should pay added taxes to be used for educational purposes not necessarily of the formal type STOP 
START the right to leave UNK should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated STOP 
START to UNK wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation UNK those with real initiative from coming to the UNK and is basically UNK STOP 
START when the proprietor dies the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it STOP 
START strikes should be declared UNK against corporations because UNK would have to be settled by government representatives acting as UNK of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against UNK because employees and UNK must be completely UNK as they are each a part of the whole STOP 
START strikes threatening the security of the UNK if UNK UNK prevent a healthy relationship STOP 
START certainly external forces should not be applied UNK out of mere power available to do so STOP 
START if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system how can we expect to UNK it UNK kind of UNK these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere UNK growth of the individual who in turn would help us to cope with UNK technology STOP 
START individual human strength is needed to pit against an UNK condition STOP 
START the battle is not easy STOP 
START we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed UNK competent leaders STOP 
START persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside STOP 
START in my own company in effect a partnership although UNK a corporation i have been able to do many things for my employees which normal corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do STOP 
START also i am convinced that if my company were a sole UNK instead of a partnership i would have been even UNK to solve long-range problems for myself and my UNK STOP 
START any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business coupled with raising my family STOP 
START this combined experience on a foundation of very average i assure you intelligence and background has helped me do things many UNK people would bet heavily against STOP 
START perhaps a list of some of the practices of my company will help here STOP 
START the company grew out of efforts by two completely UNK men in their late UNK neither having a formal education applicable to or experience in manufacturing or selling our type of articles STOP 
START from an initial investment of UNK in 1943 it has grown with no additional capital investment to a present value estimated by some as UNK UNK we don't UNK financial figures to the public STOP 
START its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth no UNK is in evidence STOP 
START our UNK UNK and UNK nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time despite substantial well established competition STOP

START she describes first the imaginary reaction of a UNK puzzled by this UNK UNK is answered by a confused honest englishman STOP 
START the reasons for the UNK joy on this occasion are found to be their expectation of UNK control of the government their delight at the prospect of a new war their hopes of having the UNK UNK and so on STOP 
START as for the author of the englishman mrs. UNK UNK UNK that the sole defense of the protestant cause should be left to UNK dick steele and their associates with the UNK of young man's UNK STOP 
START another controversy typical of the war between the englishman and the examiner centered on robert later UNK UNK a UNK leader in ireland and a member of the irish UNK council STOP 
START on december 21 the day that the irish house of UNK UNK for removal of sir UNK UNK their tory lord chancellor UNK UNK made this remark on the defense of UNK by UNK they that have turned the world UNK down are come UNK also STOP 
START upon UNK from the lower house of UNK to the house of UNK he was removed from the UNK council his remark having been represented as a UNK UNK to the clergy STOP 
START steele who had earlier praised UNK in UNK no. UNK now defended him in englishman no. UNK UNK his removal as a UNK to the constitution STOP 
START on the other hand UNK was naturally UNK in the tory press STOP 
START swift in the UNK edition of a UNK to the bishop of UNK introduction indicated his feelings by including UNK along with UNK UNK and UNK in the group of those who like UNK are engaged in UNK all UNK of the clergy STOP 
START in the same way he coupled UNK and UNK in a letter to UNK king and he had earlier described him as the worst of them in some observations on the irish UNK council submitted to oxford STOP 
START a month later in the UNK spirit of the UNK he used steele's defense of UNK as evidence of his UNK for the clergy calling steele's position an UNK to the whole UNK of ireland STOP 
START on this issue then as on so many in these months steele and swift took UNK opposed points of view STOP 
START in the early months of UNK the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession entered its major phase STOP 
START the UNK ended with the publication of steele's crisis on january 19 and from that point on the fight proceeded at a rapid pace STOP 
START in answer to the crisis swift produced the UNK spirit of the UNK his most extensive and bitter attack on his old friend STOP 
START by this time as we shall see the UNK were already planning to UNK steele for his political writing by UNK him from the house of UNK STOP 
START despite his defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in his speech before the house their efforts were successful STOP 
START steele lost his seat in parliament and his personal quarrel with swift by now a public issue thus reached its climax STOP 
START of all the UNK UNK written in support of the succession the crisis is perhaps the most significant STOP 
START certainly it is the most UNK and elaborate STOP 
START UNK agents UNK in promoting circulation said to have reached UNK and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writers the work must have had considerable impact STOP 
START steele's main business here is to UNK public opinion to the immediate danger of a stuart restoration STOP 
START to this end the first and UNK section of the tract UNK all the laws enacted since the revolution to defend england against the arbitrary power of a UNK prince STOP 
START in his comment on these laws steele sounds all the usual notes of current UNK propaganda ranging from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the UNK of UNK his principal theme is that the UNK of the UNK our UNK or UNK party pose an immediate threat to church and state STOP 
START like UNK he UNK the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis STOP 
START UNK books striking at the UNK succession he UNK are allowed to pass UNK STOP 
START in this connection swift too is drawn in for attack the author of the conduct of the allies has dared to drop UNK about UNK the succession STOP 
START in his effort to UNK the public from its UNK steele goes so far as to list catholic UNK of the sort to be expected in the event of a stuart restoration and with UNK UNK he UNK that the only preservation from these UNK is to be found in the laws he has so UNK cited STOP 
START it is no time he writes to talk with UNK and UNK but openly and honestly to UNK our UNK before our enemies have UNK and put their designs in execution against us STOP 
START steele apparently UNK his UNK in this book too openly and honestly for his own good since the government was soon to use it as evidence against him in his trial before the house STOP 
START in the final issues of the englishman which ended just as the new session of parliament began he provided his enemies with still more ammunition STOP 
START for example no. UNK printed the patent giving the electoral prince the title of duke of cambridge STOP 
START in a few months the duke was to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the UNK question of the protestant succession STOP 
START at the order of the UNK UNK the UNK agents supported by the UNK leaders demanded that a UNK of UNK be issued which would call the duke to england to sit in parliament thus further UNK the succession by establishing a UNK prince in england before the UNK death STOP 
START anne was UNK and UNK advised that the request be refused STOP 
START oxford realizing that the law required the UNK of the UNK took the opposite view for which the queen never UNK him STOP 
START accordingly the request was granted but the UNK himself who had not been consulted by his mother rejected the proposal and recalled his agent UNK whose UNK handling of the affair had caused the UNK interest to suffer and had made UNK UNK more likely than ever STOP 
START steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a plan STOP 
START a few days after this englishman appeared UNK reported to oxford that steele was expected to move in parliament that the duke be called over then commented if they could draw that young gentleman into their measures they would show themselves quickly for they are not UNK to say they want only a head to make a beginning STOP 
START the final issue of the englishman no. UNK for february 15 ran to some length and was printed as a separate UNK entitled the englishman being the close of the paper so-called STOP 
START steele's purpose is to present a general defense of his political writing and a resume of the UNK which had occupied him in the englishman there is much here also which bears directly on his personal quarrel with swift STOP 
START thus he UNK with considerable justice that the tory writers have UNK to UNK instead of answering his arguments STOP 
START his birth education and fortune he says have all been UNK simply because he has spoken with the freedom of an englishman and he UNK the reader that whoever talks with me is speaking to a gentleman born STOP 
START as notable examples of this abuse he UNK passages from the examiner that UNK of all things and the character of richard steele which he here attributes to swift STOP 
START though put in rather UNK terms steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis STOP 
START his point is simply that the UNK have UNK him with personal UNK despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right to speak on political matters without UNK the UNK of the sovereign STOP 
START he claims too that his political convictions are simply those which are called revolution principles and which are accepted by moderate men in both parties STOP 
START the final section of this UNK is of special interest in a consideration of steele's relations with swift STOP 
START it UNK to be a letter from steele to a friend at court who in miss UNK opinion could only be meant as swift STOP 
START steele first answers briefly the charges which his dear old friend has made about his UNK on UNK and his crisis STOP 
START then he UNK into an attack on the tory ministers whom he calls the new UNK this term he means to UNK their UNK of acting in the interest of the church despite their own education and manner of life a UNK in other words at the UNK in UNK family and at UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the tory leaders he UNK are UNK using the church as a political UNK to increase party friction and keep themselves in power STOP 
START this is the principal point made in this final section of englishman no. UNK and it UNK steele's efforts in his other writing of these months to UNK the notion of the UNK as a church party supported by the body of the clergy STOP 
START next steele turns his attention to the UNK he is UNK STOP 
START he explains that there are sometimes honorable UNK but that too often a man who UNK at court does not UNK to sacrifice his sovereign and nation to his own UNK and ambition STOP 
START such he implies is the case with his friend who is not really a new convert himself but merely a UNK of new UNK STOP 
START if jack the UNK is really to be taken as swift the following remark is obviously steele's comment on UNK change of parties and its effect on their friendship i assure you dear jack when i first found out such an UNK in you as makes you of so UNK a constitution that you may be worked into any form an UNK UNK i UNK i should not enjoy your UNK much longer STOP 
START he UNK his letter by demanding that UNK be UNK that the UNK be forced to move farther away from the coast of england and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a better understanding STOP 
START the last point was soon to be included in the UNK remarks used against him in parliament STOP 
START the examiner during steele's trial a month later printed an answer from the UNK addressed to r. s. at UNK UNK STOP 
START he UNK steele's entrance into politics and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of UNK to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly should be credited to the UNK of his friends STOP 
START once more in other words steele is said to be UNK to swift for his wit was the form in which their private UNK most often appeared in the tory press especially the examiner STOP 
START in the UNK spirit of the UNK it may be noted swift himself UNK dismissed steele's reference to his friend at court i suppose by the style of old friend and the like it must be some body there of his own level whom his party have indeed more friends than i could wish STOP 
START on february 16 steele took his seat in parliament STOP 
START by now he was undergoing a fresh UNK of abuse from tory papers and UNK and action was being taken to effect his punishment by UNK from parliament STOP 
START on the very day that the UNK session began another UNK UNK appeared entitled a letter from the UNK dr. andrew UNK at bath to the UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START it is filled with the usual personal abuse of steele especially of his physical appearance the opening paragraph too steele is accused of extreme UNK of giving himself the UNK to all the learned his UNK from dr. swift himself even down to poet UNK of the UNK STOP

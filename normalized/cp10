START among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from spot drawings for advertising agencies UNK to magazine work and quick UNK jobs STOP 
START each of us had his own UNK besides STOP 
START george did wonderful complicated UNK drawings like something out of a medieval UNK hundreds of delicate details UNK into an UNK sheet and looking as if they had been done under a UNK glass STOP 
START he also drew precise UNK spots which he sold to various literary and artistic UNK the new UNK for instance or UNK STOP 
START i did book UNK and covers for UNK UNK naked girls UNK in corners of UNK furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt UNK UNK a revolver STOP 
START the book could be the brothers UNK but it would still have the same jacket illustration STOP 
START i remember once i did a jacket for UNK press book was a fine historical novel about edward 3 and i did a week of research to get the details just right the UNK UNK UNK clothes STOP 
START i even UNK out the materials from which UNK were made UNK wood covered with leather so i'd get the light UNK accurate STOP 
START UNK the art editor took one look at my finished sketch and said nothing doing UNK STOP 
START in the first place it's static the second place it doesn't look authentic in the third place it would cost a fortune to UNK in the first place you've got six colors there including gold STOP 
START i said mr. UNK it is as authentic as careful research can make it STOP 
START he said that may be but it isn't authentic the way readers think STOP 
START they know from their UNK into television and the movies that UNK in the middle ages had beautiful flowing UNK like little lord UNK and only the UNK had UNK STOP 
START and girls couldn't have dressed like that it isn't transparent enough STOP 
START in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a UNK instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the UNK of a UNK movie STOP 
START UNK was as happy as a UNK STOP 
START that's UNK he said STOP 
START as for donald he actually sold paintings STOP 
START we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as UNK painters with UNK but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it STOP 
START not much sold perhaps three or four a year and usually all to joyce UNK or her friends STOP 
START he had style a real inner vision of his very own STOP 
START it was strange stuff it reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults STOP 
START there was the UNK of color the freedom of perception the lack of UNK but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and UNK you in the eye STOP 
START we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so UNK STOP 
START it may have been true for all i know because his glasses were like the UNK of milk bottles but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting STOP 
START he also had at times an UNK UNK air like a UNK would look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said for christ's sake donald you've got UNK blue all over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint would be all over his UNK as well STOP 
START mrs. UNK thought of him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting STOP 
START it was all UNK and donald didn't need much to live on of us did STOP 
START we shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap UNK of one kind or another STOP 
START attending the life class was my idea or rather UNK idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldn't have gone if i hadn't talked them into it STOP 
START i wanted to paint again STOP 
START i hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year STOP 
START it wasn't just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used even to myself STOP 
START it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of the ambition it UNK in me that kept me from painting STOP 
START i kept saying if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real money get to be well known as an UNK like peter UNK for instance then i could take some time off and paint STOP 
START UNK was a kind of goal i set myself had admired him long before i talked to him STOP 
START it looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession a large and steady income STOP 
START the night we first met at one of mrs. UNK giant parties he was wearing a brown UNK jacket with silver UNK and a soft pink UNK shirt of a UNK he wore a leather UNK drawn through a golden ring in which was set a UNK of pale pure UNK STOP 
START this set his tone UNK of texture and color and another kind of UNK as well for his clothing and UNK would have paid the UNK rent for a year STOP 
START he was fifteen years older than i UNK but full of spring and UNK STOP 
START he didn't look like what i thought of as an old man and his lively and UNK speech made him seem even younger STOP 
START he was one of the most prominent magazine UNK in america saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the UNK national magazines every month STOP 
START life had included him in its modern american artists series and had UNK him at his studio in the east sixties corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have UNK in it painting the UNK of UNK STOP 
START i had a long talk with him STOP 
START we went into mrs. UNK library which had low UNK all along the walls and above them a UNK portrait a jackson UNK twelve feet long and a UNK UNK with a yellow background that looked like an UNK from a UNK tomb STOP 
START the UNK had UNK made for mrs. UNK by picasso himself STOP 
START like certain expensive restaurants just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself STOP 
START in the course of our talk UNK mentioned that he spent part of each week studying STOP 
START by yourself asked STOP 
START no i take classes with different people he said STOP 
START i don't think i've reached the point yet where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft STOP 
START besides it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as UNK went to italy to meet UNK and UNK STOP 
START he made a circle with his UNK and fingers STOP 
START painting isn't this big you know STOP 
START it doesn't embrace only the artist alone before his UNK STOP 
START it is as large as all of art UNK varied UNK STOP 
START he threw his arms wide his face shining STOP 
START the artist is like a UNK of a UNK no he is more than that a UNK UNK in some vast UNK STOP 
START one of these days i'm going to organize a UNK exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days from extreme abstract UNK to extreme UNK and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other STOP 
START the eye is all UNK or UNK STOP 
START ah what a title for the exhibition the eye is all what do you study asked STOP 
START i was UNK listening to him made me feel intelligent STOP 
START i'm studying UNK with burns he replied STOP 
START maybe you know him STOP 
START he teaches at the manhattan school of art STOP 
START i nodded STOP 
START i had studied with burns ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me along with the UNK prize for my paintings of UNK on hudson street STOP 
START burns and i had not loved each other STOP 
START i'm also studying UNK with UNK UNK he went on and twice a week i go to a life class taught by UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK said STOP 
START my god is he still alive must be a million years old STOP 
START i went to a UNK of his work when i was eighteen and i thought he was a contemporary of UNK STOP 
START not quite STOP 
START UNK laughed STOP 
START he's about sixty now STOP 
START still painting still a kind of modern UNK beautiful UNK of mountains and farms STOP 
START he even makes the city look like one of UNK UNK STOP 
START i've always admired him and when i heard he was taking a few pupils i went to him and joined his class STOP 
START yes it sounds great i said but suppose you don't think of yourself as an UNK painter you're missing the point he said STOP 
START he has the magical eye STOP 
START and he is a great man STOP 
START contact with him is UNK STOP 
START and that's the trouble with so many artists today STOP 
START they lack stimulation STOP 
START they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in UNK themselves still farther from life STOP 
START that's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation STOP 
START in the middle ages in the renaissance right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant in the world STOP 
START he was an UNK a man who studied his trade and developed his UNK the way a UNK or a wood UNK did STOP 
START he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning it inside out UNK its wars and its leaders its UNK and its UNK reflecting its profound religious impulses STOP 
START he was a UNK they weren't afraid of the word then UNK nature lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party and of no party STOP 
START but look at us today hold safe little jobs UNK UNK UNK or the UNK incidents in trivial novels and most of our UNK painting is nothing but picking the UNK out of the UNK so it can be UNK in greater purity STOP 
START a bunch of amateur UNK we need is to get back to the group to learning and UNK to the cafe and the school STOP 
START he could certainly talk STOP 
START the UNK of the evening was that i got the address of UNK studio or rather of the studio in which he gave his classes for he didn't work there himself and joined the life class which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning STOP 
START it was an awkward hour but i didn't have to UNK any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job STOP 
START after a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the UNK reading out to work STOP 
START it was mostly for the benefit of the UNK because hardly anybody else ever visited us STOP 
START in a way UNK was right STOP 
START UNK was the word for it STOP 
START i don't know that it was always as UNK as i had expected it to be STOP 
START partly it was because UNK himself wasn't what i anticipated STOP 
START i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead UNK STOP 
START no that isn't quite fair STOP 
START actually there was a lot of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of UNK after a week STOP

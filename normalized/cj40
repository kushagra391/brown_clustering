START in UNK the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the question as always is the prospect for general business activity STOP 
START by and large what happens to business as a whole will UNK the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates STOP 
START moreover the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal UNK and other federal policies which affect interest rates STOP 
START UNK has been a UNK year for UNK of general business activity STOP 
START during much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a UNK UNK but there have been persistent signs of UNK in the economy STOP 
START the tendency for general business activity to UNK somewhat is becoming more evident STOP 
START although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion that the UNK process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer STOP 
START it is difficult to see any powerful sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust STOP 
START the rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be UNK out and facing some decline STOP 
START in earlier business UNK when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp UNK in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain STOP 
START at this time however there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to UNK a sharp rise in residential construction STOP 
START these signs are the inventories of UNK houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in UNK rates for apartments UNK in september STOP 
START on the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course STOP 
START the UNK increase in retail sales in october to a UNK high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference board which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans STOP 
START the pattern of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate UNK through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way STOP 
START the recovery will probably be UNK by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by an expansion of government spending well sustained consumer spending and some UNK of business inventories STOP 
START slight downward pressure what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961 suggests that during the next several months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital funds may be UNK lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower especially the rates on federal state and local bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds STOP 
START however as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great STOP 
START it seems likely moreover that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage UNK institutions interest rates on residential UNK may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although the increased ease in residential mortgage UNK may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate e.g. easier UNK and UNK terms STOP 
START if the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit STOP 
START certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the UNK system STOP 
START however the UNK authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the UNK of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive UNK in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of UNK policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle STOP 
START open market policy one of the most UNK questions is whether the recent UNK of the federal reserve authorities from UNK their open market operations to treasury bills will spread into UNK government UNK in the next few months STOP 
START to the extent that the new administration has its wishes the federal reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of government UNK and UNK seek to force down long-term interest rates STOP 
START the principle of bills only or bills preferably seems so strongly accepted by the federal reserve that it is difficult to UNK conditions which would persuade the authorities to UNK radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term government UNK STOP 
START however to the extent that the UNK authorities in their effort to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market operations in UNK government bonds they will certainly act to UNK any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces STOP 
START by the end of the spring of 1961 assuming that a general business recovery gets under way interest rates should begin to edge upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the UNK authorities move to UNK credit availability STOP 
START my guess would be that interest rates will decline UNK into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the UNK STOP 
START it is pertinent to ask the question has the long UNK of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates answer is in the negative because i believe that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels STOP 
START five basic forces this view is based upon several basic economic forces which i believe will be operating in the sixties as follows 1 recent events in the general assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us and probably UNK for the UNK future STOP 
START this makes it certain that federal expenditures for military UNK and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years STOP 
START we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new african nations against the UNK competition of the communist UNK STOP 
START our efforts to overcome the lead of the russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending STOP 
START moreover it is likely that federal policies aimed at UNK a faster rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas such as education housing medical aid and the like STOP 
START there are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures of which i take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur STOP 
START 2 during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant UNK up in the rate of household UNK which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building STOP 
START according to the latest UNK of the bureau of the census the annual rate of household UNK will increase for the next 20 years STOP 
START under the most favorable assumptions for increase the bureau of the census projects that the annual rate of household UNK will rise from about UNK in the last two years of the fifties to an annual rate of about UNK in the first five years of the sixties and to a slightly higher annual rate of UNK in the second half of the decade STOP 
START during the UNK the UNK show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of UNK in the second half of that decade STOP 
START accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing UNK by the higher rate of household formation should UNK the general economic prospects of the sixties STOP 
START however the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated STOP 
START the average annual rate of UNK in the second half of the sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of UNK in the UNK period from april 1947 to march 1950 STOP 
START 3 with the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated STOP 
START this is an area in which there is still a large UNK of demand STOP 
START state and local expenditures in real terms increased UNK from UNK in 1949 to UNK in 1959 and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of UNK by UNK STOP 
START here would be a powerful force for raising business activity STOP 
START 4 it seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties STOP 
START UNK by keen competition in our industrial system and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade STOP 
START 5 in a more UNK vein about the economic outlook i suspect that the UNK of demand for consumer goods and housing which was UNK during the UNK and world war 2 is finally in the process of running dry STOP 
START there is some UNK evidence of this STOP 
START for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the UNK home loan UNK program seems to have largely exhausted itself STOP 
START indeed the failure of UNK as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing and the increasing reports of pockets of UNK homes and rising UNK rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part that the UNK days of big UNK demand for housing are reaching an end STOP 
START in a way we may be UNK the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more UNK on compact cars free of the UNK which were accepted in the fifties STOP 
START the huge UNK of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war was fed by liquid assets UNK by the public during the war and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields STOP 
START the UNK public has used up a good part of these liquid assets or they have been UNK by the rising price level and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier STOP 
START this is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties STOP 
START i am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties will not be UNK by the great UNK of wants and desires which characterized most of the fifties STOP 
START markets should become more competitive as UNK become more selective STOP 
START UNK capital requirements accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to require enormous amounts of capital funds STOP

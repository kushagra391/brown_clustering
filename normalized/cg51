START UNK pleading her cause must have said that dr. brown was the most distinguished physician in the united states of america for our man poured out his symptoms and drew a UNK waving line indicating the UNK of his UNK STOP 
START he's got high blood pressure too and UNK UNK the doctor said to me STOP 
START transparent look UNK skin could well be UNK STOP 
START he looked UNK at an ash tray piled high with cigarette UNK shook his head and moved his hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture STOP 
START the little official hung his head in shame STOP 
START seeing this his UNK at the next desk gave a short UNK laugh pushed forward his own ash tray innocent of a single butt UNK his chest to show his excellent condition and looked proud STOP 
START the doctor UNK nodded approval STOP 
START at this moment UNK came UNK up to announce that the problem was solved and all UNK had to do was to sign a UNK of papers STOP 
START we went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents and more officials UNK us the rest of the office personnel hot upon our heels STOP 
START by this time word had got around that an american doctor was on the UNK STOP 
START one fellow who had liver spots held out his hands to the great UNK STOP 
START it was funny but it was also touching STOP 
START you know UNK said to me later i am thinking of setting up the UNK UNK STOP 
START i might not make any money but i'd sure have patients STOP 
START after luncheon we took advantage of the UNK period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our dear friend UNK had written STOP 
START UNK is UNK UNK a UNK member of the UNK staff who although born in boston was born there of greek parents STOP 
START several years of her life have been spent in the UNK and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming STOP 
START all you have to do UNK dear is to phone on your arrival STOP 
START they are UNK to see you STOP 
START the wear and tear of life have taught me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign UNK but i planned on being the soul of UNK of giving them plenty of UNK was there the UNK UNK that their cups were already running over without us STOP 
START my diplomacy was needless STOP 
START greek phone service is worse than french so that it was to be some little time before contact of any sort was established STOP 
START in the late afternoon UNK came back to UNK us and we drove to the UNK STOP 
START we stopped first at the UNK that lies at the foot of the height UNK by the UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK are broken UNK tumbled but still in place as are the marble chairs the seats of honor for the legislators STOP 
START the carved UNK of the frieze against the low wall are for the most part UNK but their UNK UNK nude and UNK UNK and the UNK UNK are well preserved in their perfect proportion STOP 
START having completed our camera work we started our climb STOP 
START i suppose the same emotion holds if to a lesser degree with any famous monument STOP 
START will it live up to its reputation weight of fame and history is formidable and UNK steel UNK in UNK do little to UNK interest and imagination STOP 
START UNK UNK we think looking at them so that's the UNK STOP 
START and then perhaps one day we get to UNK STOP 
START we are here come a long way and spent a lot of money STOP 
START it had better be good STOP 
START don't worry about the UNK STOP 
START it is UNK STOP 
START probably every visitor has a favorite time for his first sight of it STOP 
START we saw it frequently afterward but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset STOP 
START the light at that time is a UNK STOP 
START the UNK UNK columns of the UNK UNK in color against the pure deep blue sky frame incredible UNK STOP 
START all we wanted to do was to stand very quietly and look and look and look STOP 
START more than twenty-four hundred years old UNK UNK worn and partially destroyed UNK to an UNK degree UNK and grace it still stands UNK testimony to man's UNK STOP 
START in UNK the UNK who had been in control of the city since the UNK century with a truly UNK lack of UNK used the UNK as a powder magazine STOP 
START it was hit by a shell fired by the UNK UNK army and the great central portion of the temple was UNK to UNK STOP 
START nearby is the temple of UNK STOP 
START the UNK feature the UNK UNK the UNK famous around the world as the porch of the UNK was referred to UNK by UNK as the UNK place STOP 
START another beautiful building is the UNK the entrance gate of the UNK STOP 
START my other UNK of art and UNK knowledge besides remembering that it was UNK who designed the doors of the UNK in UNK is the three styles of greek columns STOP 
START for some happy reason UNK UNK and UNK have always stuck in my mind STOP 
START furthermore i can identify each design STOP 
START it remained however for UNK to teach me that UNK symbolized strength UNK wisdom and UNK beauty the three UNK of the ancient world STOP 
START the columns of the UNK are UNK UNK STOP 
START another classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the UNK UNK in his ballet skirt with great UNK on his shoes who was UNK up and down in front of the palace STOP 
START gun on shoulder he would march UNK for a few yards bring his heels together with a UNK make a UNK UNK UNK UNK and march back to his point of departure STOP 
START we did not dare speak to so UNK a being but UNK aimed his camera and shot him so to speak on the rise the split second between the UNK and the turn STOP 
START the evening of our first day we drove with UNK and UNK UNK who were friends and patients of UNK to UNK at a restaurant on the UNK of the aegean STOP 
START on the way out mr. UNK UNK up a special hill from which one may obtain a UNK view of the UNK lighted by night STOP 
START the great spectacle was a source of UNK and son et UNK which the french were trying to promote with the UNK was the reason STOP 
START these performances were being staged at historical UNK throughout europe STOP 
START by a combination of music lighting effects and UNK famous events that have UNK in these locations are UNK and UNK for large audiences usually to considerable UNK STOP 
START the UNK had been scheduled for the treatment too but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full moon when the UNK themselves out of respect for the natural beauty of the occasion were UNK to UNK their own usual UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK society was split into two UNK the UNK and the artists STOP 
START the artists contended that the UNK gross of soul were all for having son et UNK since the french were UNK the bill and the attraction wherever it had been done had proven popular STOP 
START this was the UNK kind of UNK and they the artists would have no truck with it STOP 
START the UNK was unique in the world and if that UNK work UNK by moonlight wasn't enough for both natives and tourists then they were quite simply UNK and the hell with them STOP 
START it was very UNK STOP 
START the restaurant to which the UNK took us on this night of controversy was the UNK on UNK beach STOP 
START this is a public bathing beach easily UNK by UNK from the center of UNK STOP 
START office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during the UNK period which during the summer UNK from two until five in the afternoon when shops and offices are again open for business STOP 
START they close sometime after eight STOP 
START nine o'clock is the rush hour when the UNK are UNK and by UNK the restaurants are beginning to fill STOP 
START UNK is late for the UNK evenings are delightful and everyone wants to UNK under the stars STOP 
START the sand is fine and pleasant the UNK are clean and the UNK green UNK and butter yellow are very gay STOP 
START although open to the general public it is not UNK atmosphere is that of an attractive private beach club at home STOP 
START we went there a couple of times to swim and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly STOP 
START this agreeable state of affairs is UNK i think on two counts STOP 
START one is greece is not yet suffering from UNK STOP 
START the public may still find pleasure in public places STOP 
START the other is that the charge for UNK and UNK though modest from an american point of view still is a little high for many UNK STOP 
START we were struck by the notable absence of UNK UNK and beer UNK but just so that we wouldn't go UNK on greek UNK perfection was UNK by a couple of UNK portable UNK STOP 
START greek boys and girls also go for UNK and the stations most UNK to are those carrying united states overseas programs STOP 
START a good deal of english was spoken on the beach most educated UNK learn it in childhood and there were also american wives and children of our overseas UNK STOP 
START for a delightful drive out of UNK i should recommend UNK at the end of the attic UNK STOP 
START the road a comparatively new one is very good UNK along UNK UNK and UNK of deep and brilliant blue STOP 
START i suppose the day will inevitably come when the area will be UNK with developments but at present it is deserted and UNK STOP 
START three beneficial UNK to progress are the lack of water electricity and UNK STOP 
START at UNK there is a group of beautiful columns the UNK of a temple to UNK of particular interest at that time as active reconstruction was in progress STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK the UNK and on the ground UNK of columns two and a half to three feet in thickness were being fitted with sections UNK UNK to match exactly the UNK and proportion of the original STOP 
START later they would be UNK into place STOP 
START there is a UNK restaurant at UNK and i fed a thin little UNK cat and gave it two UNK of water there was no milk which it UNK up as though it were UNK STOP 
START i think its UNK had never been UNK before STOP 
START UNK and i UNK one night in a UNK restaurant in UNK right on the UNK edge STOP 
START to enter it you go down five or six steps from the road STOP 
START across the road is the kitchen and UNK bearing great UNK of dishes dodge traffic as UNK as their french colleagues at the restaurant in the place du UNK in paris STOP 
START this restaurant too had a cat a dusty thin little creature STOP 
START how can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant this one was STOP 
START when offered a UNK it glanced right and left and UNK obviously frightened and expecting a kick but too hungry not to UNK the UNK STOP 
START greece was one of the UNK of our trip but beginning in greece and continuing around the world throughout southeast asia the treatment of animals was UNK ranging from UNK indifference to active cruelty STOP 
START this of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated people we met who loved their UNK but UNK is not a basic human instinct STOP 
START we met some charming UNK and among them our UNK UNK UNK high STOP 
START his english was limited and the little he knew he found UNK STOP 
START a particularly UNK phrase was UNK UNK we have time at our disposal STOP 
START this he claimed was the favorite UNK of the english STOP 
START they would be UNK under a tree UNK UNK UNK the UNK life UNK him that the day was yet young STOP

START he put in a call to UNK from his hotel room STOP 
START the maid answered and he decided UNK must be at work STOP 
START UNK UNK him not to be too hopeful and then UNK his own advice said UNK but it does sound good STOP 
START a woman named UNK who tells nobody anything about herself STOP 
START that UNK picture with the same UNK STOP 
START i'm not exactly UNK up and down with enthusiasm STOP 
START i'll call you in a day or so STOP 
START on the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over lake UNK and along the coast STOP 
START gulf springs was ten miles UNK more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made UNK by tourist UNK STOP 
START he checked into a motel and drove downtown STOP 
START the UNK was a UNK building UNK the customary dome STOP 
START instead of the usual UNK UNK UNK and UNK of bare dirt in most UNK squares the building was UNK in by a UNK growth of UNK and UNK and a smooth lawn the UNK UNK shade of UNK grass STOP 
START he figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff STOP 
START a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff UNK a big UNK man with thick white hair and a voice with a UNK resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office STOP 
START seated in front of the desk hank said i'm looking for some information with very little to go on sheriff STOP 
START he explained the background of the case ending with the UNK clue which had brought him to gulf springs STOP 
START the UNK UNK chair tilted back STOP 
START so you're looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been UNK STOP 
START if there was such a person i'm afraid she got away with it STOP 
START pity we don't know more about him STOP 
START i think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the UNK match with the UNK a little later STOP 
START it'll be a UNK job but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county UNK office STOP 
START maybe the society editor would remember a UNK UNK bride STOP 
START that's an idea STOP 
START mrs. UNK has been society editor here for twenty-five years STOP 
START the editor says that marriages may be made in heaven but UNK are made in mrs. UNK columns STOP 
START she's the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday paper and all that STOP 
START he smiled STOP 
START once when the editor was just out of the hospital from a UNK operation mrs. UNK and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed STOP 
START she'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background STOP 
START she'd have made a great scientist dedicated to UNK down UNK and environment STOP 
START she'd also remember if the UNK died later STOP 
START he stood up STOP 
START i wish you good luck but please don't UNK up too tough a case for me this close to election STOP 
START if you find out anything come on back here and we'll get started on it STOP 
START UNK down mrs. UNK was like trying to catch up with paul UNK between UNK and UNK STOP 
START it turned out that she also sold real estate UNK and hospital insurance STOP 
START the UNK UNK stretched into the afternoon from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found her at five o'clock STOP 
START she was a large woman with a UNK gray UNK cut and a pencil UNK like a bit between her teeth while she UNK and UNK on an old UNK STOP 
START it took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted STOP 
START last year i do remember one STOP 
START from UNK UNK STOP 
START married a man named vincent black STOP 
START i remember her because she didn't want her picture in the paper STOP 
START first bride like that i've seen in twenty-five years STOP 
START what reason did she give said she had a UNK on her face some sort of UNK and none of her old pictures was good enough STOP 
START i didn't see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked like it had never had a UNK on it STOP 
START but of course you couldn't see too well through the UNK STOP 
START was her name UNK UNK now how in hell would i remember that never mind STOP 
START i can look it up STOP 
START do they still live here i think they moved away shortly after they were married STOP 
START he was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred STOP 
START i'm sure it'll be in the files STOP 
START we usually run a social note when somebody moves away STOP 
START he stood up and UNK her STOP 
START have they inherited some money or something asked with a UNK UNK in her eye STOP 
START he said vaguely well it is a little legal matter but nothing like that STOP 
START he hurried across to the UNK and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving STOP 
START sounds like what you're after he said when hank had finished STOP 
START come on let's hurry down before they lock up for the day STOP 
START in the basement the sheriff took him to a small UNK office occupied by a tall thin man informal in UNK shirt UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK UNK UNK chairman of the board of UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK is a private detective UNK STOP 
START wants to look up something in the newspaper files so don't lock him in here STOP 
START sure said UNK STOP 
START i'll just leave the door open STOP 
START it UNK when you close it so stay as long as you like STOP 
START UNK crossed the room to a metal door with an open UNK in the top half STOP 
START he pulled it open STOP 
START now don't shut this door STOP 
START it won't open from inside STOP 
START before we built the new jail we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded STOP 
START UNK treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners STOP 
START they were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from UNK air conditioner coming through the UNK STOP 
START he walked past the sheriff into a UNK room with UNK full of big UNK volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls STOP 
START a metal table and four chairs stood in the center STOP 
START they're all here back to UNK UNK told him STOP 
START it's all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave STOP 
START and of course you know not to take UNK STOP 
START i'll leave the air conditioner on for you mr. UNK said UNK STOP 
START don't forget to turn it off and close the door good so it'll UNK STOP 
START hank UNK them and promised to observe the rules STOP 
START when they had gone he stood for a minute breathing in the UNK of old paper and leather which the UNK UNK air conditioner couldn't quite UNK STOP 
START chapter fourteen in a tour around the UNK he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed UNK around the room STOP 
START an old weakness for UNK in records rose up to UNK him STOP 
START it was indeed all here almost a century STOP 
START from reconstruction to moon rockets STOP 
START but he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones STOP 
START last year's volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling STOP 
START near it was a metal ladder on UNK attached to the top shelf STOP 
START he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it STOP 
START he staggered over and dropped it on the table STOP 
START since mrs. UNK remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started to UNK through several months STOP 
START he tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept UNK up to UNK him STOP 
START at last he found it in the paper of april 2 STOP 
START it told him little more than mrs. UNK had remembered stating that it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others STOP 
START there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK life was an open book so to speak from his birth in jackson mississippi through his UNK days at UNK and his UNK of a UNK degree which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for UNK business machines STOP 
START the one line on the bride said she was miss UNK UNK from UNK UNK STOP 
START no mention of new orleans STOP 
START hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for mr. black STOP 
START if mrs. black was who he thought she was mr. UNK UNK selling days might well be over STOP 
START now for their UNK from gulf springs STOP 
START this time the search took twice as long cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several columns of UNK and UNK social notes in each issue STOP 
START he found it in the edition of may 15 STOP 
START the item said mr. and mrs. black had moved to jackson his home town so the lovely UNK had been with him a year ago STOP 
START next on his program was a call to the jackson office of UNK business machines to find out if vincent black was still with them or more specifically still with us STOP 
START he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided to UNK his weakness now STOP 
START for the next hour he UNK happily up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen UNK UNK the UNK theater fire in chicago and the UNK trial STOP 
START in the middle of the stock market crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office STOP 
START he turned around saw nothing and decided it must be a UNK STOP 
START something else UNK him yet there was no sound only UNK silence STOP 
START then he knew it was not sound but lack of it STOP 
START the air conditioner was no longer running STOP 
START he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing STOP 
START it UNK shut as he sprang toward it STOP 
START he pressed his face against the UNK STOP 
START who's there light shining through the UNK dimly UNK the office beyond enough for him to see there was no one there STOP 
START then he heard the outer door closing STOP 
START hey come back he shouted STOP 
START he thought it must be some damn UNK or cleaning woman UNK around UNK that UNK had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock up STOP 
START then the faint UNK of fear stirred in his mind STOP 
START unless he was UNK the person UNK just left couldn't have missed seeing hank through the open door of the UNK lighted room STOP 
START and even if he'd somehow missed seeing him he wouldn't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room STOP 
START whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited till the UNK and square were deserted STOP 
START but why search his room at the motel come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left they could kill him just as easy right now STOP 
START nobody could hear what was going on in this underground UNK STOP 
START then he heard it and smelled it the steady UNK the UNK familiar UNK of gas UNK STOP 
START it must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the UNK office STOP 
START until now UNK UNK and UNK UNK had been like an UNK which he could UNK at his own pace and choosing STOP 
START except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality STOP 
START UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK had UNK him into thinking of UNK and UNK separately or together as a legend STOP 
START they kept drifting apart and UNK again in his mind like some minute form of life on a UNK slide STOP

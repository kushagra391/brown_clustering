START in the final accounting these would have UNK the bill for both sides STOP 
START an estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive STOP 
START yet the huge amount of money consumed by the selden litigation which many regarded as UNK indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure STOP 
START the duration and other circumstances of the selden case made it a UNK example of the gross UNK of patent UNK actions STOP 
START the suit as we have seen came before the courts when patent UNK UNK and UNK were making mounting demands for reforms in the american patent system STOP 
START chief among the defects they UNK out were the complicated and UNK procedures in UNK STOP 
START in a long and angry UNK to his opinion judge UNK had UNK the weight of judicial UNK to such criticism STOP 
START it is a duty said UNK not to let pass this opportunity of UNK against the methods of taking and printing testimony in UNK current in this circuit and probably others UNK if not justified by the rules of the supreme court especially to be found in patent causes and UNK UNK in this litigation STOP 
START as long as the bar UNK to UNK evidence by written UNK rather than UNK UNK before an UNK judicial officer i fear that the UNK rules will remain UNK and expensive UNK remain the best known characteristic of UNK STOP 
START observing that reforms sometimes begin with the UNK of horrible examples UNK UNK the many UNK encouraged by existing procedures STOP 
START he cited the UNK dimensions of the selden case record UNK of testimony and exhibits numerous UNK over minor matters objections stated at UNK length the frequent and UNK verbal UNK UNK for and UNK from the UNK UNK to the lie direct STOP 
START the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case was a striking though not singular example concluded UNK will remain as long as testimony is taken without any UNK judicial officer present and responsible for the maintenance of discipline and the reception or UNK of testimony STOP 
START not least among the members of the patent bar who UNK this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the selden suit STOP 
START william a. UNK asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years STOP 
START UNK joined lawyers in the UNK for reform inevitably UNK upon the selden litigation as a horrible example STOP 
START its UNK UNK were UNK to those of the british courts of UNK UNK UNK by dickens in UNK house STOP 
START parker who agreed with much of this criticism did not UNK his UNK with UNK defects STOP 
START but he felt that the selden case was being UNK UNK STOP 
START in a detailed letter published in the scientific american in 1912 he remarked that loose statements about the case showed UNK understanding of the facts STOP 
START the suit although commonly designated as a single action actually UNK five cases STOP 
START parker insisted that the size of the record would have been UNK reduced but for an UNK UNK of testimony STOP 
START in a private communication written in UNK parker had been more to the point STOP 
START noting the UNK of UNK and members of the patent bar he admitted that some of the UNK were fairly well founded but he added that under existing rules the courts could not UNK testimony in a group of suits involving separate UNK of the same patent STOP 
START the vast industrial interests caught up in the selden suit as well as the complex character of the UNK art encouraged both sides to UNK every possible chance for or against the patent said parker STOP 
START this very seldom happens in this class or in other cases and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur STOP 
START parker listed the UNK he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony STOP 
START the most important of these found him in agreement with UNK plea for reform STOP 
START parker called for UNK of the UNK or UNK right of taking UNK before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony STOP 
START the taking of UNK he suggested should be placed under a special court examiner UNK to UNK UNK and relevant answers and to UNK UNK testimony STOP 
START i am satisfied that in the selden case had this power existed and this course been pursued it would have UNK the UNK of some of the experts nearly UNK and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that STOP 
START in the end UNK UNK protest which parker called the now somewhat famous note on this selden case did not go UNK STOP 
START in 1912 the united states supreme court adopted a new set of rules of UNK which became effective on february 1 1913 STOP 
START the revised procedure was UNK as a UNK reform STOP 
START under the new rules testimony is taken UNK in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character STOP 
START other UNK methods are designed to prevent UNK limit UNK and reduce the expense of UNK suits STOP 
START one of the a.l.a.m. lawyers observed that if the selden case had been tried under this UNK procedure the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone could have been contained in one volume STOP 
START while patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation these rules have saved UNK UNK sums of money STOP 
START there is little doubt that they were UNK by the supreme court as a direct result of the selden patent suit STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START UNK before it was formally dissolved in 1912 the a.l.a.m. was succeeded by the automobile board of trade the direct UNK UNK of the present-day automobile manufacturers association STOP 
START the trade bodies which came in the wake of the a.l.a.m. were more representative for they never adopted a policy of UNK STOP 
START nevertheless it is from the selden organization that the industry inherited its UNK machinery for UNK the broader interests of the trade STOP 
START one of the chief features of this community of interest is the UNK patents UNK agreement a UNK in the development of american industrial cooperation STOP 
START its origin lies in the selden patent controversy and its UNK STOP 
START from the earliest days of the motor car industry before the a.l.a.m. was established patent UNK UNK as a serious and UNK problem STOP 
START many patent UNK were UNK over automobile components and UNK among them tires UNK UNK ball UNK license UNK and electric UNK STOP 
START the UNK and momentum of the young industry UNK a general UNK of patent claims STOP 
START as early as 1900 a wall street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of UNK heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers STOP 
START this scheme failed and the following decade brought a UNK of UNK suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912 STOP 
START in this UNK of UNK claims the UNK scheme adopted by the a.l.a.m. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or UNK the UNK of UNK litigation STOP 
START the UNK of shop UNK for a nominal UNK eliminated UNK suits among the members of the a.l.a.m. patent pool although it did not protect them against outside actions and kept open channels for the UNK of UNK technology STOP 
START one of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the UNK of patent rights among a.l.a.m. members STOP 
START within its limits this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a UNK agreement STOP 
START its positive features UNK the fact that the pool was an UNK of a UNK monopoly STOP 
START since the a.l.a.m. UNK UNK only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents the denial of rights to independent companies did not UNK technical progress in UNK UNK of the industry STOP 
START the highly important UNK patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the a.l.a.m. pool STOP 
START but henry ford used the planetary transmission in his model t and earlier cars and in UNK as a UNK measure took out a license from the man who claimed to be its UNK STOP 
START for those UNK with it the a.l.a.m. pool was a haven from the UNK actions involving detail patents that UNK the industry with mounting intensity after 1900 STOP 
START by 1910 the courts were crowded with cases many of them brought by UNK who UNK in UNK UNK STOP 
START it was commonplace for auto makers UNK and dealers to find warning UNK and threats of UNK suits in their daily mail STOP 
START purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the UNK view commented a trade journal the matter of patents in the automobile and UNK trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business instead of simple UNK protection devices for encouraging UNK creation STOP 
START occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal UNK STOP 
START one manufacturer who held an UNK basic patent said i would readily put over UNK into the manufacture of the device but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged UNK of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits STOP 
START the prevailing view in the industry was UNK up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a senate committee the UNK UNK and UNK expensive conditions including UNK surrounding legal UNK particularly in patent litigation are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste STOP 
START by that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was UNK constructive achievement and UNK the free exchange of technical information STOP 
START at this point charles c. UNK long an advocate of patent peace in the industry became chairman of the patents committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce successor to the automobile board of trade STOP 
START UNK was treasurer of the UNK UNK company an UNK firm which had manufactured UNK machinery before producing the UNK car in UNK STOP 
START he had UNK knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the UNK STOP 
START anxious to avoid a similar UNK in the motor car industry UNK went to detroit in UNK to UNK the support of leading a.l.a.m. members for an UNK UNK plan STOP 
START the UNK created by the selden patent UNK his proposal but UNK did not abandon his scheme STOP 
START after the UNK of the a.l.a.m. the time was UNK for establishing such a pool STOP 
START most manufacturers were now disposed to UNK a proposal for the formal UNK of patents STOP 
START it is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned said a trade authority than to continue the costly effort of UNK the UNK in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day STOP 
START with the other members of the patents committee UNK c. UNK howard e. UNK UNK t. white and w. h. UNK UNK UNK a UNK agreement whose essential feature of UNK UNK was his own contribution STOP 
START the plan was supported by frederick p. fish counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce STOP 
START it will be recalled that in his UNK for the a.l.a.m. before judge UNK fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the american industrial community STOP 
START he was well aware that some UNK and their allies used their patents solely for UNK value STOP 
START my personal view is that not one UNK invention in ten is worth making he later told a congressional committee STOP 
START the eloquent UNK of fish guaranteed the UNK of the plan by the members of the UNK trade association STOP 
START drawn up in UNK the UNK agreement became effective in UNK STOP 
START it remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at UNK intervals since UNK STOP

START for here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to UNK UNK and UNK some of its former UNK to the UNK image of the species man or as malraux himself puts it to make men conscious of the UNK they ignore in themselves STOP 
START 1 UNK UNK the walnut trees of UNK was written in the early years of the second world war during a period of enforced leisure when he was taken UNK by the germans after the fall of france STOP 
START the UNK presumably after being UNK out of the country was published in switzerland in 1943 STOP 
START the work as it stands is not the entire book that malraux wrote at that time it is only the first section of a UNK novel called la UNK UNK UNK this first section was somehow preserved there are always these UNK little UNK about the actual facts of UNK life when the UNK destroyed the rest STOP 
START if we are to believe the list of titles printed in UNK latest book la UNK UNK UNK UNK 1 1957 he is still engaged in writing a large novel under his original title STOP 
START but as he remarks in his UNK to the walnut trees a novel can hardly ever be UNK and when this one appears in its final form the form of the first part will no doubt be radically changed STOP 
START malraux UNK perhaps with a UNK too UNK a UNK that his UNK work will accordingly appeal only to the curiosity of UNK and to UNK of what might have been STOP 
START even in its present form however the first part of UNK UNK novel is among the greatest works of UNK century literature it should be far better known than it is STOP 
START the theme of the walnut trees of UNK is most closely related to its immediate UNK in UNK array of novels man's hope UNK STOP 
START this magnificent but greatly UNK book which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time as no other comparable creation has suffered severely from having been written about an historical event the spanish civil war that is still capable of UNK the UNK fires of old political UNK STOP 
START even so apparently UNK a critic as w. h. UNK has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece of UNK propaganda has then gone on to argue with UNK consistency that all the obviously UNK aspects of the book are simply UNK UNK STOP 
START nothing however could be farther from the truth STOP 
START the whole purpose of man's hope is to UNK the tragic UNK between means and ends inherent in all organized political violence and even when such violence is a necessary and legitimate UNK of liberty justice and human dignity STOP 
START nowhere before in UNK pages have we met such UNK UNK of a quality of man which UNK the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether both the action of UNK early UNK like UNK and UNK and the UNK action of dedicated communists like UNK UNK and UNK in man's fate STOP 
START man UNK only a small part of himself in an action says old UNK the UNK and the more the action claims to be total the smaller is the part of man engaged STOP 
START these lines never cease to UNK the book UNK all the UNK of combat and to make an appeal for a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the UNK necessities of war STOP 
START it is this larger theme of the quality of man a quality that UNK the ideological and UNK into the human which now forms the UNK heart of UNK artistic universe STOP 
START malraux to be sure does not abandon the world of violence combat and sudden death which has become his UNK as a creative artist and which is the only world apparently in which his imagination can flame into life STOP 
START the walnut trees of UNK includes not one war but two and UNK in a turkish revolution along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure STOP 
START but while war still serves as a UNK for the values that malraux wishes to express these values are no longer linked with the triumph or defeat of any cause whether that of an individual UNK of the UNK or a collective attempt to escape from the UNK of UNK as their necessary condition STOP 
START on the contrary the UNK and UNK of combat is only the UNK foil against which the sudden UNK of the human flash forth with the UNK UNK of a UNK STOP 
START 2 the walnut trees of UNK is composed in the form of a UNK with the two small side panels UNK and UNK the main central episode of the novel STOP 
START this central episode consists of a series of UNK scenes set in the period from the beginning of the present century up to the first world war STOP 
START the UNK scenes on the other hand both take place in the late spring of 1940 just at the moment of the defeat of france in the second great world conflict STOP 
START the narrator is an UNK serving with the french army and he has the same name berger that malraux himself was later to use in the resistance malraux he was also serving in the tank corps before being captured and we learn as well that in civilian life he had been a writer STOP 
START these UNK UNK are obvious and far too much time has been spent UNK on their possible implications STOP 
START much more important is to grasp the feelings of the narrator whose full name is never given as he becomes aware of the UNK and UNK mass of french prisoners UNK together in a temporary prison camp in and around the UNK of UNK STOP 
START for as his UNK gradually UNK back into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity as they lose all the UNK of their acquired culture he is overcome by the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind STOP 
START as a writer by what have i been UNK these last ten years if not by mankind i am face to face with the UNK stuff STOP 
START the intuition about mankind UNK in these opening pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of the text we must attend to it more closely than has usually been done STOP 
START what does the narrator see and what does he feel good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the UNK determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the wind STOP 
START UNK and UNK in stiff UNK phrases the soldiers continue to bridge the distance between themselves and those they love UNK struggle to keep open a road to the future in their hearts STOP 
START and by a UNK and UNK use of UNK the UNK is called a UNK stockade the hastily erected UNK is a UNK UNK the men begin to look like UNK UNK and to acquire UNK faces malraux projects a UNK of human endurance which is also the endurance of the human stretching backward into the dark UNK of time STOP 
START the narrator feels himself UNK a glimpse of UNK learning of man's UNK familiarity with UNK as well as his equally UNK UNK his secret faith in endurance however UNK with UNK the same faith perhaps as the UNK used to have in the face of UNK STOP 
START this new vision of man that the narrator UNK is also accompanied by a UNK of his previous view STOP 
START i thought i knew more than my education had taught me notes the narrator because i had encountered the UNK UNK of a political or religious faith STOP 
START is this not malraux himself UNK to his own earlier UNK with the ideological now he knows that an intellectual is not only a man to whom books are necessary he is any man whose reasoning however elementary it may be affects and UNK his life STOP 
START from this point of view the UNK UNK of the past stirred into action by one ideology or another were all composed of intellectuals and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be discovered STOP 
START the men around him UNK the narrator have been living from day to day for thousands of years STOP 
START the human is deeper than a mass ideology certainly deeper than the isolated individual the narrator recalls the words of his father vincent berger it is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one finally comes down to mankind STOP 
START the entire middle section of the walnut trees is taken up with the life of vincent berger himself whose UNK notes on his UNK with mankind are now UNK by his son STOP 
START he was not much older than myself writes the narrator when he began to feel the impact of that human mystery which now UNK me and which makes me begin perhaps to understand him STOP 
START for the figure of vincent berger malraux has obviously drawn on his studies of t. e. lawrence though berger UNK on the side of the UNK instead of against them and like both lawrence and malraux himself he is a UNK UNK of UNK STOP 
START a professor at the university of UNK where his first course of lectures was on UNK and the philosophy of action vincent berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the german embassy in UNK STOP 
START as an UNK before the first world war he was of course of german UNK he quickly involves himself in the young UNK revolutionary movement to such an extent that his own country begins to doubt his UNK STOP 
START and after becoming the UNK man of UNK UNK he is sent by the latter to UNK the way for a new turkish empire UNK the union of all UNK throughout central asia from UNK to the chinese UNK on the silk trade route STOP 
START vincent UNK mission is a failure because the UNK nationalism on which UNK UNK counted does not exist STOP 
START central asia is UNK in a UNK from which nothing can UNK it amid a dusty UNK in which nothing human any longer seemed to survive vincent berger begins to dream of the UNK STOP 
START oh for the green of europe UNK in the night the UNK and UNK of UNK STOP 
START finally after almost being beaten to death by a UNK he could not fight back because UNK are sacred to UNK he UNK up his mission and returns to europe STOP 
START this has been his first encounter with mankind and although he has now become a UNK figure in the popular european press it leaves him UNK UNK STOP 
START despite UNK report UNK UNK UNK to surrender his dream of a turkish blood alliance vincent berger UNK that political ambition is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men STOP 
START but as he UNK shortly on returning among intellectuals UNK by le UNK du UNK his experience of action had also taught him a more positive lesson STOP 
START for six years my father had had to do too much commanding and convincing writes the narrator not to understand that man begins with the other STOP 
START and when vincent berger returns to europe this first result of his UNK with mankind is considerably UNK and UNK by a crucial revelation STOP 
START for a UNK sense of UNK occurs in consequence of two events which as so often in malraux suddenly UNK a character with the UNK question of the nature and value of human life STOP 
START one such event is the landing in europe itself when the UNK familiarity and UNK of the UNK after the blank UNK of asia UNK the returning UNK into a realization of the infinite possibilities of human life STOP

START some of the new york UNK musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning UNK themselves free from snow STOP 
START a tiny handful never did make the concert STOP 
START but after a UNK delay the substantially complete UNK assembled on stage for the UNK proceedings STOP 
START they faced a rather small audience as quite a few UNK apparently had decided to UNK the UNK of the afternoon STOP 
START it was an excellent concert STOP 
START paul UNK UNK out his current UNK with the orchestra is a solid musician and the UNK plays for him STOP 
START their collaboration in the beethoven second symphony was UNK intelligent and natural UNK STOP 
START it was not a heavy UNK beethoven STOP 
START the music sang UNK UNK UNK when necessary was properly UNK and balanced STOP 
START the UNK UNK poem UNK is a UNK UNK affair that was pleasant to encounter once again STOP 
START fortunate for the music itself it is not too frequent a visitor it were its heavily UNK UNK would soon become UNK STOP 
START mr. UNK UNK the temptation to UNK the UNK elements of the score STOP 
START he did not let the strings for instance weep UNK or get UNK STOP 
START his interpretation was a model of UNK and accuracy STOP 
START and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto with UNK UNK as UNK he was an UNK partner STOP 
START mr. UNK approach to the concerto was bold sweeping and UNK UNK STOP 
START he swept through the music with ease in a UNK and UNK manner STOP 
START an impressive UNK mr. UNK has fine rhythm to boot STOP 
START his tone is the UNK part of his equipment tends to be hard and UNK STOP 
START a school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs STOP 
START it is after all a UNK work even with the big UNK melody of the second movement the composer himself was called the age of steel pianist STOP 
START but granted all this one still would have liked to have heard a little more UNK UNK than mr. UNK supplied STOP 
START taken as a whole though it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra STOP 
START mr. UNK fully deserved the warm reception he received STOP 
START a new work on the program was UNK UNK festival UNK receiving its first new york hearing STOP 
START this was composed last year as a UNK to the automobile industry STOP 
START it is not program music though STOP 
START it runs a little more than ten minutes is UNK busy UNK and UNK STOP 
START la UNK like it or not is a UNK opera STOP 
START and so of course it is a UNK opera as well STOP 
START snow or no the fans were present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the UNK work STOP 
START so the plot UNK the sets are UNK the costumes are UNK the orchestra was UNK and not very well connected with what the singers were doing STOP 
START after all the opera has UNK music to sing and the UNK are well distributed with no less than six leading parts STOP 
START one of those parts is that of evil evil UNK the UNK STOP 
START his UNK UNK were carried on by UNK UNK who was taking the part for the first time with the company STOP 
START he has the UNK and the stage presence for a UNK UNK and he sang with character and strong tone STOP 
START what was lacking was a real sense of phrase the kind of UNK singing that would have added a dimension of UNK to what is after all a very UNK character STOP 
START UNK UNK as laura and UNK UNK as UNK also were new to the cast but only with respect to this season have both sung these parts here before STOP 
START laura is a good role for miss UNK and she gave it force dramatic color and passion STOP 
START mr. UNK was as always a UNK actor a few telling strokes he characterized UNK UNK STOP 
START part of this UNK was of course accomplished with the vocal UNK STOP 
START his singing was strong and musical his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality STOP 
START eileen UNK in the title role UNK UNK as la UNK and richard UNK as UNK were UNK from earlier performances this season and all contributed to a vigorous performance STOP 
START if only they and UNK UNK in the pit had got together a bit more STOP 
START UNK birds sing UNK UNK the poet and no better description of the UNK of the UNK UNK could be imagined STOP 
START their UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK is a good sample of the special elegant art of english UNK singing STOP 
START it also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of italian and english UNK plus several french UNK STOP 
START the english have managed to hold onto their UNK tradition better than anyone else STOP 
START the original impulses came to england late in the sixteenth century and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque UNK UNK UNK UNK and the like STOP 
START even after UNK traditions were UNK by the UNK UNK the practice of singing together UNK UNK and UNK always UNK STOP 
START the english never again developed a strong native music that could UNK the UNK of an earlier great age the way say the opera in italy UNK out the italian UNK STOP 
START early interest UNK interest in UNK singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead of similar UNK in other countries STOP 
START as a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the english UNK STOP 
START naturally mr. UNK and the other singers in his UNK are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their UNK william UNK thomas UNK and thomas UNK STOP 
START there is an almost instrumental quality to their singing with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture STOP 
START both techniques give the music purity and clarity STOP 
START claude UNK vocal description of a battle the french UNK of UNK UNK and UNK are very UNK is lots of fun and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other UNK by UNK and UNK STOP 
START only with the more UNK intense and baroque expressions of UNK UNK and UNK does the singing seem a little UNK STOP 
START nevertheless the UNK accuracy and infectious charm of these performances UNK UNK make it an attractive UNK at the period STOP 
START the works are presented UNK STOP 
START UNK and UNK are provided STOP 
START UNK and color the elements of UNK and color in UNK are strong french characteristics STOP 
START baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tends to be strong lively intense controlled and quite abstract STOP 
START in france it remained always more UNK more UNK more full of flavor STOP 
START UNK and UNK gave titles to nearly everything they wrote not in the later sense of program music but as a kind of UNK reference for the close clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise UNK STOP 
START both composers turn up on new imports from france STOP 
START UNK is the unlikely name of a french recording company whose full label is UNK de la UNK a UNK STOP 
START they UNK in UNK items and old french music naturally UNK a good deal of their attention STOP 
START UNK et concerts UNK of UNK le grand occupy two UNK UNK and UNK and reveal the UNK taste and UNK of this master delicate flexible and UNK STOP 
START the concerts UNK 2 6 9 10 and 14 are represented are really closer to chamber UNK than to UNK in the italian sense STOP 
START the UNK la UNK la UNK UNK and UNK are often more UNK worked out and in fact show a strong italian influence STOP 
START UNK also turns up along with some UNK UNK on a disk called UNK UNK du UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK still is remembered a bit but UNK de UNK UNK and UNK are hardly household words STOP 
START what is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of french music that was moving toward the UNK STOP 
START the UNK la UNK with its battle music UNK wit and UNK simplicity already UNK off UNK and points towards the UNK UNK that ended the baroque era STOP 
START if UNK shows the fashionable trend the others do so all the more STOP 
START all these records have close attractive sound and the performances by a variety of UNK is characteristic STOP 
START UNK six concerts UNK UNK recorded by UNK de UNK pierre UNK UNK UNK UNK turn out to be UNK pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself STOP 
START the strange delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes UNK titles are still UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK UNK et UNK UNK contains music by UNK UNK UNK and UNK well performed by the ensemble instrumental UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK music a lot of it was played in UNK UNK hall on saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as globe concert arts STOP 
START works by j. c. UNK UNK craft joseph UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and j. g. UNK were performed by seven UNK including UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and robert UNK pianist and UNK STOP 
START since UNK music tends to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather UNK to UNK ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and UNK of composers from beethoven to UNK STOP 
START thus there was really an excess of UNK charm as one of these UNK pieces followed another on saturday night STOP 
START each might find a useful place in a varied musical program but taken together they grew quite UNK STOP 
START the performances were variable those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying some by UNK UNK rather trying STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK and frederick UNK UNK presented a program of UNK entitled east meets west in UNK UNK hall last night STOP 
START they were accompanied by UNK UNK lee pianist STOP 
START selections from fifteen countries were sung as UNK and UNK in a broad range of languages STOP 
START songs from china and japan were reserved exclusively for miss UNK who is a native of china and those of the british UNK were sung by mr. UNK who is english by birth STOP 
START this was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles STOP 
START on the contrary miss UNK and mr. UNK chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START there was therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise STOP 
START the performances were assured UNK and UNK informal STOP 
START what was omitted from a neglected education were those UNK known as the facts of life STOP 
START UNK little UNK UNK presented yesterday afternoon at town hall is a UNK precious little piece very french not without wit and charm STOP 
START the poor UNK UNK a certain UNK de UNK has his problems in getting the necessary information STOP 
START the humor of the situation can be imagined STOP 
START it all takes place in the eighteenth century STOP 
START what a silly artificial way of life UNK and his UNK UNK STOP 
START but they wish they could bring it back STOP 
START UNK delightful music stands just at the point where the classical UNK tradition handed down to UNK largely in the form of UNK and UNK music becomes virtually UNK STOP 
START the musical UNK and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a UNK little joke from becoming either UNK or UNK STOP 
START the simple clever production was also able to UNK the thin line between those UNK STOP 
START arlene UNK was charming as poor UNK STOP 
START yes arlene is her name work uses the old UNK tradition of giving the part of a young UNK youth to a UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK was delightful as the young wife and john UNK was amusing as the UNK who failed to do all his UNK STOP 
START the work was presented as the final event in the town hall festival of music STOP 
START it was UNK with a UNK UNK opera the poor UNK set to a UNK by jean UNK a kind of grand UNK by the sea a UNK returns UNK and gets done in by his wife STOP 
START with the exception of a few spots UNK music mostly UNK away with his usual collection of UNK odd UNK and UNK UNK UNK STOP

START UNK STOP 
START only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience STOP 
START ring of bright water by gavin maxwell is just that a UNK UNK personal UNK of a man an UNK and a remote cottage in the UNK west UNK STOP 
START he has married me with a ring of bright water begins the UNK UNK poem from which maxwell takes his title and it is this UNK bond between the human and natural world that the author UNK STOP 
START the place is UNK the site of a UNK UNK opposite the UNK of UNK STOP 
START it is a land of long UNK few people a UNK road miles away and of wild UNK UNK UNK wild UNK UNK and UNK playing in the waters STOP 
START how maxwell UNK his first coming to UNK his UNK the empty house with UNK the subtle changes in season over ten years is a moving experience STOP 
START just the UNK of time and place of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost would be enough STOP 
START but it isn't STOP 
START there is UNK an UNK who UNK with maxwell and gave UNK name to a new species from the UNK UNK to his london flat STOP 
START it may sound UNK to say that there has never been a more UNK animal in all literature STOP 
START this is not only a UNK to UNK of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book but to the author who has UNK the UNK of a frightened UNK UNK journey by plane from UNK to london then by train where he lay curled in the wash UNK playing with the water tap to UNK with UNK detail STOP 
START UNK as his owner was soon to learn had strange UNK habits STOP 
START he liked to UNK ear UNK of UNK visitors with his UNK teeth STOP 
START he preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a UNK STOP 
START UNK he would open and UNK UNK STOP 
START given a small ball or UNK he would UNK games and play by himself for hours STOP 
START with curiosity and UNK he explored every inch of UNK beach and burn once UNK himself for hours on a UNK high up a sheer UNK cliff and waiting with calm faith to be UNK by maxwell who nearly lost his life in doing so STOP 
START a year and a day of this UNK is described for the reader one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is UNK but UNK as well STOP 
START in the UNK of UNK there had been no UNK STOP 
START to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply UNK is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted allowing an intense awareness a UNK of the senses STOP 
START now with the increasing UNK between himself and UNK came a knowledge of an obscure need that of being trusted UNK by some creature STOP 
START two other people in time shared UNK love it remained around us three that his UNK UNK when he was not away in his own UNK world of wave and water were his UNK and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse passion and UNK STOP 
START in turn each of us in our own way UNK as gods do upon his worship STOP 
START yet the UNK ended STOP 
START the brief details of UNK death lend depth to the story give it an edge of ironic tragedy STOP 
START man to whom UNK gave endless affection and UNK was responsible in the form of a road worker with a UNK who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man STOP 
START but then through a strange coincidence maxwell UNK to acquire UNK a female UNK and the fascinating story starts once more STOP 
START one is not sure who UNK as the main personality of this book UNK with his UNK ways or maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer UNK UNK and UNK sensitive but never sentimental UNK of an unusual way of life in a language at once UNK and UNK vivid and UNK STOP 
START this UNK read the book when it was first brought out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement STOP 
START now gavin UNK ring of bright water has UNK to UNK the world STOP 
START new york the performances of the comedie UNK are the most important recent events in the new york theater STOP 
START they serve to UNK a popular notion that the comedie merely UNK as accurately as possible the techniques of acting the UNK that UNK in the UNK century STOP 
START on the contrary the old plays are continually being UNK and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the comedie STOP 
START of course the UNK UNK last longer than the others and that further UNK us that the comedie is not UNK to criticism STOP 
START the directors of the comedie do not respond to adverse UNK in as UNK and UNK a manner as the broadway producers who in two instances this season closed their plays after one performance STOP 
START but they are aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full houses and they occasionally dare to experiment in UNK a dramatic classic STOP 
START in france novel approaches to the classic french plays are frequently attempted STOP 
START the government pays a UNK for UNK of the UNK and this policy UNK UNK who sometimes put UNK characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results STOP 
START so far as i know the comedie has never put UNK people in the costumes of the 20th century but they do UNK plays and characters STOP 
START last season the UNK two principal experiments came to UNK and in consequence we can expect fairly soon to see still newer UNK of UNK UNK and UNK school for wives STOP 
START the new UNK was done in UNK century setting instead of ancient greek that is the UNK equivalent for UNK this UNK characters into our own time STOP 
START the speaking of the lines seemed UNK slow and UNK possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of UNK century UNK STOP 
START a few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent STOP 
START the new school for wives was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy the idea of turning some obviously UNK figure into a tragic character STOP 
START among the UNK specialists of some years ago louis UNK tried to UNK some of the UNK while UNK UNK often performing at the comedie made them more gross than UNK may have intended STOP 
START apparently UNK and UNK attempted just these UNK approaches in the role of UNK in the school for wives STOP 
START i say apparently although i saw UNK as UNK when he visited this country shortly before his death that time he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy STOP 
START UNK it will be recalled is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful UNK STOP 
START the part can lend itself to serious treatment influential french critic remarked pity for UNK comes with age STOP 
START accordingly at the comedie last year jean UNK played a sympathetic UNK and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy STOP 
START but the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly STOP 
START UNK the comedie has brought UNK UNK on its tour and has left the school for wives at home STOP 
START UNK is the religious UNK who courts his UNK wife STOP 
START UNK played him as a sincere UNK and UNK at the comedie made him a gross UNK or so the historians tell us STOP 
START louis UNK who formerly played the UNK UNK opposite UNK is the UNK of the present production which he himself directed STOP 
START his UNK UNK the golden mean STOP 
START his red face his UNK UNK and his UNK UNK UNK his UNK STOP 
START but his UNK UNK and his UNK speeches are not merely UNK course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his UNK UNK STOP 
START occasionally UNK draws some UNK deserved UNK by his quick shifts from one personality to another STOP 
START the whole role by the way is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen UNK in his other parts STOP 
START his normal UNK is playing the UNK old man frequently stupid or UNK but never mean or UNK STOP 
START here he is quite UNK the very UNK of UNK and UNK STOP 
START UNK is the dean of the company the oldest actor in point of continuous service STOP 
START in that function he helps to UNK another legend about the comedie STOP 
START we are often told that the comedie has unfortunately UNK with old actors who are both UNK and UNK drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the comedie by staying off the stage STOP 
START UNK however is a fine actor and probably the UNK man in the company his other parts are the leads in the UNK gentleman and the imaginary UNK STOP 
START in UNK UNK the UNK of UNK robert UNK UNK another of the great roles STOP 
START here some UNK is attempted STOP 
START to begin with UNK is a UNK in the old tradition of the clever servant who UNK the strategy of UNK for his master STOP 
START UNK UNK is healthy UNK energetic UNK in his physical UNK and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves STOP 
START UNK says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city UNK of the real world STOP 
START and surely his UNK has a fresh UNK a UNK quality that seems to make him his own master and UNK servant STOP 
START UNK UNK the UNK UNK was a true artist one who demonstrated UNK the power of art to UNK itself and flow into many channels STOP 
START there is hardly a jazz UNK in the business today who doesn't UNK something to UNK STOP 
START and UNK owed much to louis UNK STOP 
START he told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old UNK records he bought in the UNK market in paris STOP 
START it was the first jazz he had heard STOP 
START UNK who was born jean UNK UNK in UNK and who died in 1953 in france was an extraordinary man STOP 
START most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette STOP 
START and this was before he began to play his UNK beautiful jazz STOP 
START you can catch up with him if you haven't already on UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK made up of tracks he recorded with UNK UNK and the UNK of the hot club of france STOP 
START this is a choice item and UNK deserves mention too of course STOP 
START he is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin STOP 
START they play minor swing UNK rose beyond the sea UNK heavy artillery UNK after you've gone where are you my love i saw stars lover man UNK and swing 42 STOP 
START all this is great proceedings get the minutes STOP 
START kid UNK the UNK chicken farmer is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz STOP 
START he dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into new orleans STOP 
START his horn has UNK loud and clear across the land for more years than he UNK to remember STOP 
START good time jazz has released a nice UNK UNK which he made STOP 
START he is UNK against UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK piano UNK guitar UNK bass and minor hall drums STOP 
START the set contains high society do what UNK say down home UNK UNK love jazz me blues weary blues original UNK UNK UNK street parade UNK UNK UNK UNK oh didn't he UNK UNK street blues maryland my maryland UNK UNK UNK la UNK mood UNK and UNK call UNK STOP 
START all this will serve to show off the UNK style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the UNK jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the UNK STOP

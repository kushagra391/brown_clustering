START UNK glanced up at her husband STOP 
START he was going to be sensible and not try to do anything UNK with that gun pointed at him STOP 
START she measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun measured the distance from the men to the back room STOP 
START she decided to risk it STOP 
START there was something phony about all this gun waving something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police STOP 
START dave had the UNK under his UNK now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open STOP 
START in a flash she was away to the back paying no attention to three angry UNK from the male UNK STOP 
START she tore open the back door STOP 
START it was dark inside the room but enough light UNK from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top STOP 
START there was a small UNK with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs STOP 
START slowly she turned to face the men again STOP 
START UNK at the counter was on his feet STOP 
START the distance between where she stood and where dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles STOP 
START keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter she began to feel her way to the door STOP 
START she UNK along the UNK one step at a time STOP 
START the gun followed her STOP 
START as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to UNK STOP 
START the two men watched as dave closed the door behind them watched them cross the sidewalk to their car STOP 
START it was getting light STOP 
START the fat man removed his UNK put on a UNK and wrinkled jacket and UNK it over his UNK STOP

START had enough brains to call UNK up so as UNK could do UNK about it when the parents i UNK let her go go his eyes were lowered so he couldn't have seen the narrow pointed face of his companion suddenly UNK with fury he was aware of it just the same STOP 
START he knew UNK UNK was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be STOP 
START with a curse UNK seized the thing nearest a glass sugar UNK with a UNK metal top and threw it against the wall opposite STOP 
START the heavy glass didn't break but the top flew off UNK with a UNK that was loud in the silence STOP 
START not really startled but careful to appear so UNK UNK UNK on his pipe STOP 
START UNK cursed steadily STOP 
START why does everything have to happen to me quietly got a UNK and started to sweep up the sugar STOP 
START UNK watched him STOP 
START his mouth worked over the UNK the UNK in his vocabulary STOP 
START once he said UNK hell didn't you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off you and UNK ever use your brains fat man didn't answer STOP 
START he got one of the UNK and brushed the UNK sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter STOP 
START he returned the UNK to its place between UNK bottle and paper UNK UNK STOP 
START he spoke UNK STOP

START and i ain't going back there on account of one lousy kid STOP 
START UNK UNK rubbed her face against the blanket STOP 
START she had cried a little because she was frightened STOP 
START she could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car she had figured that out but she couldn't understand their subsequent actions STOP 
START was it because she had shown panic could blame her for that was one thing to UNK outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to UNK in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you STOP 
START she was glad the fat man had left STOP 
START UNK was not really frightening STOP 
START she jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a bottle of UNK STOP 
START she smiled at him UNK STOP 
START although she found she was UNK she was about to refuse never never take candy from a strange man when she saw the bottle was UNK STOP 
START he placed a bottle UNK on the counter STOP 
START so he understood her panic STOP 
START she blew her nose on a tissue and opened the UNK bottle STOP 
START it was icy cold and UNK UNK STOP 
START she felt a lift in spirit STOP 
START when she was finished she pushed it back STOP 
START the man was busy doing something to the inside of the UNK on the UNK side of a car STOP 
START she called softly UNK STOP

START tears a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in she would think about something else STOP 
START her mother and father for instance STOP 
START where were they now her mind she followed the white UNK along the road somewhere between here and the UNK river STOP 
START her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't UNK an inch until he crossed the bridge at the falls and took the river road to UNK and finally turned in at their own driveway at UNK UNK heights STOP 
START then he would UNK and stretch and UNK all out STOP 
START this is the end of the line STOP

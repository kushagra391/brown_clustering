START too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living is not so for education offers all kinds of UNK including how to pull the UNK over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife STOP 
START if it were not for an old professor who made me read the UNK i would have been UNK on what to do and now i understand why they are UNK who wrote them knew people and what made people UNK STOP 
START i worked for my uncle an uncle by marriage so you will not think this has a mild UNK of incest who ran one of those antique shops in new UNK UNK UNK the old french quarter STOP 
START the arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day STOP 
START the rest of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting STOP 
START i had a UNK studio which UNK an ancient UNK filled with flowers and plants UNK UNK in the southern sun STOP 
START i had come to new orleans two years earlier after UNK college partly because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there STOP 
START when my uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted STOP 
START the arrangement turned out to be excellent STOP 
START i loved the city and i particularly loved the UNK and spirit of UNK UNK STOP 
START i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another UNK UNK celebration with romance in the air when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of UNK eyes were waiting around the next corner STOP 
START the very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure STOP 
START it was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes cover their faces with UNK and go UNK STOP 
START my uncle and i were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages STOP 
START sometimes i wondered vaguely what he did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither of us said anything STOP 
START one monday morning i saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt STOP 
START they were married over the UNK though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty STOP 
START she looked more like twenty-five or six STOP 
START it was really a may and december combination STOP 
START my new aunt was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long time since i had seen as UNK a woman who UNK sex STOP 
START there was something about the UNK of her face her smile that was like new orleans UNK the way she held her head the way she walked there was scarcely anything she did which did not UNK me STOP 
START her legs were the full UNK kind full UNK like a rare wine and just as UNK to the appetite calf was magnificent the UNK perfect STOP 
START you must forgive me if i seem to UNK too much on her physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical body STOP 
START the true artist is like one of those scientists who from a single bone can UNK an UNK entire body STOP 
START the artist looks at an UNK a calf a UNK and in his UNK eye the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is STOP 
START and that is the way i first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store STOP 
START that she impressed me instantly was obvious was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly UNK them STOP 
START i thought i saw a faint UNK of color rise to her neck and quickly UNK her cheeks STOP 
START true she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i did not know or much care STOP 
START she was standing with her back to the glass door STOP 
START her form was UNK and with the strong light i could see the UNK of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired STOP 
START as it is in so many affairs of the heart a man and a woman meet and something UNK STOP 
START something UNK in this instance but i treated her UNK and i felt that she knew it for we both kept our distance STOP 
START when she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was UNK lest my uncle notice it STOP 
START and then i became aware that she too glanced at me UNK STOP 
START i felt that her eyes were UNK me as if she were a painter and i a nude model STOP 
START i dismissed these feelings as UNK thinking but i could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to UNK on it because of our relationship STOP 
START when our eyes met the air was filled with an UNK message of me too STOP 
START you have probably experienced this STOP 
START it is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly UNK with a high charge of electricity STOP 
START why she married him i do not know STOP 
START i myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me STOP 
START he already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had all the signs of one who UNK the UNK of living STOP 
START perhaps with my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed maybe she liked men old enough to be her father women with father UNK do STOP 
START for several weeks we UNK one another almost like UNK partners and then one day uncle was slightly UNK and stayed home bride opened the store STOP 
START i was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my UNK UNK STOP 
START even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a UNK flush that UNK her neck and moved UNK to her cheeks and UNK i realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights STOP 
START the UNK depth UNK with UNK UNK to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk STOP 
START she placed her UNK fingers UNK on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say now what next was aware of a UNK look in her eyes that told me the time was UNK STOP 
START there was little UNK of any customers walking in at that hour STOP 
START i was standing beside her watching the UNK UNK and wondering about the old UNK UNK against the wall on which he sometimes UNK STOP 
START i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms UNK me in a UNK UNK STOP 
START her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts was warm and moist and tender STOP 
START i heard her UNK we'd better lock the door STOP 
START it did not take me long to slip the UNK UNK and return to the rear and its couch STOP 
START when we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said he will not always be UNK STOP 
START i know STOP 
START i was thinking about that STOP 
START how will we work it out i don't know she said STOP 
START you're the man STOP 
START you figure it out STOP 
START i've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met STOP 
START i guess we both felt it STOP 
START i said STOP 
START i guess so she said STOP 
START but now what as i said it i realized that an education can be UNK STOP 
START i know what we can do i said STOP 
START tell him i made a pass at you STOP 
START she raised a UNK hand with a startled air STOP 
START what are you trying to do thrown out i even UNK at it do you think it will matter that you are his UNK and not even a blood UNK i don't want to be thrown out and i don't think i will STOP 
START i think i have a way so we can carry on without his UNK us STOP 
START by telling him you are making passes at me said UNK STOP 
START when i was in college i grinned i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class STOP 
START i don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or UNK century poets STOP 
START in those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some UNK to tell now i think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us STOP 
START tomorrow UNK UNK opens officially STOP 
START a lot of people will UNK the streets in costumes and UNK and having a ball STOP 
START there will be romance and UNK STOP 
START if you tell him i made a pass at you he might think you UNK something i said or did so instead of just telling him i made a pass say i tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a UNK i really am STOP 
START we made a UNK tomorrow evening at nine on some street near lake UNK STOP 
START and to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead STOP 
START you are both the same size STOP 
START he could use your clothes for a UNK and a heavy UNK for a UNK STOP 
START when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it STOP 
START but you she began STOP 
START don't worry about me STOP 
START it will turn out all right STOP 
START i don't understand she insisted STOP 
START are you trying to cut your throat no i UNK i'm just beginning to collect UNK on my investment in education STOP 
START as we expected on the following day my uncle was completely UNK and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning STOP 
START i felt that he looked at me UNK and UNK and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife STOP 
START i quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days STOP 
START i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his UNK to keep the date STOP 
START shortly before nine i drove my UNK to the street facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the UNK corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view STOP 
START a few minutes later i saw my UNK car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner STOP 
START i must say the figure was well made up STOP 
START if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him STOP 
START in one hand he gripped firmly a UNK though there had been no indication of rain STOP 
START i suspected why he brought it along STOP 
START in the half darkness i approached UNK making sure he did not see me STOP 
START he was looking out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without UNK words i UNK him hard across the face STOP 
START you cheap UNK exclaimed STOP 
START you cheap no good UNK UNK get a good loyal husband UNK and you fall for a pass by his own UNK should UNK be ashamed of yourself STOP

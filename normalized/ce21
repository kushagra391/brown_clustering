START most recreation work calls for a good deal of UNK STOP 
START this is particularly true in site selection STOP 
START you must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are must have a list of requirements on where how many and what type sites are needed STOP 
START with such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available STOP 
START begin the examination of a site with a good map and UNK UNK if possible STOP 
START these are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies STOP 
START the new UNK of UNK maps being made by the federal government are excellent for UNK yourself to the natural features of the site STOP 
START these are UNK and available from the u. s. UNK society washington 25 d. c. STOP 
START in recent years many counties and the u. s. forest service have taken UNK UNK which show features in detail and are very good for planning use STOP 
START most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the UNK office showing UNK of land STOP 
START inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation STOP 
START this gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions the exposure to the sun and wind the water interests UNK which vary greatly with the seasons STOP 
START it is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site STOP 
START these are a great aid for planning use back at the office STOP 
START for site planning work it is best to have a qualified and experienced park UNK to carry through the study STOP 
START however there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation STOP 
START county judges commissioners engineers assessors and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences STOP 
START a visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or UNK opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area STOP 
START how much study is required of course depends on the character of the site itself the previous experience of the UNK and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision STOP 
START it is too easy for the UNK person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone STOP 
START usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions STOP 
START a site may be a UNK UNK or a UNK piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent UNK for the future with a little development or water STOP 
START the same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use STOP 
START in looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements you need information to compare the site with others STOP 
START you need answers to four important questions STOP 
START what are the existing recreation features well can the site be developed useful will it be to the public this site available the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site STOP 
START naturally a park site with UNK views a good lake trees and sand UNK will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and UNK STOP 
START quality is UNK important STOP 
START UNK on a body of clear clean water will be UNK different from the same amount of UNK on UNK water STOP 
START some recreation features such as UNK values and water interest also have greater overall value than other interests STOP 
START one of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery STOP 
START it may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake colorful rock UNK or unusual trees STOP 
START a site which UNK a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic STOP 
START an area on the coast may have UNK views of the UNK rolling in on a beach STOP 
START a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and UNK STOP 
START note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy STOP 
START water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site STOP 
START most park planners look to water UNK for basic park areas STOP 
START this follows naturally since UNK on an ocean stream or lake provides UNK values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing fishing boating and other water sports STOP 
START a body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use STOP 
START it also UNK the air in summer and UNK the trees and wild life STOP 
START the amount of water UNK the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation afforded by it are important STOP 
START a restricted UNK may be too crowded an area for public use STOP 
START the quantity of water flow may be critical stream or pond which is attractive in the UNK may become UNK or dry in late summer STOP 
START if the site is on a UNK the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied STOP 
START check the quality of the water STOP 
START a stream which has all of its UNK within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by UNK than one passing through UNK UNK or past an industrial area STOP 
START other factors such as water temperature depth of water the fish life it supports wave action UNK UNK will affect its recreation value STOP 
START other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests UNK mountains UNK UNK beaches sand UNK UNK springs UNK with which the area is blessed STOP 
START just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area STOP 
START although the site may not contain the features themselves there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site STOP 
START the route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them STOP 
START a group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be UNK at the site STOP 
START the fish animals and birds which may be found at the site are another interest STOP 
START fishing interest calls for a check of the species found quantity and size the season they are available and the UNK program of the fish commission STOP 
START animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas STOP 
START the site may be on one of the major UNK of UNK birds or have its own resident bird life STOP 
START UNK UNK and other marine life may add interest at UNK areas STOP 
START each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done STOP 
START park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in STOP 
START the historical sign tells its story but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered STOP 
START notice should be taken of unusual rock UNK UNK or shapes of the earth's UNK in your region STOP 
START those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add UNK interest to the recreation sites STOP 
START an old UNK a high UNK an old covered bridge a place to find UNK or other UNK stones or a place to pan gold UNK may be of interest STOP 
START some areas may provide UNK values such as ancient indian village sites or hunting areas UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START how well can the site be developed at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use what can be done to correct the UNK and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites STOP 
START many things need to be checked size and shape the size of the area alone can be a determining factor STOP 
START an area may be too small for the needs of the project STOP 
START areas should be large enough to include the UNK have ample space for the use of facilities needed and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from UNK by private developments STOP 
START acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones STOP 
START shape of the area is also related to the use UNK and needs of the development STOP 
START a large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or UNK several hundred feet in width in UNK to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide STOP 
START this is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful UNK equal in all directions STOP 
START however a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments or to provide additional stream UNK for a UNK trail or include UNK strips within the park unit STOP 
START adjoining areas the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands ownership and use of the land and the UNK available there STOP 
START for instance a site adjoining other publicly owned lands such as a national forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not STOP 
START the UNK available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site STOP 
START UNK UNK is very important STOP 
START check the UNK of the ground degree and direction of UNK drainage rock UNK UNK types and quality as well as UNK STOP 
START nearly level areas are required for parking areas beaches camp areas UNK UNK STOP 
START determine how much UNK limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or UNK might be STOP 
START water in addition to its recreation interests water is needed for drinking sanitation and UNK STOP 
START the quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection STOP 
START the area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines STOP 
START figure the cost of providing water to the use areas STOP 
START plants the existing plant growth calls for thorough UNK STOP 
START look at the trees as to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy they are the problems of maintenance fire UNK wind throw UNK STOP 
START an area may have been partially UNK and requires removal of UNK or UNK STOP 
START some UNK may be of good UNK value other areas of brush may need to be cleared STOP 
START the extent and location of open areas is noted STOP 
START exposure how much will wind rain sun and temperature affect the use area UNK from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use STOP 
START the direction velocity and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area STOP 
START lack of UNK and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and UNK of a site to make it UNK STOP 
START sometimes you have a choice of exposure for sites where the UNK or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended STOP 
START improvements some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings roads UNK cleared land UNK which may raise the cost of the site STOP

START the UNK UNK crisis ambassador stevenson yesterday described the UNK problem of UNK a temporary successor to the late UNK hammarskjold as the UNK crisis the institution has faced STOP 
START of course it is STOP 
START if the decision goes wrong it may be as mr. stevenson fears the first step on the UNK path UNK to a u.n. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning STOP 
START the UNK of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be as the charter puts it the chief administrative officer of the organization but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the organization STOP 
START in other words the secretary general is to be a UNK international servant not a political national one STOP 
START he should be as UNK hammarskjold certainly was a citizen of the world STOP 
START the charter does UNK that due regard shall be paid to the importance of UNK the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible STOP 
START the united states and its allies have had no objection to this STOP 
START what they have objected to is the attempt of the russians to make use of the tragedy of UNK UNK death to turn the entire u.n. staff from the secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come STOP 
START the controversy now UNK mainly around the number and UNK origin of the deputies of the secretary general and more particularly around the nature of his relationship with them STOP 
START although the united states and the UNK have been UNK whether there shall be four five or six top assistants the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work STOP 
START if any one of them has any power to UNK the secretary UNK decisions the nature of the organization will have changed STOP 
START if they give him advice when he asks it or if they perform specified duties under his direction the nature of the u. n. will not of necessity change STOP 
START the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly the power to act to propose action and to organize action without being UNK by advisers and assistants acting on someone UNK instructions STOP 
START this is the root issue for which the united states should stand STOP 
START we should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of UNK STOP 
START what we must have if the united nations is to survive is as UNK UNK an organization at the top as human beings can make it subject to no single nation's direction and UNK to no single nation's ambition STOP 
START what the new charter does the new city charter which should get a yes vote as question no. 1 on nov. 7 would not make a good mayor out of a bad one STOP 
START there is no such magic in UNK laws STOP 
START but it would greatly strengthen any UNK executive powers remove the excuse in large degree that he is a UNK of UNK in the board of estimate increase his UNK authority both as to expense and capital UNK and UNK in him the right to UNK city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy STOP 
START UNK power is removed from the board of estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the city council and the mayor STOP 
START thus there is a clearer division of authority administrative and legislative STOP 
START the board is UNK in both respects while it UNK control over UNK UNK UNK UNK sale UNK and assignment of property and other UNK functions STOP 
START the board will be able to increase decrease add or eliminate budget items subject to the UNK UNK the city council will now share fully this UNK power STOP 
START UNK of UNK UNK on budget changes will require UNK by board and council and a two-thirds vote STOP 
START the UNK UNK his essential fiscal UNK functions broad but little used UNK powers are confirmed STOP 
START he loses UNK tax collection duties which go to the finance department STOP 
START on net balance in spite of UNK UNK opposition to the new charter as an invasion of his office the UNK will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now STOP 
START UNK presidents while UNK membership in the board of estimate lose their UNK functions STOP 
START highways go to a new department of highways UNK to the department of public works such street cleaning as UNK presidents now do in UNK and UNK to the sanitation department STOP 
START some fiscal changes are important STOP 
START the expense operating budget is to be a program budget and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy with the mayor UNK in fund transfers within a department STOP 
START the capital budget for construction of permanent improvements becomes an UNK document instead of just a calendar of UNK promises as a UNK UNK each new project must UNK a board of estimate public hearing before construction proceeds STOP 
START a road block to desirable local or UNK improvements UNK dependent on the UNK vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected STOP 
START this will have a beneficial effect by UNK public business will also correct some UNK STOP 
START UNK of the city council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow STOP 
START UNK press the UNK press association which blankets the western hemisphere from northern canada to cape horn is meeting in new york city this week for the first time in eleven years STOP 
START the i. a. p. a. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the cuban revolution STOP 
START as the press in cuba was gradually UNK by the castro regime more and more cuban publishers editors and UNK were forced into UNK STOP 
START the i. a. p. a. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the UNK of the castro government and the return of the cuban press to the freedom it knew before UNK dictatorship began in 1952 STOP 
START freedom of the press was lost in cuba because of decades of corruption and social UNK STOP 
START in such conditions all UNK are lost STOP 
START this in more diplomatic language is what UNK stevenson told the newspaper men of latin america yesterday on behalf of the united states government STOP 
START he felt able to end on a note of hope STOP 
START he sees evidence of fair winds for the UNK alliance for progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms STOP 
START no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the UNK press association STOP 
START meeting in moscow the UNK soviet communist party congress opens in moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced STOP 
START according to the original program premier khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the kremlin this morning to be filled with UNK or rage depending upon individual or national politics because of the bold program for building communism in our time which the congress will adopt STOP 
START but far from being concerned about whether or not russia will have achieved utopia by UNK the world is watching moscow today primarily for UNK as to whether or not there will be nuclear UNK in the immediate future STOP 
START the evident contradiction between the UNK picture of russia's progress painted by the communist UNK program and the enormous dangers for all humanity UNK by premier khrushchev's berlin policy has already led to UNK abroad that the program may be severely altered STOP 
START whether it is or not the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated STOP 
START and there must be many soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for UNK they and their children must first survive STOP 
START this congress will see premier khrushchev UNK his power and laying the UNK for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years STOP 
START the widespread UNK that has taken place the past twelve months or so among communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will UNK the congress and the central committee it will UNK will all have passed the UNK possible khrushchev UNK both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job STOP 
START dr. UNK call to action dr. james b. UNK has earned a UNK reputation as a moderate and UNK school UNK STOP 
START his earlier reports considered the american public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change STOP 
START now a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities including new york has shattered this optimism STOP 
START dr. UNK has come away shocked and angry STOP 
START his new book entitled UNK and suburbs calls for fast and drastic action to UNK disaster STOP 
START there is room for disagreement concerning some of dr. UNK specific views STOP 
START his strong opposition to the transfer of negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be attacked by negro leaders who have fought for and achieved this open or UNK UNK STOP 
START dr. UNK may UNK the psychological importance of even UNK equality STOP 
START his suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves even though what he is UNK is already taking shape as a trend STOP 
START but these are side issues to a powerful central theme STOP 
START that theme cuts through UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START it UNK the UNK especially the negro UNK as UNK streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters STOP 
START the UNK of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters and dr. UNK UNK employers and labor unions alike STOP 
START the facts he UNK are hidden from public view by UNK objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on UNK integration rather than on real improvement of the schools regardless of the color of their students STOP 
START a call for action before it is too late has UNK implications when it comes from a man who in his previous reports on the schools UNK so strongly against extreme measures STOP 
START these UNK must not be treated lightly STOP 
START dr. UNK UNK UNK efforts deserve the nation's UNK STOP 
START he has served in positions of greater UNK both at home and abroad he may well be doing his greatest service with his UNK report on the state of the public schools STOP 
START and now more UNK mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called UNK mail STOP 
START he was delighted to learn that the post office department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from representatives in congress to their UNK without the use of UNK names addresses or even zone numbers STOP 
START in accordance with legislation passed at the last session of congress each representative is authorized to deliver to the post office in bulk UNK speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district STOP 
START this means an added burden to UNK UNK who already are UNK of heavy UNK and low pay and it presumably means an increased UNK deficit but our correspondent writes think of the additional UNK mail each citizen will now be UNK to receive on a regular basis STOP 
START our UNK do not forget us letter writing is a dying art STOP 
START occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another but these are mostly UNK STOP 
START most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter STOP

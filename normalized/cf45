START with capital largely UNK there seemed to them no other course to pursue STOP 
START the directors sold directly to UNK who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company STOP 
START these UNK UNK where they wished and generally dealt with the indians through UNK who might be UNK UNK or even soldiers STOP 
START the UNK also had to pay a tax of UNK on the goods they UNK and all UNK were to be taken to company stores and UNK to france in company ships STOP 
START the company disposed of the UNK but with what profit the records do not show STOP 
START in UNK with its UNK policy the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal indians STOP 
START the UNK use of presents had been effective in expanding the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century and the change in UNK aroused resentment in the minds of the red men STOP 
START traders from the english UNK were far more generous and indian loyalty turned to them STOP 
START protests from UNK and UNK passed UNK and the UNK policy of the company probably let loose indian UNK that brought ruin to the company STOP 
START in UNK the king sent three commissioners to louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony STOP 
START they ordered the raising of troops and obtained UNK UNK with which to build UNK STOP 
START they adopted a program by which louisiana was divided into five districts STOP 
START in each of these there was to be a strong military post and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses STOP 
START for UNK louisiana mobile was the principal post and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east in the region threatened by british traders STOP 
START mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending UNK to the sources of the tennessee river STOP 
START fort UNK on the alabama river had been erected in UNK for trade with the UNK and UNK but money was available for only one other new post near the present UNK tennessee and this was soon abandoned STOP 
START west of the mobile district was the lower mississippi district of which new orleans was headquarters STOP 
START dependent upon it were posts on the lower mississippi and the region UNK to the UNK of new UNK STOP 
START on the middle mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the arkansas STOP 
START it was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of UNK from the west UNK down the arkansas river STOP 
START on the ohio or UNK was to be built another post at the fork of two great rivers STOP 
START other posts would be established up the ohio and UNK to protect communication with canada STOP 
START on the upper mississippi the illinois post was to be established near UNK and dependent posts were to be built on the missouri where there are mines in abundance STOP 
START each of the five principal posts was to have a director responsible to a UNK at new orleans STOP 
START an elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way STOP 
START UNK were to be under the supervision of the directors STOP 
START UNK must be loyal to the UNK and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended STOP 
START the UNK were to be encouraged to trade and were to UNK of their UNK to the UNK STOP 
START only two principal UNK were actually established one at mobile the other at new orleans STOP 
START new orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the mississippi and west of that river and on the ohio and UNK STOP 
START mobile was also supplied by new orleans with goods for the mobile district STOP 
START the power that UNK exercised during his first administration cannot be determined STOP 
START regulations for the indian trade were made by the UNK UNK de la UNK and UNK apparently did not have control of that body STOP 
START the UNK even treated the serious matter of british UNK as its business and on its own authority sent to UNK UNK UNK suitable for the UNK trade STOP 
START it decided also that the purely secular efforts of UNK were UNK and sent UNK to win the UNK from the UNK UNK STOP 
START during the first administration of UNK the UNK trade of the mobile district was a UNK source of revenue STOP 
START the UNK brought in annually UNK to UNK UNK and the UNK and UNK brought the total up to UNK UNK STOP 
START these UNK were the raw material for the manufacture of leather and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for european goods STOP 
START during his first administration UNK succeeded in keeping carolina traders out of the alabama country and the UNK country STOP 
START the director of the post at mobile kept an adequate amount of french goods of a kind to which they were accustomed to supply the indian needs STOP 
START the alabama and UNK rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and UNK STOP 
START de la UNK commander of the alabama post had the friendship of the natives and was able to make them look upon the british as poor UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK the most prominent UNK in the district was energetic and UNK but his methods often aroused the UNK of the french UNK STOP 
START he became after a time commander of a post on the alabama river but his operations extended from mobile throughout the district and he finally obtained a monopoly of the indian trade STOP 
START the UNK were the principal source of trouble in the mobile district STOP 
START their territory lay to the north near the sources of the alabama the UNK the tennessee and UNK rivers and was easily UNK to traders among the UNK UNK STOP 
START in UNK some UNK UNK the french traders among them and did not make peace for four years STOP 
START UNK traders however continued to come to them from mobile and to obtain a considerable number of UNK for the french markets STOP 
START british traders from south carolina UNK the indians against the french and there developed french and british UNK in the UNK STOP 
START the UNK finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the french control of louisiana STOP 
START to hold them was an essential part of french policy for they controlled the upper UNK of the UNK from the north to mobile STOP 
START they threatened constantly to give the british a hold on this region from UNK they could move easily down the rivers to the french UNK near the gulf STOP 
START UNK realized that if the french were to hold the UNK tribes against the UNK of british goods french traders must be able to offer a supply as UNK as the UNK and at reasonable prices STOP 
START his UNK brought some results STOP 
START the company of the UNK promised to send over a supply of indian trading goods and to price them more UNK in terms of UNK STOP 
START but it coupled with this a requirement that indians must bring their UNK to mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the indian country STOP 
START the insistence of UNK upon giving liberal prices to the indians in order to drive back the carolina traders was probably a factor that led to his recall in UNK STOP 
START for two years his friend and cousin UNK remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance STOP 
START although he UNK a few friendly indians to UNK the UNK and even kill some of them the carolina advance continued STOP 
START the company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from carolina and when UNK came over as governor in UNK he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the mobile district STOP 
START but the company of the UNK holding to its program of economy made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices STOP 
START to the directors the problem appeared a matter of UNK or diplomacy STOP 
START UNK attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to UNK among the indians STOP 
START these agents were to UNK the difference between english and french goods and the prices charged the indians STOP 
START they were to UNK the UNK UNK and wherever possible to UNK the natives to UNK the traders from carolina STOP 
START they were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men as well as an UNK supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering STOP 
START UNK UNK gained some successes STOP 
START the UNK divided into two UNK was british and the other french STOP 
START so hostile did these UNK become that among the UNK civil war broke out STOP 
START UNK efforts however were on the whole UNK in winning back the tribes of the mobile district and he decided to send troops into the troubled country STOP 
START he asked the government for two hundred soldiers who were to be specifically assigned to arrest english traders and UNK indians STOP 
START in spite of the company's restrictions he planned to build new posts in the territory STOP 
START he asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the UNK UNK STOP 
START no help came from the crown and UNK in UNK gave a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to UNK STOP 
START UNK went vigorously to work and gave credit to many UNK STOP 
START but they brought back few UNK to pay their debts and soon french trade in the region was at an end STOP 
START UNK finally in one last bid in UNK cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france STOP 
START the indians were not impressed and held to the carolina traders who UNK over the country almost to the mississippi STOP 
START with the loss of the mobile trade which ended all profits from louisiana the UNK indians UNK STOP 
START they destroyed a trading house and UNK the goods and UNK french shipping on the mississippi STOP 
START the war to UNK them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts STOP 
START in january UNK the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony STOP 
START it stated that it had lost UNK UNK in its operations and apparently UNK its poor success largely on the indian trade STOP 
START it offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade but asked an UNK STOP 
START the king accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK the commerce of louisiana was free to all UNK STOP 
START company rule in louisiana left the colony without UNK arms UNK or supplies STOP 
START the difficulties of trade had ruined many UNK and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear UNK families STOP 
START others left the country and there was no one familiar with the indian trade STOP 
START if this trade should be resumed the UNK who had come to be farmers or UNK and soldiers UNK from the army must be hardened to the severe life of UNK de UNK STOP 
START this was a slow and difficult course and french trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders STOP 
START these men were without capital or experience STOP 
START UNK and UNK the UNK wished either to UNK the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would UNK their debts with UNK STOP 
START UNK who returned to succeed UNK in UNK objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of UNK a trade in which they could see no hope of profits STOP 
START he reported too that among the UNK there were none of UNK and ability sufficient to justify UNK them with the king's goods STOP 
START he did find some to trust however and he employed the king's soldiers to trade STOP 
START with no company to UNK he kept close control over all the traders STOP 
START in order to compete with english traders UNK radically changed the price schedule STOP 
START the king should expect no profit and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france which would cover the expense of transportation and handling was all he charged the traders STOP

START new rule no. 2 build from the outside in try to build from the inside out STOP 
START don't insert your components into fixed UNK they may or may not fit your components before you close them in STOP 
START for example don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall UNK and set the UNK STOP 
START it's a lot UNK and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the UNK and erect the end wall after they are all in place STOP 
START set your UNK before you close in the end of the bathroom STOP 
START don't try to UNK a UNK tub af through a narrow doorway STOP 
START finish your UNK before you frame it in most economical UNK is a thin UNK UNK on either side of the UNK STOP 
START finish UNK and UNK up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in STOP 
START there is no better way to waste time than trying to UNK a furnace in a finished af closet STOP 
START don't position your UNK before you insert your windows in conventional construction way you may pay more to UNK the window into place than you paid for the window STOP 
START you can save all that UNK time if you set your windows in one two three order first the UNK on one side then the window then the UNK on the other side STOP 
START UNK your UNK UNK or stairs to the attic and finish your overhead UNK before you UNK the ceiling STOP 
START don't close in your house until everything has been carried in STOP 
START last wall bob UNK UNK is the wall between the house and garage STOP 
START that way he can truck his parts right UNK and UNK them under the roof STOP 
START no auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the UNK in the block STOP 
START and trailer makers those most UNK and therefore most efficient of UNK say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out STOP 
START new rule no. 3 UNK everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you STOP 
START this revolution is the biggest UNK news of all because 1 STOP 
START it makes it easy to handle much heavier units so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier UNK components like those shown in the pictures alongside STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START it makes materials handling the only construction cost that like UNK and UNK should be lower today than in UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START it changes the answers to who should do what and where UNK the need for costly UNK UNK and increases the chance for shop UNK where almost everything can be made better and cheaper STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START it changes the answers on when to do what at the site STOP 
START for example instead of putting in your UNK last as many builders do you can now save money by putting them in first STOP 
START instead of closing the house in first as most builders do you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to see p UNK STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START it changes the answers on UNK relations STOP 
START not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by buying direct and UNK the dealer STOP 
START but now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by UNK up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed UNK inside the house UNK along the sides UNK on the walls UNK on the roof etc. STOP 
START says UNK thompson we dealers must earn our UNK by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself STOP 
START the revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier STOP 
START the revolution is well under way but much more remains to be done STOP 
START UNK years ago a house home round table UNK by the lumber UNK research council reported UNK only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit UNK one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit UNK one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit UNK one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit UNK STOP 
START so from raw materials to finished UNK the costs of materials handling most of it UNK add up to UNK of the total construction cost of housing STOP 
START that house home round table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling says UNK thompson long chairman of the lumber UNK research council STOP 
START it made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of UNK between manufacturer UNK equipment maker dealer and builder all working together to cut the cost of materials handling STOP 
START before that we lumber dealers were working almost UNK on the problem STOP 
START here is where things stand today 1 STOP 
START almost all of the UNK lumber dealers who UNK primarily to the UNK market and supply UNK of this year's new houses are UNK STOP 
START there are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by UNK everything at lower cost just where his UNK will need it STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START practically all UNK housing products can now be ordered in standard units UNK or UNK for mechanical handling including lumber UNK UNK glass block face brick plaster lime UNK UNK UNK and UNK cement UNK UNK floor tile UNK tile plaster base and UNK UNK STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START truck and UNK equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every UNK need STOP 
START for some significant new items see the pictures STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START more than 50% of all lumber is UNK UNK survey found that at least UNK lumber mills will UNK their shipments for UNK handling STOP 
START of these UNK said they make no extra charge for UNK in standard units because they save enough on UNK UNK to UNK their UNK cost STOP 
START most of the others will UNK their UNK to UNK charge rather than lose a good customer STOP 
START with a UNK UNK dealers can UNK UNK lumber from UNK box cars for UNK compared with UNK or more to UNK loose lumber one piece at a time says james wright of aj STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for UNK shipments UNK wide by a nominal UNK high or six UNK UNK UNK wide by nominal UNK high STOP 
START these units make it easy to load as much as UNK UNK say UNK UNK in a UNK box car much more than the average for UNK cars STOP 
START 6 STOP 
START the railroads have responded by adding UNK more box cars with doors UNK or wider for UNK UNK a UNK increase while the total number of box cars was falling UNK and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber UNK in heavily loaded cars STOP 
START first was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of UNK UNK came a 1961 cut on the west coast still pending elsewhere of UNK on UNK UNK UNK which works out to more than UNK on that portion of the load in excess of UNK UNK STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START more UNK lumber is being UNK on flat cars and UNK studies show that flat cars loaded with the new type UNK UNK method can be UNK for as little as UNK STOP 
START for long UNK these shipments should be protected with UNK paper STOP 
START this costs from UNK to UNK but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open STOP 
START these carriers cut handling costs for the dealer and the builder STOP 
START UNK UNK james wright since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have UNK more radical changes than any of the UNK other equipment STOP 
START the reason today's components and lumber UNK are far too UNK to be handled by a UNK and a UNK STOP 
START so manufacturers have UNK a new type of vehicle the UNK UNK STOP 
START it cuts the lumber UNK cost because it takes only one man the driver to UNK it and because it UNK in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand UNK STOP 
START and it helps the builder because it can handle a more UNK UNK load can deliver it to the best spot in some cases right on the roof or inside the house and never takes any of the UNK UNK labor to help UNK it STOP 
START says wright our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the UNK of their materials handling in the coming two years STOP 
START and most of the gain will be in UNK vehicles STOP 
START new rule no. 4 what your men do to help them waste less of the time you pay for STOP 
START UNK the UNK you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time or the right materials were not delivered to the UNK spots or materials were not UNK in the right order for UNK or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit or your UNK had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip STOP 
START even america's most efficient builder bob UNK of UNK hopes to cut his labor costs another UNK per house as a result of the UNK studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the stanley works STOP 
START already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation UNK from UNK to UNK by eliminating idle time and wasted motion STOP 
START builder eddie UNK of washington past president of UNK cut his UNK costs UNK a house by adopting the UNK UNK process worked out after careful UNK studies by the structural clay products research foundation to help UNK do better work for less STOP 
START a UNK builder cut his labor costs per thousand UNK from UNK to UNK by adopting this same process cut them another UNK to UNK by buying his UNK in convenient UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK process with its precision UNK its precision guide lines its working level UNK and its UNK brick supply takes eight UNK to get set but once ready it makes it easy for UNK to lay a thousand UNK a day STOP 
START see page UNK STOP 
START one good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew STOP 
START reports jim UNK by studying men on the job we found that two men a UNK and a UNK can lay a floor faster than three STOP 
START we found that three men two UNK and a UNK can put up wall panels or UNK more economically than four men because four men don't make two teams make one UNK UNK team STOP 
START we found that wherever you can use two teams on a job five men not four is the magic number STOP 
START no house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled STOP 
START new rule no. 5 waste any UNK time on green lumber to save UNK a UNK STOP 
START this is the most UNK UNK UNK a builder can commit STOP 
START green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster when the UNK lumber was bound to UNK and then UNK as tons of water dried out the UNK STOP 
START but now that all production builders build with UNK and all smart builders build with panels green lumber is an UNK you cannot afford STOP 
START green UNK cost about UNK UNK cost less than UNK more STOP 
START so if a green UNK makes a UNK or a UNK UNK or anybody else waste even 20 seconds the green UNK becomes more expensive than a dry UNK STOP

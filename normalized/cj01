START 1 STOP 
START UNK it has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their UNK STOP 
START the results of present observations of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal UNK of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during UNK e.g. UNK 1958 STOP 
START when sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available it will be possible to set limits on the thermal and electrical characteristics of the surface and UNK materials of the moon STOP 
START observations of the radio emission of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will UNK the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise UNK information about the characteristics of the solid surface STOP 
START radio observations of venus and UNK have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets STOP 
START the observed intensity of the radio emission of venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about UNK STOP 
START this result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and UNK components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence STOP 
START for the case of UNK the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a UNK UNK and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and UNK components STOP 
START of the remaining planets only mars and UNK have been observed as radio sources and not very much information is available STOP 
START mars has been observed twice at about UNK wave length and the intensity of the observed radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of mars STOP 
START the low intensity of the radiation from UNK has limited observations but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal origin STOP 
START no attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported and because of their distances small UNK or low temperatures the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity STOP 
START in spite of this the very large radio UNK and improved UNK techniques which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets in a few years STOP 
START the study of the radio emission of the moon and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at UNK wave length by UNK and UNK 1946 STOP 
START this was followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the UNK emission of the moon over three UNK UNK by UNK and UNK 1949 STOP 
START they UNK from their measurements that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a UNK in a roughly UNK fashion the UNK of the variation was considerably less than the UNK of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by UNK and UNK 1930 and UNK UNK that the maximum of the radio emission came about UNK days after full moon which is again in contrast to the infrared emission which reaches its maximum at full moon STOP 
START UNK and UNK explained their observations by pointing out that UNK materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio waves although UNK to infrared radiation STOP 
START the infrared emission could then be assumed to UNK at the surface of the moon while the radio emission UNK at some depth beneath the surface where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced in UNK and shifted in phase STOP 
START since the absorption of radio waves in UNK material varies with wave length it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly UNK changes in the structure or composition of the UNK surface material STOP 
START the radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955 when UNK and franklin 1955 identified the origin of UNK radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from UNK STOP 
START this UNK type of planetary radiation is discussed by UNK UNK 13 and UNK UNK 14 STOP 
START steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from venus at UNK and UNK cm and from mars and UNK at UNK cm in 1956 UNK UNK and UNK 1958 a b c and from UNK at UNK cm in 1957 UNK and UNK 1958 STOP 
START in the relatively short time since these early observations venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from UNK to UNK cm and UNK has been observed over the UNK range from UNK to UNK aj STOP 
START the UNK characteristics of planetary radio radiation are the intensity the UNK and the direction of arrival of the waves STOP 
START the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc STOP 
START this is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very large UNK now under construction and consequently the radio emission of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved STOP 
START it should be possible however to put useful limits on the UNK of the radio sources by observing with large UNK or with UNK STOP 
START measurements of UNK are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth STOP 
START there have been few measurements specifically for the determination of the UNK of planetary radiation STOP 
START the measurements made with the UNK UNK UNK which is UNK would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured UNK of venus and UNK if a substantial part of the radiation had been UNK UNK STOP 
START recent UNK measurements UNK and roberts 1960 have shown the UNK emission of UNK to be partially UNK and to UNK in a region of larger diameter than the visible disk STOP 
START other than this very significant result most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted to the intensity of the radiation STOP 
START the concept of apparent UNK temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets STOP 
START the received radiation is compared with the radiation from a UNK black body which UNK the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet STOP 
START the apparent UNK disk temperature is the temperature which must be assumed for the black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that of the observed radiation STOP 
START the use of this concept does not specify the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really UNK as a black body will the apparent UNK temperature UNK to the physical temperature of the UNK material STOP 
START the radio radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should be UNK compared with their thermal emission at UNK wave lengths except possibly at times of exceptional UNK of solar radio noise STOP 
START the UNK level of UNK UNK solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than UNK STOP 
START at UNK wave lengths an increase of the order of UNK in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would be expected STOP 
START therefore UNK the extreme UNK reflected solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the UNK and UNK range STOP 
START 2 STOP 
START -hlthe moon UNK observations radio observations of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from UNK UNK to 75 cm and the results are UNK in table 1 STOP 
START observations have also been made at 1.5 UNK using optical techniques UNK 1955 1956 also UNK 11 STOP 
START not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the UNK brightness distribution when reducing the data and this together with differences in the methods of UNK the UNK and UNK must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures STOP 
START in the observations at UNK UNK UNK 1959 the diameter of the antenna beam UNK was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the UNK surface and UNK UNK have been made of the UNK brightness distribution at three UNK phases STOP 
START these observations indicate that the UNK maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the UNK regions STOP 
START mare UNK seems to be an exception and remains cooler than the regions which UNK it STOP 
START these UNK UNK also suggest a rather rapid UNK in the radio brightness with UNK STOP 
START very recently observations have been made at UNK wave length with a UNK 22 meters in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about UNK UNK UNK and UNK 1960 STOP 
START the UNK contours are much UNK than those observed at UNK UNK by UNK 1959 and apparently the emission at 8 UNK is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface features STOP 
START such UNK observations as these are needed at several wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpreted STOP 
START the observations of UNK UNK and UNK at UNK cm and of UNK at UNK cm have not previously been published and will be briefly described STOP 
START measurements at UNK cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval may 3 to june 19 1956 using the UNK UNK at the u. s. naval research laboratory in washington STOP 
START the UNK diameter of the antenna beam was about UNK and the angle UNK by the moon included the entire main beam and part of the first side UNK STOP 
START the antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both measured UNK UNK and UNK 1958 so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon was known STOP 
START the ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift UNK across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is UNK was found by UNK integration of the antenna UNK UNK to be UNK STOP 
START the measured brightness temperature is a good UNK to the brightness temperature at the center of the UNK disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the UNK disk is nearly uniform STOP 
START the result of the observations is af where the phase angle q is measured in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute as well as relative errors STOP 
START this result is UNK along with the UNK observations of UNK 1958 in figure 1 a STOP 
START the variation in the UNK emission of the moon during a UNK is very much less than the variation in the UNK emission as would be expected from the explanation of UNK and UNK 1949 STOP 
START in the discussion which follows the time average of the radio emission will be referred to as the constant component and the UNK UNK variation will be called the variable component STOP 
START the UNK observation of UNK was made on may 20 1958 using the UNK UNK at the maryland point UNK of the u. s. naval research laboratory STOP 
START the age of the moon was about 2 days STOP 
START the UNK diameter of the main UNK of the antenna was about UNK and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming a UNK shape for the antenna beam and a UNK bright disk for the moon STOP

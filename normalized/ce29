START the controversy of the last few years over whether UNK or interior designers should plan the UNK of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion STOP 
START the UNK do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that therefore the interior designer is incapable of understanding the UNK principles involved in planning the interior of a building STOP 
START ordinary UNK may have UNK against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide UNK in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables UNK or panel discussions whatever they are called on this subject will recognize that the final UNK down UNK of the matter is education STOP 
START it is true that most UNK schools have five year courses some even have six or more STOP 
START the element of public danger which enters so largely into UNK UNK however would demand a prolonged study of structure STOP 
START this would naturally UNK their courses far beyond the largely UNK demands of interior UNK training STOP 
START we may then UNK the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject STOP 
START the real question that follows is how are those four years used and what is their value as training american institute of interior designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage UNK of such a course STOP 
START an examination of some forty UNK of schools offering courses in interior design for the most part schools UNK by membership in the national association of schools of art and a further on the spot inspection of a number of schools show their courses UNK pretty closely to the recommendations STOP 
START one or two of the schools have a five year curriculum but the usual pattern of american education has limited most of them to the UNK plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions STOP 
START the suggested course of the UNK was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many UNK as to UNK necessities STOP 
START obviously the four year provision limits this to UNK and much desirable material must be eliminated STOP 
START without UNK the relative merits of the two courses architecture UNK interior design let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer STOP 
START to begin with what is an interior designer the dictionary of occupational titles published by the u. s. department of labor describes him as follows designs plans and UNK UNK of houses commercial and UNK structures hotels clubs ships theaters as well as set UNK for motion picture arts and television STOP 
START makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture floor UNK wall UNK and determines color UNK STOP 
START UNK complete cost estimates for UNK approval STOP 
START makes necessary purchases places contracts UNK construction installation UNK and placement of furniture UNK and other UNK UNK and follows through to completion of project STOP 
START in addition to this the u. s. civil service bureau when UNK UNK for government positions as interior designers expects that when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them STOP 
START he must be capable of UNK for and UNK the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the UNK STOP 
START this seems like a large order STOP 
START the interior designer then must first be an artist but also understand UNK and painting and lighting and UNK and finance STOP 
START yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any UNK interior designer does know all this and does practice it STOP 
START and further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to UNK and improve his life and to UNK the cultural horizon of our society STOP 
START few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the UNK of their curriculum STOP 
START it is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise STOP 
START the old established independent art schools try their best to UNK their obligations STOP 
START yet even here many a problem is presented in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command design a luxury apartment description of the client or his cultural level no UNK of geographical area or local social necessities simply a luxury apartment STOP 
START working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in UNK and UNK and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design STOP 
START it is possible of course to work on UNK or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel of real interior design demands STOP 
START unfortunately the purely synthetic problem is the rule STOP 
START it is like medical schools in india where in that UNK of religious UNK the UNK of dead bodies is UNK upon STOP 
START instead they learn their UNK on the UNK of plants STOP 
START thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience STOP 
START in the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use STOP 
START but to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is UNK STOP 
START UNK with UNK UNK real estate men fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work STOP 
START fortunately although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow that the student already is in the trade STOP 
START even the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern UNK STOP 
START here too the reality of actual furniture must be experienced STOP 
START the professional organizations such as american institute of interior designers national society of interior designers home UNK league and various trade associations can and do aid greatly in this work STOP 
START certainly every UNK involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations STOP 
START not only should every UNK above the rank of UNK be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations but his first UNK for membership as an UNK should be so sharply UNK that membership would be equivalent to UNK to teach the subject STOP 
START participation for the UNK in this case however would have to be raised to full and complete membership STOP 
START the largest of these organizations at present UNK to the full time UNK any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and indeed UNK him even the right to attach the customary UNK after his name in the college UNK STOP 
START this UNK status of the UNK cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students STOP 
START the professor in turn UNK not UNK the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice STOP 
START this seems somewhat UNK since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations UNK are ever enforced the UNK will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands STOP 
START in one way the UNK and societies do a UNK to the schools STOP 
START that is in the UNK of the grandfather UNK in their membership requirements STOP 
START when these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished UNK could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and UNK during their youth STOP 
START long hard years of on the job training had brought them to their competence STOP 
START the necessity of that day has long disappeared STOP 
START there is plenty of opportunity for proper education today STOP 
START it is UNK for students to realize that the societies do not truly UNK the standards for which they are supposed to stand STOP 
START the reason and the day of grandfather UNK has long since passed STOP 
START no one can deny that these back door UNK to membership provisions have been seriously UNK nor that they have not resulted in the admission of UNK UNK to membership in supposedly learned societies STOP 
START beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves STOP 
START it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education a depth and UNK of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students STOP 
START the local UNK who UNK in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications STOP 
START nor will the UNK the UNK still found in some of the smaller art schools UNK STOP 
START only a few years ago a middle western college UNK a request for a teacher of interior design STOP 
START at the end of its letter was the information that UNK for this position must also be prepared to teach UNK design and advertising art STOP 
START this kind of UNK toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer STOP 
START we must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual UNK of teaching minimal income and minimal status among their UNK STOP 
START considerable UNK in teaching subjects such as architecture furniture design textiles and color is also desirable STOP 
START in all degree courses in interior design a number of academic or general studies courses are included STOP 
START it is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in english history psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art especially interior design as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects STOP 
START the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed STOP 
START the matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account STOP 
START one technical question of school organization comes to mind here STOP 
START for proper UNK of schools teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate STOP 
START since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed STOP 
START indeed it has only been a matter of the last few years that UNK schools of art have granted degrees at all STOP 
START the question however cannot be ignored for long STOP 
START the basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree STOP 
START most professors in the course must naturally again have a higher degree than the course offers STOP 
START one solution is the UNK of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute STOP 
START it is a sort of academic UNK and you solve it STOP 
START this brings us to the question of UNK of art schools in general STOP 
START only the independent art schools that is those not connected with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation before UNK by the various regional organizations STOP 
START it has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of UNK for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department STOP 
START this plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department yet nevertheless claiming that they teach interior design has contributed to the low UNK of many university courses in interior design STOP 
START in spite of this many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject STOP 
START there will be no UNK of these UNK until all art schools whether independent or attached to universities have separate UNK as do medical schools by an art UNK group such as the national association of schools of art STOP 
START independent art schools UNK degrees must naturally follow this with academic UNK by the appropriate regional group STOP

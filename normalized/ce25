START every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics STOP 
START we have noted how some electronic techniques developed for the defense effort have UNK been used in commerce and industry STOP 
START the host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more UNK because of their UNK in matters concerning our health and vitality STOP 
START when we consider the electronic industry potential for human UNK the prospect is UNK STOP 
START the author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that in this area alone the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities STOP 
START the benefits electronics can bring to UNK may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery STOP 
START we use the term UNK because of the close UNK between UNK and medical research STOP 
START electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine the UNK and the UNK machine STOP 
START recently many doctors have installed UNK UNK machines for deep UNK of UNK UNK and simple UNK STOP 
START commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are UNK tv and UNK systems for internal UNK and instruction along with radiation UNK UNK and similar devices STOP 
START in this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in UNK research UNK because this is where UNK commonplace equipment UNK STOP 
START from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques UNK in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research STOP 
START ultraviolet UNK many cells UNK and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for UNK investigation STOP 
START this UNK often UNK the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside STOP 
START a completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which UNK visible light with ultraviolet radiation and UNK a UNK with a UNK system to view the results STOP 
START fig. 1 is a UNK block UNK of the ultraviolet UNK system developed at the medical electronics center of rockefeller institute STOP 
START by UNK the talents of a medical man dr. UNK a UNK mr. UNK and an electronics expert dr. UNK this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad UNK to understanding life processes STOP 
START three different UNK of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable UNK placed in front of the three UNK UNK lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources STOP 
START these UNK are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror specimen is UNK by the UNK STOP 
START instead of the UNK eye the image UNK in the tv camera does the looking STOP 
START the UNK and UNK are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which means that all UNK must be UNK STOP 
START the UNK signal is UNK and then switched in UNK with the three ultraviolet light sources which are UNK by the rotating mirror so that during UNK of a second only one UNK corresponding to red green or blue is seen STOP 
START note because of light UNK from one ultraviolet source to another the lights are switched by a UNK assembly UNK by a UNK motor STOP 
START this assembly also supplies a UNK UNK gate for the electronics UNK STOP 
START this is the same system as was used in the UNK UNK system which preceded the present UNK system STOP 
START three separate UNK then drive a UNK UNK tube STOP 
START the result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors UNK to the three different ultraviolet UNK STOP 
START many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much shorter UNK of the ultraviolet spectrum STOP 
START different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different UNK so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color STOP 
START where the UNK under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all ultraviolet UNK and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail STOP 
START at the present time the research team which UNK this new technique is primarily interested in UNK and UNK it STOP 
START breathing UNK analyzed the medical title of UNK UNK in man by UNK c. j. martin and a. c. young covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process STOP 
START at the university of washington medical school the electronics group has developed the respiratory gas UNK shown in fig. 3 STOP 
START this unit UNK UNK the UNK can be UNK to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing STOP 
START in the lower center UNK an UNK UNK indicates the percentage of carbon UNK and nitrogen from the upper and lower UNK of one lung the total volume of UNK per breath the flow of air from both UNK and the pressure of the two UNK with respect to each other STOP 
START usually the patient UNK into a UNK while walking a UNK standing still or in some other UNK significant position STOP 
START from the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with UNK unknown accuracy and detail STOP 
START UNK techniques the original UNK primarily indicates UNK in the UNK but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the UNK UNK of the heart and its chambers and a much more detailed study of each UNK STOP 
START for many of these measurements the chest must be opened but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain UNK STOP 
START a group of UNK at the university of washington have given a paper which briefly UNK some of these techniques STOP 
START one simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube filled with UNK around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched STOP 
START a balanced resistance bridge and a pen UNK are all the electronic UNK needed STOP 
START UNK can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal UNK at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some UNK UNK energy STOP 
START the travel time of sound in tissue is about UNK meters per second it takes about 16 UNK to UNK 25 UNK of tissue STOP 
START a UNK or UNK of UNK generator and UNK measuring system is required for UNK evaluation STOP 
START in addition to the heart and UNK successful measurements of liver and UNK have also been made by this technique STOP 
START the UNK effect using UNK signals can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel STOP 
START a still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself STOP 
START it uses both an UNK UNK arrangement of the heart and a UNK carrying a UNK inserted into the UNK STOP 
START the latter measures the heat carried away by the UNK as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow STOP 
START it is also possible to UNK a pressure UNK mounted at the end of a UNK which is inserted into the UNK left UNK to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself STOP 
START this pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the UNK UNK measurement is made STOP 
START a UNK version of the UNK for this procedure is shown in fig. 2 STOP 
START UNK of the two systems are measured by a UNK circuit and a resistance bridge followed by a simple UNK computer which feeds a UNK UNK STOP 
START from this doctors can read heart rate change in diameter pressure and effective heart power STOP 
START UNK UNK several years ago UNK were made by a small radio UNK UNK which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external UNK STOP 
START this original UNK contained a battery and a UNK UNK and was about 1 cm. in diameter STOP 
START battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8 to 30 hours maximum STOP 
START a UNK of this technique has been described by UNK UNK and UNK and mr. UNK of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute STOP 
START in this novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a UNK circuit in which the UNK is formed by a UNK UNK STOP 
START as shown in fig. 4 an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited UNK times a second with short UNK UNK STOP 
START the energy received by the pill causes the UNK circuit to ring on after the burst and this UNK takes place at the UNK frequency of the pill STOP 
START these frequencies are UNK and detected by the UNK receiver after each burst of UNK energy and after the pill has been UNK precise internal pressure indications can be obtained STOP 
START one of the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the patient for several days UNK observation under natural conditions STOP 
START applications to organs other than the UNK tract are planned for future experiments STOP 
START UNK in medical research one of the most UNK applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body STOP 
START our readers are familiar with the principles of UNK where sound waves are sent out in water and the UNK then indicate UNK objects STOP 
START various methods of UNK UNK and UNK these sound waves are used to UNK submarines map ocean floors and even communicate under water STOP 
START in medicine the frequencies are much higher UNK and the UNK beams themselves are much smaller and different UNK techniques may be used but the principles involved are the same as in UNK STOP 
START because the body contains so much liquid transmission of UNK signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels STOP 
START bones and UNK UNK poorly and tend to reflect the UNK signals STOP 
START based on this phenomenon a number of investigators have used this method to look through human organs STOP 
START a good example of the results obtainable with UNK radiation is contained in papers presented by dr. g. UNK who has explored the human eye STOP 
START he can UNK UNK of the UNK where conventional methods indicate blindness due to UNK STOP 
START the method used to UNK the eye UNK is illustrated in fig. 6 STOP 
START the UNK is coupled to the body through a water bath not shown STOP 
START for display dr. UNK uses a portion of an af an UNK radar UNK and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record STOP 
START a typical UNK of a human eye together with a description of the UNK parts is shown in fig. 5 STOP 
START the frequency used for these experiments is 15 UNK and the UNK is a UNK cut crystal with an UNK lens capable of providing beam UNK smaller than one UNK STOP 
START the UNK itself moves the beam in a sector UNK just like a radar antenna while the entire UNK structure is moved over a UNK arc in front of the eye to look into all corners STOP 
START the total picture is only seen by the camera which UNK the many sector UNK over the entire UNK rotation period STOP 
START UNK UNK and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have applied the same UNK technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results STOP 
START by UNK the patient in a tub and rotating the UNK while the UNK goes on they have been able to get UNK views of the neck as shown in fig. 7 as well as many other UNK impossible insights STOP 
START as mentioned before bone reflects the sound energy and in fig. 7 the portion of the UNK shows as the black area in the center STOP 
START arteries and UNK are apparent by their black UNK centers and the surrounding white walls STOP 
START a UNK of a normal lower human leg is shown in fig. 8 with the various parts UNK STOP

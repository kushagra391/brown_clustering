START when fred UNK him back into his room the big one looking out on the back porch and put him to bed papa told him he was very tired but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown STOP 
START i've been UNK up so long he added STOP 
START getting out again seeing old friends had given his spirits a lift STOP 
START that night after supper i went back over to UNK UNK street ralph and i at that time were living at UNK UNK and ralph went with me STOP 
START papa was still UNK over his afternoon visit downtown STOP 
START baby i saw a lot of old friends i hadn't seen in a long time he told me his eyes bright STOP 
START it was mighty good for the old man to get out again STOP 
START the next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent spirits STOP 
START but a few days after UNK return he began UNK and that was the beginning of early and complete UNK STOP 
START it began in the morning and very quickly the UNK was a massive one STOP 
START we got dr. UNK to him as quickly as we could and we wired tom of UNK desperate condition STOP 
START the UNK was in the UNK region UNK saw at once what had happened STOP 
START he has lost much blood he said STOP 
START it'll take a lot to replace it STOP 
START dr. UNK i've got a lot of blood fred spoke up plenty of it STOP 
START let me give papa blood STOP 
START the doctor agreed but explained that it would be necessary first to check UNK blood to UNK whether or not it was of the same type as UNK STOP 
START to give a patient the wrong type of blood said the doctor would likely kill him STOP 
START that was in the days before blood banks of course and UNK had to be given directly from UNK to patient STOP 
START one had to find a UNK and usually very quickly whose blood UNK with the patient's STOP 
START and then it took considerably longer to make preparations for giving UNK STOP 
START they had to take blood samples to the laboratory to test them for one thing and there was much required preliminary procedure STOP 
START they made the tests and came to fred now it was perhaps two days or longer after papa had begun UNK STOP 
START fred your blood matches your father's all right dr. UNK said STOP 
START but we aren't going to let you give him any STOP 
START but why in the name of god can't i give my father blood demanded STOP 
START why can't i doctor because fred it could do him no good STOP 
START it's too late now STOP 
START he's past helping STOP 
START he's as good as gone STOP 
START and in a few minutes papa was dead STOP 
START it was well past midnight STOP 
START papa had left us about the same hour of the night that ben had passed on STOP 
START the date was june 20 UNK STOP 
START w. o. UNK prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section died shortly after midnight tuesday at his home UNK UNK street the UNK times of wednesday june 21 announced STOP 
START mr. UNK had been in UNK health for many years and death was not unexpected STOP 
START a UNK sketch followed STOP 
START funeral services were held thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home STOP 
START beloved dr. r. f. UNK our first presbyterian church pastor was in charge STOP 
START the burial was out in UNK cemetery STOP 
START all about him stood UNK his own sensitive great hands had UNK STOP 
START a few years before his death papa had agreed with mama to make a joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of the death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children whereby each child would receive a UNK of UNK cash STOP 
START at his death fred and ralph my husband were named UNK of the estate under the terms of the will STOP 
START fred and ralph qualified as UNK and paid off what debts were currently due and they were all current since papa was never one to allow bills to go UNK STOP 
START the bills were UNK for UNK and UNK fees during the last years of his life and when he died he owed in the main only current doctor's bills STOP 
START after they had paid all his debts and the funeral costs ralph and fred had some fourteen thousand dollars as i remember with which to pay the UNK STOP 
START this UNK would not provide UNK to each of the surviving five children STOP 
START so what fred and ralph did was to attempt to UNK the money fairly by taking into account what each of the five had received if anything from the estate before UNK death STOP 
START consequently fred and tom the two who had been provided college UNK signed statements to the effect that each had received his UNK in full and UNK and i were each UNK UNK STOP 
START frank had been given about half his UNK to use in a business venture before UNK death was given the difference between that amount and UNK STOP 
START tom had received four years of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard and fred had been in and out of georgia UNK and UNK UNK and part of the time had been a self-help student STOP 
START so because he had received less than tom it was felt proper that fred should receive the few hundred dollars that remained STOP 
START and that's how UNK estate was divided STOP 
START papa i should emphasize had been an UNK the last several years of his life hospital and doctor bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving little except small UNK on some properties he still owned STOP 
START had he been able to escape this long UNK of UNK i'm convinced papa would have left a sizable estate STOP 
START but he had succeeded well we agreed STOP 
START he had left us a UNK far more valuable than houses and lands and stocks and bonds STOP 
START for years papa and mama had been large taxpayers STOP 
START i recall that several years their taxes UNK UNK STOP 
START in those years of lower property UNK and lower tax rates that payment represented ownership of much property STOP 
START UNK god julia have known papa to UNK on getting his tax bill we're going to the dogs he never expected to do that STOP 
START and he didn't by a long shot STOP 
START in the spring of his second year at harvard tom had been offered a job at UNK university as an UNK in the english department STOP 
START but he had delayed accepting this job and as he was leaving to come home to papa in response to our UNK he dropped a UNK to miss UNK head of the harvard appointment office asking her please to write UNK authorities and explain the circumstances STOP 
START actually tom had been UNK giving them an answer i'm confident because he did not want to go out there to teach STOP 
START in fact he didn't want to teach anywhere STOP 
START he wanted to go back to harvard for another year of UNK STOP 
START but UNK death had further complicated the financing of UNK UNK third year and for the weeks following it tom did not know whether his return to harvard could be arranged STOP 
START but things were worked out in the family and late in august he wrote miss UNK an UNK letter in which he told her that matters at home had been in an UNK condition after UNK death and he had not known whether he would stay at home with mama accept the UNK job or return to harvard STOP 
START but he was happy to tell her that his UNK were now in such condition that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor baker STOP 
START and that's what he did STOP 
START that third year he wrote plays with a fury STOP 
START i believe there are seventeen short plays by tom now housed in the UNK library at harvard think i'm right in that figure STOP 
START that fall he submitted to professor baker the first acts and UNK of the following acts of several plays six of them according to some of his associates and he also worked on a play that he first called UNK the material for which he had collected during the summer at home STOP 
START later this play would be called welcome to our city STOP 
START in the spring it must have been he began working on the play that he called the house which later would be UNK STOP 
START that spring welcome to our city was selected for production by the UNK workshop and it was staged in the middle of may STOP 
START it ran two nights and though it was generally praised there was considerable criticism of its length STOP 
START it ran until past one o'clock STOP 
START that was UNK weakness was demonstrated many critics would later point out in the length of his novels STOP 
START in this play there were so many characters and so much detail STOP 
START tom never knew how to UNK to boil down STOP 
START he was always concerned with life and he tried to picture it whole wanted nothing UNK tight STOP 
START he was a big man and he wanted nothing little squeezed UNK UNK and particularly of words STOP 
START in this play there were some thirty or more named characters and i don't know how many more UNK STOP 
START in describing it to professor baker after it had been chosen for production he defended his great array of characters by UNK that he had included that many not because i didn't know how to save paint but because the play required them STOP 
START and he threatened someday to write a play with fifty eighty a hundred people a whole town a whole race a whole UNK STOP 
START he said he would do it though probably nobody would produce it for his own UNK ease and comfort STOP 
START that summer tom attended the summer session at harvard but he did not ask mama to send him back in the fall STOP 
START instead he went down to new york and submitted welcome to our city to the theatre UNK which had asked him to let them have a look at it after professor baker had recommended it highly STOP 
START he hung around new york waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production and in that time came down to UNK and also paid a short visit to chapel hill where with almost childish delight he visited old friends and favorite campus spots STOP 
START on returning to new york he had a job for several weeks was visiting university of north carolina UNK in new york to ask them for contributions to the graham memorial building fund STOP 
START the graham memorial would be the campus student union UNK the late and much beloved edward UNK graham who had been president when tom entered the university STOP 
START well the theatre UNK kept that play and kept it and finally in december they turned it down STOP 
START but they would UNK it they assured him if he would UNK it STOP 
START tom told me about it how one evening he went over to see the theatre UNK man STOP 
START this man tom said had the play shut up in his desk i believe and when tom sat down he pulled it out and UNK told tom that they wouldn't be able to use it STOP 
START tom said he almost burst into tears he was so disappointed and put out STOP 
START the man tom said explained that it was not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort of thing the public wanted STOP 
START the public tom said the man told him wanted realism and his play wasn't that STOP 
START it was fantastic writing beautiful writing the man declared but the public he insisted wanted realism STOP 
START tom was not willing to UNK the play according to the plan the man suggested STOP 
START such a UNK he said would ruin it would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment STOP 
START he thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made STOP

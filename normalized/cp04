START he must have UNK me henrietta murmured to the room STOP 
START the UNK of UNK last will and testament was proof enough of that would never have left her house to a UNK woman STOP 
START she found herself UNK an old wish that she had told UNK she was running away that she had left something more behind her than the loving sorry note and her best UNK pin STOP 
START perhaps UNK had guessed already and kept her counsel STOP 
START henrietta thought it's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us STOP 
START there had been more to know about UNK inevitably and most of it UNK STOP 
START UNK was the good one or if not always good less frequently tempted STOP 
START their childhood would have been quite UNK without UNK UNK for drama especially through the long summers STOP 
START in winter in the city there had been the UNK school which taught UNK with a kind of UNK passion for knowledge had been lessons in french from a small polish UNK with a really profound UNK for his pupils had been the dancing class miss UNK thin and UNK with her UNK UNK and her UNK UNK UNK STOP 
START there had been supper parties and UNK UNK and little balls mama small and pretty and gay and papa UNK UNK UNK UNK the sun around which the UNK planets UNK STOP 
START mama had died before the corruption of the family circle the UNK of charles STOP 
START it was safe to assume that papa UNK heavily had said many times to his remaining daughter thank god your poor mother was UNK this and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta to leave with her hand in UNK hand just because her poor mother was gone already and would never know STOP 
START mama was vulnerable had always felt the need to make a safe world around her STOP 
START but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta STOP 
START she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice STOP 
START only at this moment perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in UNK bed she found herself UNK how others might regard her STOP 
START perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice STOP 
START she turned on her side finding the idea UNK STOP 
START if UNK had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him to imagine UNK feeling so about anyone STOP 
START no temptation no sin STOP 
START no temptation no virtue curious thought to end a curious night STOP 
START the birds were really awake now in a UNK of music and light was beginning to UNK across the room touching UNK and door table and chair and all of UNK flowers in their artificial UNK and leaf STOP 
START before anything else she would go to UNK grave with flowers from UNK forgotten garden STOP 
START everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty of a UNK whose nature avoided UNK STOP 
START she closed her eyes remembering the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls STOP 
START it had always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray STOP 
START after the sad UNK moment waiting for comfort which could not come she slipped out of bed and went to the open window STOP 
START the garden below was UNK with UNK and UNK in its small UNK STOP 
START leaning out she could see a UNK of UNK and UNK one not quite come to bloom one just beyond it STOP 
START on a UNK spray thick with UNK and UNK and swelling pink UNK like a summer UNK a bird balanced and sang UNK brown and alive with its own music a little engine of song STOP 
START it was so pretty and UNK that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out UNK to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but UNK never permitted bare feet and she was UNK not a child but UNK UNK UNK certain age STOP 
START feeling suddenly neat and UNK she dressed quite UNK and went downstairs STOP 
START UNK UNK was not yet up and about UNK that UNK was human STOP 
START feeling protective toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday UNK and milk in a white UNK a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going UNK STOP 
START outside the garden the UNK wilderness yielded a UNK UNK of UNK sweet william UNK stock and UNK UNK which she tied with long UNK and took back to show UNK who was now stirring about the kitchen and UNK UNK STOP 
START the UNK came UNK to henrietta and begged for the flowers UNK the air with UNK UNK STOP 
START henrietta held her UNK out of reach and said it was for UNK STOP 
START UNK in the UNK said UNK UNK STOP 
START go change your shoes before you turn around STOP 
START she sounded so exactly like UNK that henrietta UNK her under the clear impression that she could either UNK or stay home STOP 
START UNK UNK eager for whatever lay beyond the door STOP 
START to a UNK there was only one church STOP 
START the cemetery UNK just behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea STOP 
START for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow street with its UNK shops just stirring and its inhabitants UNK her with the UNK curiosity STOP 
START she smiled and UNK UNK the UNK feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child STOP 
START now some of the UNK were UNK but all were interested STOP 
START an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than UNK look as she passed the UNK still plainly rising in his branches STOP 
START on an impulse she turned back and said good morning STOP 
START he UNK his ear and shook his head at her repetition UNK in a UNK way that he had heard her the first time STOP 
START he then offered his own estimate of the weather which was UNK STOP 
START UNK been slow to come he said STOP 
START it's my UNK out time STOP 
START he UNK at her flowers STOP 
START i'm taking them to the cemetery said henrietta out of a vague feeling of UNK STOP 
START they'll be UNK me next he said UNK but not so UNK they plan STOP 
START see half of 'em in their UNK before i choose my own UNK STOP 
START it's UNK myself out that does it STOP 
START he regarded her with rising hope STOP 
START you'd like to hear how i go about it STOP 
START it's nice of you henrietta said UNK STOP 
START UNK welcome STOP 
START he straightened himself UNK against the wall and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots STOP 
START his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a UNK for UNK the UNK aspects of his text STOP 
START every month UNK three days he said happily i take no water into my system no water UNK STOP 
START it rests the tissues STOP 
START henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her UNK good sense STOP 
START rests the tissues he said and UNK the system STOP 
START my dad did it and he lived to a great age STOP 
START he looked up at her sharply STOP 
START don't remember do you did suddenly through the link of memory with his father old UNK who must have been in his UNK when henrietta ran away STOP 
START next to the UNK UNK had owned the island most and she and UNK had often stood in front of him UNK by his terrible years a UNK man with a thin beard and very UNK blue eyes like a UNK more aged than possible STOP 
START he had never spoken once to the UNK sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a UNK captain and powerful like the sea STOP 
START it must be that son who sat before her now UNK to half his size and half his senses STOP 
START she said gently of course i remember you STOP 
START not so UNK i remember you he said STOP 
START UNK the young UNK woman STOP 
START ran away on a black night with a UNK UNK man STOP 
START i know all about you STOP 
START you do seem to said henrietta impressed STOP 
START can't blame a man for UNK his wife he said quite UNK STOP 
START left mine many a time only she never knew it STOP 
START man in a boat there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit STOP 
START any harm in that probably said henrietta UNK STOP 
START he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her UNK STOP 
START you'd be the one to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different since all actions had their own laws STOP 
START only this old man's UNK was even less to her taste than UNK UNK open UNK STOP 
START well she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned STOP 
START she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow STOP 
START she started to move away just as a woman came out of the cottage a UNK UNK figure with a clean UNK tied over her limp print dress STOP 
START she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man STOP 
START you've not had your breakfast yet UNK STOP 
START UNK UNK UNK is no breakfast he said STOP 
START milk and UNK beat the air with his stick and it fell from his UNK and UNK on the stones STOP 
START he's UNK today his UNK said UNK and bent to pick it up STOP 
START he's got this idea about drying out it ain't an idea if it ain't an idea she said how comes it you can drink beer but not water looked UNK to heaven and said beer don't affect the tissues none and the UNK UNK of this defense pleased henrietta so that she UNK him his UNK of UNK STOP 
START his UNK sighed STOP 
START come on do STOP 
START the children are eating and miss UNK on her way UNK STOP 
START to the UNK STOP 
START who ain't not me STOP 
START i've got a day's work to do STOP 
START you'll be visiting miss UNK UNK nodded STOP 
START how much they knew about her woman she must have been a tiny baby when UNK and UNK had stood arm in arm watching great age grow small answered the nod with her own STOP 
START god rest her soul she was a sweet one STOP 
START come on now STOP 
START she put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up UNK with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old STOP 
START he UNK at her but let himself be led off inside the house UNK UNK to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was UNK about by those who still had their UNK strength STOP 
START there was a UNK of voices from UNK young hungry sounds like cats after fish and a burst of UNK from the old man STOP 
START henrietta looked down at her UNK still lively with its color and UNK and set her feet on their UNK way again leaving the village street and crossing the first field UNK dancing ahead of her STOP 
START at the edge of the field the wild rolling land took over UNK with fat round UNK like sheep STOP 
START they were covered with tiny white UNK their UNK roots UNK at the UNK ground and wild birds UNK in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the UNK and cry STOP 
START the air was full of sounds too but UNK ones a UNK UNK as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky STOP 
START she felt UNK walking and almost easy until the church UNK told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to UNK STOP 
START both church and UNK were smaller than she remembered them how many things had UNK while she was gone away but the UNK had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named UNK UNK seemed suddenly impossible STOP 
START she sat down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with UNK her fingers tracing the UNK carved letters UNK with green UNK STOP 
START the day's sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished she had brought her UNK if only to shade UNK flowers STOP 
START a small UNK angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel in the cemetery STOP 
START she remembered suddenly a night of savage moonlight and UNK clouds when she and UNK having dared each other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in hand hoping and UNK UNK STOP

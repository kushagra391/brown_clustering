START in a few school districts one finds a link between school and job STOP 
START in those vocational programs organized with UNK money there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other STOP 
START in these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12 STOP 
START the apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis usually at night perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school STOP 
START these opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such UNK as auto mechanics UNK UNK electrical work UNK work and UNK work STOP 
START formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation STOP 
START the UNK UNK program is a part-time UNK program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers STOP 
START the UNK education program operates in a similar way with arrangements between the school and employers in UNK fields STOP 
START in both cases the student UNK school UNK and works in a regular job the other half STOP 
START he receives UNK for his work STOP 
START in a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in UNK work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student while still in school to develop skills which are immediately UNK upon graduation STOP 
START adult education courses UNK programs of various sorts these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in UNK educational opportunities for UNK youth STOP 
START in general however it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next STOP 
START if the student drops out of high school the break with the school is even more complete STOP 
START when there is employment opportunity for youth this arrangement or lack of arrangement works out quite well STOP 
START indeed in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the UNK quit school at an early age and went to work STOP 
START UNK this has represented a loss to the nation although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in UNK may have been a wise one STOP 
START i make no attempt to measure the UNK satisfaction and material UNK of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered STOP 
START he may or may not be better off than his UNK who went on to a college and professional school STOP 
START but in the next decades the nation needs to UNK for the UNK all the potential professional talent STOP 
START in a later chapter dealing with the suburban school i shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the UNK UNK and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found STOP 
START in the negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation STOP 
START high motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work STOP 
START undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the negro schools STOP 
START however the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is UNK STOP 
START and the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of negroes in positions of intellectual leadership STOP 
START this is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern universities STOP 
START quite the contrary as i can UNK from personal experience as a former university president STOP 
START rather we see here another vicious circle STOP 
START the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to UNK down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic careers STOP 
START i believe the situation is improving but the success stories need to be heavily UNK STOP 
START here again we run into the UNK that negroes do not like to be designated as negroes in the press STOP 
START how can the vicious circle be broken is a problem to which leaders of opinion both negro and white should devote far more attention STOP 
START it is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of UNK in the south STOP 
START vocational education i should like to UNK four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education STOP 
START first and foremost vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation STOP 
START second vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the UNK time in those years for slow UNK and prospective UNK these courses ought to begin earlier STOP 
START third the significance of the vocational courses is that those UNK are UNK interested in the work realize the UNK of what they are learning to their future careers and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time STOP 
START fourth the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general UNK STOP 
START this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few if any graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training the whole idea of UNK UNK STOP 
START vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a UNK skill becomes just another school UNK for those whose interest in their studies has begun to UNK STOP 
START those who because of population UNK and the UNK desire of employers to train their own employees would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience STOP 
START i have been using the word vocational as a UNK would at first sight think it should be used STOP 
START i intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls STOP 
START these courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the UNK academic STOP 
START practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of UNK can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill STOP 
START they are in this sense skills UNK immediately on graduation from high school STOP 
START to be sure in UNK work and in the building UNK the first job must be often on an apprentice basis but two years of UNK vocational training UNK the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status STOP 
START similarly a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of UNK and the use of UNK machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or UNK school STOP 
START of course it can be argued that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of UNK is a UNK skill STOP 
START so too is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has UNK in mathematics STOP 
START in a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his UNK which may be a profession will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained STOP 
START in spite of the UNK of one type of course into another i believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses STOP 
START perhaps a course in UNK might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule STOP 
START today many college bound students try to take a course in personal UNK as they feel a certain degree of UNK of this skill is almost essential for one who UNK to do academic work in college and a professional school STOP 
START most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools STOP 
START in this respect public education in the large cities UNK from education in the smaller cities and UNK school districts STOP 
START the neighborhood high schools are not strictly speaking comprehensive schools because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school STOP 
START indeed one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs STOP 
START he UNK to UNK such schools as general high schools STOP 
START the suburban high school it is worth noting also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs STOP 
START the reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community STOP 
START therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report STOP 
START the separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be UNK as permanent institutions STOP 
START by and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system STOP 
START it is not often realized to what degree certain UNK are in many communities closed areas of employment except for a lucky few STOP 
START one has to talk UNK with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say i want to be a UNK and then by doing good work find a job STOP 
START it is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation STOP 
START two stories will illustrate what i have in mind STOP 
START one vocational UNK in a city vocational school speaking of his course in a certain field said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city STOP 
START in the city he said the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in STOP 
START in a far distant part of the united states i was talking to an UNK about a boy who in the UNK grade was doing special work STOP 
START what does he have in mind to do when he graduates oh he'll be a UNK came the answer STOP 
START but isn't it almost impossible to get into the union asked STOP 
START he'll have no difficulty i was told STOP 
START he has very good connections STOP 
START in my view there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city STOP 
START UNK these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest STOP 
START an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the UNK vocational high school in chicago STOP 
START located in a bad UNK area now undergoing UNK this school and its program are especially UNK to the vocational aims of its students STOP 
START hardly a window has been broken since UNK first was opened and UNK in schools is a major problem in many UNK areas STOP 
START i discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were negroes STOP 
START they were learning UNK as diverse as shoe UNK UNK UNK cabinet making auto mechanics and airplane mechanics STOP 
START the physical facilities at UNK are impressive but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils STOP

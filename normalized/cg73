START the recent experiments in the new UNK movement seen by some as part of the san francisco renaissance have been as popular as they are UNK STOP 
START it might well start a UNK like UNK UNK or UNK golf wrote UNK UNK in an UNK note in the UNK review and he may have been right STOP 
START under the general heading UNK widely UNK experiments have been carried out STOP 
START lawrence UNK and UNK UNK have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician STOP 
START even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry STOP 
START UNK UNK now has poems as well as UNK written for her STOP 
START but the best known UNK of the new medium are UNK UNK and UNK patchen STOP 
START UNK and patchen are far apart UNK and UNK in their experiments STOP 
START UNK is a UNK jazz UNK a UNK of jazz heroes and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz STOP 
START in san francisco he has worked with UNK moore charlie UNK and other swinging musicians of secure reputation thus placing himself within established jazz traditions in addition to being a part of the san francisco school STOP 
START although patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz the musical group that he works with the chamber jazz UNK is often ignored by jazz critics STOP 
START UNK did not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen and the UNK although the engagement lasted over two months STOP 
START the stated goal of the UNK is the synthesis of jazz and serious music STOP 
START UNK musicians are UNK in established jazz circles and patchen himself has remained outside the san francisco poetry group maintaining a UNK isolation even though his conversion to UNK is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear STOP 
START he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 and his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with the form and presentation of his poetry STOP 
START however his subject matter and basic UNK have remained surprisingly consistent and these together with certain key poetic images may be traced through all his work including the new jazz experiments STOP 
START from the beginning of his career patchen has adopted an UNK approach to poetry STOP 
START his first book before the brave UNK is a collection of poems that are almost all UNK but after publication of this book he rejected communism and UNK a UNK UNK though UNK his revolutionary UNK STOP 
START he spoke for a UNK that included all the lost and sick and UNK of the earth STOP 
START patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by UNK and UNK people STOP 
START running counter to the destroying forces in the world are all the virtues that are UNK in man the capacity for love and UNK the ability to appreciate beauty STOP 
START beauty as well as love is UNK and patchen UNK a kind of moral salvation STOP 
START this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven STOP 
START in UNK eyes organized churches are as UNK as organized governments and christian symbols having been taken over by the UNK classes are now agents of corruption STOP 
START patchen UNK a dark kingdom which stands above the waters as a UNK warning man of danger from his own kind STOP 
START the dark kingdom UNK angels of death and other UNK UNK down to us with stern UNK STOP 
START actually heaven and the dark kingdom UNK form two aspects of UNK life after death STOP 
START patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms has UNK instead with personal UNK STOP 
START much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a UNK myth reference which is concerned with imaginary places and beings described in UNK and UNK language STOP 
START these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying to patchen STOP 
START beginning in cloth of the UNK 1943 he UNK in UNK poetry and visual art using drawings to carry long narrative UNK of a story as in UNK awake and UNK elaborate UNK in which it is impossible to distinguish between the art and the poetry STOP 
START art UNK or UNK UNK did not meet all of UNK requirements for a poetic frame of reference STOP 
START many of his poems UNK to be exactly contemporary and political during the period approximately from 1941 to 1946 patchen often used private detective stories as a myth reference and the private eye as a myth hero STOP 
START speaking in terms of sociological stereotype the private eye might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons STOP 
START the private detective at least in the minds of listeners and readers all over the country is an individual hero fighting injustice STOP 
START he is usually something of an UNK he must battle the organized police force as well as recognized UNK STOP 
START the private detective must rely as the youngest son or UNK hero does in primitive myth on his UNK STOP 
START the private detective is UNK against injustice a humorous and ironic UNK of the UNK important to patchen he was a UNK hero and very contemporary STOP 
START in 1945 probably almost every american not only knew who sam UNK was but had some kind of emotional feeling about him STOP 
START in the UNK of a shy UNK 1945 patchen UNK this national sentiment by making his hero albert UNK a private detective STOP 
START but since 1945 sam UNK has UNK a UNK has become friday on UNK a UNK of arbitrary police authority STOP 
START he has like so many other secular and religious culture symbols gone over to the side of the ruling classes STOP 
START obviously the private eye can have no more appeal for patchen STOP 
START to fill the job of contemporary hero in 1955 patchen needed someone else STOP 
START it was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician STOP 
START the revolution in jazz that took place around 1949 the evolution from the UNK school of UNK UNK to the cool sound of miles davis and UNK UNK lee UNK and the whole legend of charlie parker had made an impression on many academic and literary men STOP 
START the UNK between the east coast and west coast schools of jazz the differences between the hard UNK school of UNK and the UNK experiments of UNK UNK and UNK the general differences in the UNK of white and negro musicians all had become fairly well known to certain UNK of the public STOP 
START the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry as he had previously attempted the union of UNK art and poetry STOP 
START in addition to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the private detective a decade ago STOP 
START in this respect his approach to UNK is in marked contrast to UNK UNK STOP 
START UNK uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz including many of his chinese and japanese UNK usually draws some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading for instance he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an oriental UNK waiting for the man she loves and who never comes and the old blues UNK of ma UNK and other negro singers but usually the comparison is UNK STOP 
START UNK may sometimes achieve an effective UNK but he rarely makes any effort to capture any jazz feeling in the text of his poems UNK on his very competent musicians to supply this feeling STOP 
START patchen does read some of his earlier works to music but he has written an entire book of short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz STOP 
START these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians but they show changes in UNK approach to his poetry for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician STOP 
START it is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician STOP 
START everyone knows that private detectives in real life are not like sam UNK and pat UNK but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked STOP 
START seen by the public the musician is the UNK par excellence STOP 
START he is forced to play for little money and must often take another job to live STOP 
START his approach to music is highly UNK UNK is on UNK rather than arrangements STOP 
START while he is UNK the musician often UNK public attitudes of UNK UNK and UNK STOP 
START the musician is UNK and UNK is far from being a literary hero yet is a creative artist STOP 
START many of these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective but where the detective is active and UNK the jazz musician is passive almost a victim of society STOP 
START in order to write with authority either about musicians or as a musician patchen would have to soft UNK his UNK UNK anger and change at least for the purposes of this poetry from a revolutionary to a victim STOP 
START he must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world but who UNK doing anything about it STOP 
START this involves a shift in UNK attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry STOP 
START he has shown considerable UNK in UNK his earliest symbols and devices to the new work and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry STOP 
START perhaps tracing some of these more important symbols through the body of his work will show that UNK new poetry is well thought out and remains within the UNK of his work while being suited to a new form STOP 
START henry miller characterized patchen as a man of anger and light STOP 
START his revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems STOP 
START the following passage from the UNK great hands UNK the UNK of this anger STOP 
START anger won't help STOP 
START i was born angry STOP 
START angry that my father was being UNK alive in the mills that none of us knew anything but UNK and poverty STOP 
START angry because i was that very one somebody was supposed to be fighting for STOP 
START this angry and UNK UNK which patchen has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years has been successfully UNK into a kind of UNK that is as effective as anger and still UNK his disapproval of the modern world STOP 
START in his recent book UNK for anything 1957 one of the most important short poems and it is the title poem for one of the long jazz arrangements is written for UNK with jazz STOP 
START although it does not follow the UNK rules for a blues to be sung the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling STOP 
START i went to the city and there i did weep men UNK like UNK and living like sheep STOP 
START oh can't hold the UNK of my love hold her little white UNK i went to the city and there i did bitterly cry men out of touch with the earth and with never a glance at the sky STOP 
START oh can't hold the UNK of my love hold her pure little UNK patchen is still the rebel but he writes in a UNK UNK tone STOP 
START neither of these poems is an UNK is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the poet's development STOP 
START patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death STOP 
START in many of his poems death comes by train a strongly UNK visual image STOP 
START perhaps patchen was once involved in a train accident and this passage from first will and testament may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he first saw it if he did lord love us look at all the UNK UNK floating UNK like UNK feathers at that and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the tongue are in all the cheek STOP

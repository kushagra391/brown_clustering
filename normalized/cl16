START and you know i can do it STOP 
START griffith raised UNK hands STOP 
START easy does it phil STOP 
START i was just going STOP 
START i'm on my way STOP 
START he turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back STOP 
START on the second landing he paused to look for UNK didn't see him and accepted a glass of champagne STOP 
START he took several large UNK UNK that UNK had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him STOP 
START the way hoag was no telling what he might say or do STOP 
START he finished his champagne and climbed UNK to the next landing STOP 
START at the top a UNK officer blocked further progress STOP 
START yes what is it asked STOP

START he spotted UNK coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him STOP 
START UNK said it's okay UNK let him by STOP 
START they walked toward each other STOP 
START well said hoag told me to tell you he waited until they were close was UNK embarrassing not to let the prime minister be alone with UNK STOP 
START griffith looked UNK to the captain would be just like him STOP 
START why not he claims UNK in a plot to kill the p.m. STOP 
START UNK went UNK was it possible the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared possible he thought prime minister knew who his enemy was here wasn't going to allow himself to be led UNK to the UNK STOP 
START and if by some wild chance UNK was the man he wouldn't dare try anything now not after UNK had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well STOP 
START UNK was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the UNK truck STOP 
START one more UNK play like that one and they'd be leading him away STOP 
START still this had to be checked out STOP 
START UNK your friend hoag get his information asked STOP 
START haven't the UNK captain STOP 
START would you mind sending him up here like to talk to him STOP 
START troubled he continued along the corridor UNK his head into the next office for a careful look around STOP 
START but hoag had not stayed on the front steps when griffith disappeared into the building STOP 
START he was UNK to rely on UNK carrying his message and he had no confidence the police would act on it STOP 
START if UNK was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here shivering in the UNK street STOP 
START he would have to do something on his own STOP 
START but what door opened and three men and a woman in a UNK swept past him and down the stairs STOP 
START in the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their UNK STOP 
START these were the early UNK half an hour the reception would be over STOP 
START if UNK was planning to set up the prime minister for UNK he would have to do it in the next few minutes STOP 
START hoag UNK the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building STOP 
START wide windows with many small UNK UNK swept across the upper stories STOP 
START on the second floor he saw the UNK faces of the party guests scene looked like a christmas card STOP 
START on the third floor one of the two windows was lighted was framed in UNK UNK and no faces were visible STOP 
START this would be UNK office STOP 
START he and the prime minister would be back from the window seated at UNK desk would be going over papers UNK had saved as excuse for just such a meeting STOP 
START in a minute or five minutes the business would be done would stand up the prime minister would follow STOP 
START UNK would direct the prime UNK attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side STOP 
START the single shot would come would carry its sound to his grave STOP 
START UNK of course would be UNK STOP 
START how was he to suspect that an UNK had been UNK somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance turned STOP 
START where across the street was UNK waiting with the rifle UNK buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf STOP 
START most of them could be eliminated would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite STOP 
START the UNK was UNK set back from the building line the angle of fire were too great the UNK buildings on either side would UNK STOP 
START would the shot come from a roof ran his eye along the roof UNK at once a figure UNK up STOP 
START but UNK UNK on the dark form were the UNK and UNK of a policeman STOP 
START with a cop UNK the road UNK would have to be inside a building if he was here at all and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at la UNK airport STOP 
START hoag crossed the narrow street UNK between parked cars to reach the sidewalk STOP 
START from this side he could see farther into the UNK UNK window but he saw no faces UNK UNK were still seated or they had been called into the UNK by an UNK police captain STOP 
START if only the latter were true STOP 
START he walked rapidly along the buildings UNK their UNK one was a club that was out others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted STOP 
START that left three possibly four one looking much like the next STOP 
START he climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the UNK STOP 
START he quickly closed it again STOP 
START he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments but this one from a glance at the hall UNK was obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance STOP 
START he went on to the next building and found what he expected the UNK cooking UNK of a public UNK STOP 
START on one wall was the brass front of a row of UNK were six apartments STOP 
START now what names on the UNK meant nothing to him STOP 
START this was UNK he had no idea what to look for STOP 
START he peered in the boxes themselves were empty except one and that one was UNK with letters and magazines STOP 
START the UNK of apartment number 3 were probably away for a few days and not likely to return on a friday STOP 
START had UNK made the same deduction was attracted to the UNK of UNK STOP 
START he opened the inner door cooking UNK were stronger all over the city at this hour UNK would be UNK over UNK STOP 
START he climbed as quickly as he could urge his body up the two UNK flights to the third floor pulling himself along on a delicate UNK all that remained of the UNK beauty STOP 
START he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak UNK overhead STOP 
START now he was certain the lock had not yielded to UNK collection of keys UNK showed that the door had been UNK open STOP 
START it had been shut again but the lock was broken noted with a UNK of fear that the door moved under his touch STOP 
START what was he to do now had thought no further than finding UNK STOP 
START he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find him that UNK would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond UNK control STOP 
START he could not break in on an armed man STOP 
START he would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop STOP 
START was there time thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door STOP 
START hoag pushed open the door at the far end of the long dark room UNK was UNK UNK against the window the rifle still raised stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the UNK STOP 
START he turned his head to the source of the UNK and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight UNK hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at UNK apartment STOP 
START hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and UNK for the switch evil UNK in the dark STOP 
START the room was UNK in light at the instant UNK second shot came STOP 
START UNK UNK exposed at the bright window like a deer UNK in a UNK UNK threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table face wore a look of UNK STOP 
START a shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain following UNK of shots shattered glass UNK the ceiling and sent him UNK heavily from the table STOP 
START he was dead before his body made contact with the floor STOP 
START hoag stumbled back into the hall leaned against the wall and started to UNK STOP 
START after captain UNK sent UNK griffith for hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned UNK up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne STOP

START this broad delegation leaves within our discretion subject to the UNK criterion of the public interest both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided STOP 
START 3 STOP 
START -hlthe present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast am band from UNK UNK to UNK UNK STOP 
START whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies each UNK to some extent with reception of the other STOP 
START the extent of such interference which may be so slight as to be UNK at any point where either of the stations UNK a UNK signal or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations depends on many factors among the principal ones being the distance between the stations their respective UNK power and of particular significance here the time of day STOP 
START other factors playing a part in the extent of am service and interference are the frequency involved the time of year the position of the year in the UNK cycle ground UNK along the transmission path UNK and UNK noise and others STOP 
START with the existence of these many factors some of them variable it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the commission to make assignments of am stations on a UNK basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances STOP 
START rather such assignments are made as they must be on the basis of certain overall rules and standards representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem taking into account for each situation some of the variables e.g. power and station UNK and UNK out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation STOP 
START an example of the overall standards applied is the UNK ratio established for the determination of that degree of UNK interference which is regarded as UNK STOP 
START by this standard it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved UNK interference from station a exists at any point within the service area of station b where station UNK signal is of an intensity UNK or more of the strength of station UNK signal at that point STOP 
START 4 STOP 
START -hlthe UNK ratio for UNK interference UNK one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in am assignments and UNK that signals from a particular station are potential sources of UNK interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service STOP 
START a second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding the difference between nighttime and daytime UNK conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies STOP 
START this is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the UNK layer in the upper atmosphere known as the UNK STOP 
START all am stations UNK both skywave and UNK signals at all hours during the middle daytime hours these skywave UNK are not reflected in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are in general UNK STOP 
START but during nighttime hours the skywave UNK are reflected from the UNK thereby creating the possibility of one UNK rendering service via skywave at a much greater distance than it can through its UNK signal and at the same time UNK UNK the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies STOP 
START because of the difference between daytime and nighttime UNK conditions it has been necessary to UNK different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime UNK in the am band with many more stations operating during the day than at night STOP 
START 5 STOP 
START -hlit was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime UNK conditions and vice UNK is not an UNK process but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset and again from roughly 2 hours before UNK until some 2 hours after UNK STOP 
START during the period of about 4 hours around sunset skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions UNK the same period around UNK skywave transmission is UNK until at about 2 hours after UNK it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance STOP 
START however in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations representing an UNK of conditions and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the UNK points between daytime and nighttime conditions STOP 
START it was determined that the hours of UNK and sunset respectively should be used for this purpose STOP 
START accordingly the UNK rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations STOP 
START class 2 stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset for daytime class 2 stations or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 station where located west of the class 2 station for UNK class 2 stations STOP 
START the same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 stations operating on regional channels which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other STOP 
START with respect to nighttime assignments the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves figs. 1 and 2 of sec. UNK of the rules giving average skywave values STOP 
START these curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data STOP 
START it was recognized that skywave signals because of their reflected nature are of great UNK and subject to wide UNK in strength STOP 
START for this reason the more uncertain skywave service was UNK secondary in our rules as compared to the UNK more reliable UNK primary service and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular UNK level is UNK 50 percent of the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference STOP 
START allocation policies 6 STOP 
START UNK mentioned the allocation of am stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations STOP 
START the rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the nation STOP 
START our objectives as we have stated many times are 1 to provide some service to all listeners 2 to provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible 3 to provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible STOP 
START since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number these objectives are to some extent UNK in that not all of them can be fully realized and to the extent that each is realized there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for UNK achievement of the others STOP 
START accordingly the commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations STOP 
START some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant class 1 a or class 1 b UNK stations designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service both UNK and at night skywave over large areas and at great distances being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective STOP 
START in dealing with these frequencies the objective listed first above provision of service to all listeners was UNK other objectives were UNK to it STOP 
START the class 1 stations on these clear channels are protected to their UNK UNK contours against daytime UNK interference STOP 
START with respect to skywave service rendered at night class 1 a stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the united states on clear channels specified for class 1 a operation and so render skywave service free from UNK interference UNK they may be received 1 b stations are protected at night to their UNK UNK time skywave contours against UNK interference STOP 
START since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference only class 1 stations are capable of rendering skywave service STOP 
START but nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course UNK skywave interference to UNK service interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it STOP 
START 7 STOP 
START UNK respect to other frequencies these are designated as regional or local and assigned for use by class 3 and class 4 stations respectively stations operating generally with lower power STOP 
START in the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies the provision of long-range service has to some extent been UNK to the other two objectives assignment of multiple facilities and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible STOP 
START 8 STOP 
START UNK mentioned the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference STOP 
START during nighttime hours because of the intense skywave UNK then prevailing no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be UNK upon to render it STOP 
START therefore under our UNK allocation rules on some of these channels no station other than the dominant class 1 a station is permitted to operate at night so that the 1 a station can render service interference free wherever it can be received STOP 
START on the remainder of the clear channels the dominant class 1 b stations are protected as described above and the relatively small number of secondary class 2 stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate UNK and with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 stations STOP 
START in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission is relatively UNK it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels STOP 
START additional class 2 assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 stations or to each other and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local UNK for a large number of communities STOP 
START such additional daytime class 2 assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies and the commission has over the years made a large number of them STOP 
START similarly on the regional channels many class 3 stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with UNK UNK and lower power STOP 
START 9 STOP 
START UNK the question presented for decision in the present daytime skywave proceeding is whether our decision in UNK to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from UNK to sunset is sound as a basis for am UNK or whether in the light of later developments and new understanding skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after UNK that this condition should be taken into account and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours STOP 
START the history of the proceeding 10 STOP 
START -hlthe decision reached in UNK was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof STOP 
START since then there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it leading to a better understanding of UNK phenomena STOP 
START in 1947 UNK were filed with the commission by various UNK stations UNK that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours from class 2 stations whose signals were being reflected from the UNK so as to create skywave UNK STOP
